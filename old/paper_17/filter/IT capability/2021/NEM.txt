benefits at end of year at december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, $335, $369 and $459, respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties that, if recognized, would impact the company's effective income tax rate.
the company operates in numerous countries around the world and is subject to, and pays annual income taxes under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. the company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably determined to be due. the tax rules and regulations in many countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. from time to time, the company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the company's business conducted within the country involved.
the australian taxation office ("ato") is conducting a limited review of the company's prior year tax returns. the ato is reviewing an internal reorganization executed in 2011 when newmont completed a restructure of the shareholding in the company's australian subsidiaries. to date, the company has responded to inquiries from the ato and provided them with supporting documentation for the transaction and the company's associated tax positions. one aspect of the ato review relates to an australian capital gains tax that applies to sales or transfers of stock in certain types of entities. in the fourth quarter of 2017, the ato notified the company that it believes the 2011
reorganization is subject to capital gains tax of approximately $85 (including interest and penalties). the company disputes this conclusion and intends to vigorously defend its position that the transaction is not subject to this tax. in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company made a $24 payment to the ato and lodged an appeal with the australian federal court to preserve its right to contest the ato conclusions on this matter. the company reflects this payment as a receivable as it believes that it will ultimately prevail in this dispute. the company continues to monitor the status of the ato's review which it expects to continue throughout 2022.
see note 26 for a discussion on the audit settlement payments related to the yanacocha tax dispute and tax reassessment from the mexican tax authority.
the company and/or subsidiaries file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal, state and local, and non-u.s. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015. as a result of (i) statute of limitations that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions, and (ii) possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its unrecognized income tax liability will decrease between $110
the company's practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income and mining tax benefit (expense) . at december 31, 2021 and 2020, the total amount of accrued income-tax-
other no additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.

the company's qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with internal revenue service rules and regulations. the company's non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. the information contained in the above tables presents the combined funded status of qualified and non-qualified plans. the company reviews its retirement benefit programs on a regular basis and will consider market conditions and the funded status of its qualified pension plans in determining whether additional contributions are appropriate in calendar year 2022.
as of december 31, 2021, all pension benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of assets with the exception of one defined benefit pension plan in the u.s. and one defined benefit pension plan in canada. the fair value of the plan assets associated with these pension benefit plans was in excess of the related accumulated benefit obligations. as of december 31, 2020, all pension benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of assets. the following table provides information for the company's defined benefit pensions plans that had aggregate accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at december 31:
pension benefits(1)
accumulated benefit obligation    $                   43    $  1,095

(1) information for other benefit plans with an accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets has not be included as all of the other benefit plans are unfunded.
the significant assumptions used in measuring the company's benefit obligation were mortality assumptions and discount rate.
the mortality assumptions used to measure the pension and other post retirement obligation incorporate future mortality improvements from tables published by the society of actuaries. the company utilized the pri-2012
mortality tables and the mp-2020 generational projection scale to measure the pension and other post retirement obligations as of december 31, 2020. in october 2021, the society of actuaries released a new generational projection scale, mp-2021. the company utilized the pri-2012 mortality tables and the mp-2021 generational projection scales to measure the pension and other post retirement obligations as of december 31, 2021.
yield curves matching the company's benefit obligations were derived using a model based on high quality corporate bond data from bloomberg. the model develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose projected cash flows match the projected benefit payments of the plan. the resulting curves were used to identify a weighted average discount rate for the company of 3.06% and 2.77% at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, based on the timing of future benefit payments.
settlement accounting is required when annual lump sum payments exceed the annual interest and service costs for a plan and results in a remeasurement of the related pension benefit obligation and plan assets and the recognition of settlement charges in other income (loss), net due to the acceleration of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses. the lump sum payments were made primarily from the plan assets resulting in a pension settlement charge of

actuarial losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining future service period of the current active participants.
the significant assumptions used in measuring the company's total benefit cost (credit) and other comprehensive income (loss) were discount rate and expected return on plan assets:
pension benefits                               other benefits years ended                                  years ended december 31,                                 december 31,
weighted average assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost:
expected return                6.75  %    6.75  %    6.75  %                      n/a          n/a          n/a on plan assets the expected long-term return on plan assets used for each period in the three years ended december 31, 2021 was determined based on an analysis of the asset returns over multiple time horizons for the company's actual plan and for other comparable u.s. corporations. at december 31, 2021, newmont has estimated the expected long-term return on plan assets to be 6.75% which will be used in determining future net periodic benefit cost. the company determines the long-term return on plan assets by considering the most recent capital market forecasts, the plans'
newmont has two pension calculations for salaried u.s. employees. the first is a "final average pay" pension calculation which pays a monthly amount to employees in retirement based, in part, on their highest five year eligible earnings and years of credited service. the second is the "stable value" calculation which provides a lump sum payment to employees upon retirement. the
amount of the lump sum is the total of annual accruals based on the employee's eligible earnings and years of service. the benefits accrued under the final average pay formula were frozen on june 30, 2014 for those eligible employees. beginning july 1, 2014, all future accruals are based on the terms and features of the stable value calculation.
the pension plans employ an independent investment firm which invests the assets of the plans in certain approved funds that correspond to specific asset classes with associated target allocations. the goal of the pension fund investment program is to achieve prudent actuarial funding ratios while maintaining acceptable risk levels. the investment performance of the plans and that of the individual investment firms is measured against recognized market indices. the performance of the pension funds are monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the company's management, which is advised by an independent investment consultant. with the exception of global capital market economic risks, the company has identified no significant portfolio risks associated to asset classes. the following is a summary of the target asset allocations for 2021 and the actual asset allocation at december 31, 2021.
u.s. equity investments                    11  %                        12  %

international equity investments)
cash and cash equivalent instruments are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets, which are primarily invested in money market securities and u.s. treasury securities.
the pension plans' commingled fund investments are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the net asset value per share for each fund. although the majority of the underlying assets in the funds consist of actively traded equity securities and bonds, the unit of account is considered to be at the fund level. these funds require less than a month's notice for redemptions and can be redeemed at the net asset value per share.
the assumed health care trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits is 6.00% in 2022 and 2023 and decreases gradually each year to 5.00% in 2027, which is used thereafter.
cash flows benefit payments expected to be paid to pension plan participants are as follows: $61 in 2022, $62 in 2023, $63 in
2024, $61 in 2025, $63 in 2026 and $313 in total over the five years from 2027 through 2031. benefit payments made to other benefit plan participants are expected to be as follows: $6 in 2022, $6 in 2023, $6 in 2024, $6 in 2025,
savings plans the company has one qualified defined contribution savings plan in the u.s. that covers salaried and non-union hourly employees. when an employee meets eligibility requirements, the company matches 100% of employee contributions of up to 6% of eligible earnings. hourly non-union employees receive an additional retirement contribution to the participant's retirement contribution account equal to an amount which is paid and determined by the company. currently, the additional retirement contribution is 5% of eligible earnings. matching contributions are made in cash. in addition, the company has one non-qualified supplemental savings plan for executive-level employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal regulations.
note 14 stock-based compensation the company has stock incentive plans for directors, executives and eligible employees. stock incentive awards include restricted stock units ("rsus") and performance leveraged stock units ("psus"). the company issues new shares of common stock to
satisfy option exercises and vesting under all of its stock incentive awards. prior to 2012, the company also granted options to purchase shares of stock with exercise prices not less than fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. at december 31, 2021, 22,796,541 shares were authorized for future stock incentive plan awards.
restricted stock units the company grants rsus to directors, executives and eligible employees. awards are determined as a target percentage of base salary and, for eligible employees, are subject to a personal performance factor. for all rsu grants issued prior to february 2018, rsu awards vest on a straight-line basis over periods of three years or more, unless the employee becomes retirement eligible prior to the vesting date. if an employee becomes retirement eligible and retires prior to the vesting date, the remaining awards vest on a pro rata basis at the retirement date. starting with the february 2018 grant, if the employee becomes retirement eligible at any point during the vesting period, the entire award is considered earned after the later of the one year service period from the grant date or the retirement eligible date. prior to vesting, holders of rsus do not have the right to vote the underlying shares; however, directors, executives and eligible employees accrue dividend equivalents on their rsus, which are paid at the time the rsus vest. the accrued dividend equivalents are not paid if rsus are forfeited. the rsus are subject to forfeiture risk and other restrictions. upon vesting, the employee is entitled to receive one share of the company's common stock for each restricted stock unit.
performance stock units the company grants psus to eligible executives that vest after a three year performance period based on the company's total shareholder return compared to the return of a peer group. the grant date fair value of the awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the required performance period.
the grant date fair value of the market conditions for each psu granted in 2021, 2020 or 2019 was determined using a monte carlo valuation model, which requires the input of the following subjective assumptions:
volatility range                              31.41% - 76.72%    24.71% - 43.91%    33.50% - 58.40%
weighted-average volatility                            53.05%             35.38%             44.49%
the risk-free interest rates are based on a u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company's stock as well as the stock of the peer group for the three-year performance period.
2020 or 2019. at december 31, 2020, there were 48,956 options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $59.64. during 2021, 44,006 options were exercised and 4,950 options expired with weighted average exercise prices of $59.75 and $58.69, respectively. at december 31, 2021, there were no options outstanding and exercisable.
goldcorp options in connection with the newmont goldcorp transaction, the company exchanged 3.6 million outstanding goldcorp options
("goldcorp options") for 1.2 million newmont options with the right to exercise each newmont option for one share of newmont common stock. at december 31, 2020, there were 558,749 options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $58.64. during 2021, 244,894 options were exercised with a weighted average exercise price of $61.24. no options expired in 2021. at december 31, 2021, there were 313,855 options outstanding and exercisable, at a weighted average exercise price of $56.61 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.6 years.
stock-based compensation activity a summary of the status and activity of non-vested rsus and psus for the year ended december 31, 2021 is as follows:

cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits are classified as part of cash flows from operating activities.
excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for vested rsus, settled psus, and exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock compensation costs for such equity awards. the company recorded $3, $1 and $3 in excess tax benefits for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

note 15 fair value accounting fair value accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3
level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
level 2 quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the black-scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and level 3 prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
the following tables set forth the company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring (at least annually) and nonrecurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy. as required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and are primarily money market securities and u.s. treasury securities.
the company's net trade receivables from provisional metal concentrate sales, which contain an embedded derivative and are subject to final pricing, are valued using quoted market prices based on forward curves for the particular metal. as the contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange, these receivables are classified within level 2
$68 less costs to sell. the assets are classified as non-recurring within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
the company's marketable and other equity securities with readily determinable fair values are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. the fair value of the marketable equity
securities are calculated as the quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by the company.
the company's marketable and other equity securities without readily determinable fair values primarily consists of the company's ownership in mara and warrants in publicly traded companies. the ownership in mara is accounted for under the measurement alternative and is classified as a non-recurring level 3 investment within the fair value hierarchy. warrants are valued using a black-scholes model using quoted market prices in active markets of the underlying securities. as the warrants themselves are not traded on the exchange, these equity securities are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
the company's restricted marketable debt securities are primarily u.s. government issued bonds and international bonds. the company's south american debt securities are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, using published market prices of actively traded securities. the company's north american debt securities are classified within level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. the level 1 debt securities are valued using published market prices of actively traded securities and the level 2 debt securities are valued using pricing models which are based on published market inputs for similar, actively traded securities.
the company's restricted other assets are primarily money market securities with a term longer than three months which are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. as such, they are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration assets and liabilities are determined using discounted cash flow models. the contingent consideration assets and liabilities consist of financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative, but are not designated for hedge accounting under asc 815. the assets and liabilities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. increases in the discount rate will result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration assets and liabilities.

the company completed its annual goodwill impairment testing at december 31, 2021 and concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units. the estimated cash flows used to assess the fair value of each reporting unit were derived from the company's current business plans, which are developed using short-term price forecasts reflective of the current price environment and management's projections for long-term average metal prices. in addition to short and long-term metal price assumptions, other assumptions include estimates of commodity-based and other input costs; capital investment; proven and probable mineral reserve and measured, indicated, and inferred resource estimates, including the timing and cost to develop and produce the reserves;
examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, such items as: (i) a decrease in forecasted production levels if we are unable to realize the mineable reserves, resources and exploration potential at our mining properties and extend the life of mine (ii) increased production or capital costs (iii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions including the market price of metals and changes in the equity and debt markets or country specific factors which could result in higher discount rates, (iv)
negative changes in regulation, legislation, and political environments which could impact our ability to operate in the future. while historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of our reporting units equal to or in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that an impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future.

note 26 commitments and contingencies general estimated losses from contingencies are accrued by a charge to income when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability could be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. legal expenses associated with the contingency are expensed as incurred. if a loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the contingency and estimated range of loss, if determinable, is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss could be incurred.
operating segments the company's operating and reportable segments are identified in note 4. except as noted in this paragraph, all of the company's commitments and contingencies specifically described herein are included in corporate and other. the yanacocha matters relate to the south america reportable segment. the newmont ghana gold and newmont golden ridge matters relate to the africa reportable segment. the mexico tax matter relates to the north america reportable segment.
in early 2015 and again in june 2017, the peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the ministry of the environment ("minam"), issued proposed modifications to water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including yanacocha. these criteria modified the in-
stream water quality criteria pursuant to which yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. in december 2015, minam issued the final regulation that modified the water quality standards.
in february 2017, yanacocha submitted a modification to its previously approved compliance achievement plan to the mining ministry ("minem"). the company did not receive a response or comments to this submission until april 2021
and is now in the process of updating its compliance achievement plan to address these comments. during this interim period, yanacocha separately submitted an environmental impact assessment (eia) modification considering the ongoing operations and the projects to be developed and obtained authorization from minem for such projects.
this authorization included a deadline for compliance with the modified water quality criteria by january 2024.
consequently, part of the company response to minem will include a request for an extension of time for coming into full compliance with the new regulations. in the event that minem does not grant yanacocha an extension of the previously authorized timeline for, and agree to, the updated compliance achievement plan, fines and penalties relating to noncompliance may result beyond january 2024.
the company currently operates five water treatment plants at yanacocha that have been and currently meet all currently applicable water discharge requirements. the company is conducting detailed studies to better estimate water management and other closure activities that will ensure water quality and quantity discharge requirements, including the modifications promulgated by minam, as referenced above, will be met. this also includes performing a comprehensive update to the yanacocha reclamation plan to
address changes in closure activities and estimated closure costs while preserving optionality for potential future projects at yanacocha. these ongoing studies, which will extend beyond the current year, were progressed in the fourth quarter of 2021 as the study team continued to evaluate and revise assumptions and estimated costs of changes to the reclamation plan. while certain estimated costs remain subject to revision, in conjunction with the company's annual 2021 update process for all asset retirement obligations, the company recorded an increase of
$1,597 to the yanacocha reclamation liability based on the progress of the closure studies with a corresponding non-cash charge of $1,554 recorded to reclamation expense related to portions of site operations no longer in production with no expected substantive future economic value and $43 recorded as an increase to the asset retirement cost for producing areas of the operation.
the annual 2021 update related primarily to the expected construction of two water treatment plants, a related increase in the annual operating costs over the extended closure period, and initial consideration of known risks
(including the associated risk that these water treatment estimates could change in the future as more work is completed). however, these and other additional risks and contingencies that are the subject of ongoing studies could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at yanacocha, including, but not limited to, a comprehensive review of our tailings storage facility management, review of yanacocha's water balance and storm water management system, and review of post-closure management costs. the ongoing studies, which are expected to be progressed in 2022, are intended to evaluate and further understand these risks and determine what, if any, additional modification may be required to the reclamation plan, therefore, the company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impacts these risks, if realized, may have on the reclamation obligation as of december 31,
in february 2022, the company completed the acquisition of buenaventura's 43.65% noncontrolling interest in yanacocha (the "yanacocha transaction"). upon close of the yanacocha transaction, the company's ownership interest in yanacocha increased from 51.35% to 95%. refer to note 1 for further information regarding the yanacocha transaction.
entered into a settlement agreement ("settlement agreement") with the water quality control division of the colorado department of public health and environment (the "division") with a mutual objective of resolving issues associated with the new discharge permits issued by the division in january 2021 for the historic carlton tunnel.
the carlton tunnel was a historic tunnel completed in 1941 with the purpose of draining the southern portion of the mining district, subsequently consolidated by cc&v. cc&v has held discharge permits for the carlton tunnel since
1983, but the january 2021 new permits contained new water quality limits. the settlement agreement, once implemented through permit modification applications, would involve installation of interim passive water treatment and ongoing monitoring over the next three years, and then more long-term water treatment installed with target compliance by november 2027. the company is currently considering various interim passive water treatment options, with related studies expected to be progressed in 2022, and based on an evaluation of those options, a remediation liability of $10 was recorded as of december 31, 2021. if one of these passive water treatment options is determined not to be a viable long-term water treatment strategy, cc&v may be required to develop and implement alternative remediation plans for water discharged from the carlton tunnel. depending on the remediation plans that may ultimately be agreed with the division, a material adjustment to the remediation liability may be required.
dawn mining company llc ("dawn") - 58.19% newmont owned midnite mine site and dawn mill site . dawn previously leased an open pit uranium mine, currently inactive, on the spokane indian reservation in the state of washington. the mine site is subject to regulation by agencies of the u.s. department of interior (the bureau of indian affairs and the bureau of land management), as well as the u.s.
2012, the following actions were required of newmont, dawn, the department of the interior and the epa: (i) newmont and dawn would design, construct and implement the cleanup plan selected by the epa in 2006 for the midnite mine site; (ii) newmont and dawn would reimburse the epa for its past costs associated with overseeing the work; (iii)
the department of the interior would contribute a lump sum amount toward past epa costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the midnite mine site; (iv) newmont and dawn would be responsible for all future epa oversight costs and midnite mine site cleanup costs; and (v) newmont would post a surety bond for work at the site.
during 2012, the department of interior contributed its share of past epa costs and future costs related to the cleanup of the midnite mine site in a lump sum payment of $42, which newmont classified as restricted assets with interest on the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. in 2016, newmont completed the remedial design process (with the exception of the new water treatment plant ("wtp") design which was awaiting the approval of the new national pollutant discharge elimination system ("npdes") permit). subsequently, the new npdes permit was received in 2017 and the wtp design commenced in 2018. the epa completed their assessment and approval of the wtp design in 2021 and newmont is in the process of coordinating work with selected contractors for the construction of a new water treatment plant.
the dawn mill site is regulated by the washington department of health and is in the process of being closed.
remediation at the dawn mill site began in 2013. the tailing disposal area 1-4 reclamation earthworks component was completed during 2017 with the embankment erosion protection completed in the second quarter of 2018. the remaining closure activity will consist primarily of addressing groundwater issues and evaporating the remaining balance of process water on site.
the remediation liability for the midnite mine site and dawn mill site is approximately $172 at december 31, 2021.
administrative actions . the peruvian government agency responsible for environmental evaluation and inspection, organismo evaluacion y fiscalizacion ambiental ("oefa"), conducts periodic reviews of the yanacocha site. from 2011
to the fourth quarter of 2021, oefa issued notices of alleged violations of oefa standards to yanacocha and conga relating to past inspections. the water authority that is in charge of supervising the proper water administration has also issued notices of alleged regulatory violations in previous years. the experience with oefa and the water authority is that in the case of a finding of violation, remedial action is often the outcome rather than a significant fine. there are no current alleged oefa violations and the water authority alleged violations range from zero to 10 units, with each unit having a potential fine equivalent to approximately $.001110 based on current exchange rates, with a total potential fine amount for outstanding matters of $- to $0.01. yanacocha is responding to all notices of alleged violations, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome of the agency allegations.
conga project constitutional claim. on october 18, 2012, marco antonio arana zegarra filed a constitutional claim against the ministry of energy and mines and yanacocha requesting the court to order the suspension of the conga project as well as to declare not applicable the october 27, 2010, directorial resolution approving the conga project environmental impact assessment ("eia"). on october 23, 2012, a cajamarca judge dismissed the claims based on formal grounds finding that: (i) plaintiffs had not exhausted previous administrative proceedings; (ii) the directorial resolution approving the conga eia is valid, and was not challenged when issued in the administrative proceedings; (iii) there was inadequate evidence to conclude that the conga project is a threat to the constitutional right of living in an adequate environment; and (iv) the directorial resolution approving the conga project eia does not guarantee that the conga project will proceed, so there was no imminent threat to be addressed by the court. the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of the case. the civil court of the superior court of cajamarca confirmed the above mentioned resolution and the plaintiff presented an appeal. on march 13, 2015, the constitutional court published its ruling stating that the case should be sent back to the first court with an order to formally admit the case and start the judicial process in order to review the claim and the proofs presented by the plaintiff. yanacocha has answered the claim. neither the company nor yanacocha can reasonably predict the outcome of this litigation.
yanacocha tax dispute. in 2000, yanacocha paid buenaventura and minas conga s.r.l. a total of $29 to assume their respective contractual positions in mining concession agreements with chaupiloma dos de cajamarca s.m.r.l. the contractual rights allowed yanacocha the opportunity to conduct exploration on the concessions, but were not a purchase of the concessions. the tax authority alleged that the payments to buenaventura and minas conga s.r.l.
were acquisitions of mining concessions requiring the amortization of the amounts under the peru mining law over the life of the mine. yanacocha expensed the amounts at issue in the initial year since the payments were not for the acquisition of a concession but rather these expenses represented the payment of an intangible and therefore, were amortizable in a single year or proportionally for up to ten years according to income tax law. in 2010, the tax court in peru ruled in favor of yanacocha and the tax authority appealed the issue to the judiciary. the first appellate court confirmed the ruling of the tax court in favor of yanacocha. however, in november 2015, a superior court in peru made an appellate decision overturning the two prior findings in favor of yanacocha. yanacocha appealed the superior court ruling to the peru supreme court. in january 2019, the peru supreme court issued notice that three judges supported the position of the tax authority and two judges supported the position of yanacocha.
because four votes are required for a final decision, an additional judge was selected to issue a decision and the parties conducted oral arguments in april 2019. in february 2020, the additional judge ruled in favor of the tax authority, finalizing a decision of the peru supreme court against yanacocha. as a result of the decision, the company recognized the amount of $29 in 2020. however, yanacocha filed two constitutional actions in 2020, and one legal claim in 2021, objecting to potential excessive interest and duplicity of criteria of up to $50, $73, and
$68, respectively. in march 2021, in one of the constitutional actions, yanacocha's request for an injunction to suspend the collection of interest was denied. the matter was sent back to the tax authority, which issued a resolution with an update of the total amount. yanacocha appealed the tax authority's resolution and, in october
2021, the tax court denied the appeal. as a result, the administrative case went back to the tax authority for collection and the company paid the amount claimed due in october 2021 of approximately $80 and recognized income tax expense of $55 for the year ended december 31, 2021. in january 2022, yanacocha filed a fourth legal claim, objecting to the amount of up to $72. the company continues to pursue the legal actions that remain pending, seeking to recover up to $73 of the total amount paid based on current exchange rates, but it is not possible to fully predict the outcome of such litigation.
in february 2022, the company completed the acquisition of buenaventura's 43.65% noncontrolling interest in yanacocha (the "yanacocha transaction"). upon close of the yanacocha transaction, the company's ownership interest in yanacocha increased from 51.35% to 95%. refer to note 1 for further information regarding the yanacocha transaction.
newmont corporation, as well as newmont canada corporation, and newmont canada fn holdings ulc - 100% newmont owned kirkland lake gold inc. ("kirkland") owns certain mining and mineral rights in northeastern ontario, canada, referred to here as the holt-mcdermott property, on which it suspended operations in april 2020. a subsidiary of the company has a retained royalty obligation ("holt royalty obligation") to royal gold, inc. ("royal gold") for production on the holt-mcdermott property. in august 2020,
on august 16, 2021, international royalty corporation ("irc"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of royal gold, filed an action in the supreme court of nova scotia against newmont corporation, newmont canada corporation, newmont canada fn holdings ulc, and kirkland. irc alleges the kirkland agreement is oppressive to the interests of royal gold under the nova scotia companies act and the canada business corporations act, and that, by entering into the kirkland agreement, newmont breached its contractual obligations to royal gold. irc seeks declaratory relief, and
$350 in alleged royalty payments that it claims newmont expected to pay under the holt royalty obligation, but for the kirkland agreement. the company intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.
fronteer acquired newwest gold corporation ("newwest gold") in september 2007. at the time of that acquisition, nwg investments inc. ("nwg") owned approximately 86% of newwest gold and an individual named jacob safra owned or controlled 100% of nwg. prior to its acquisition of newwest gold, fronteer entered into a june 2007 lock-up agreement with nwg providing that, among other things, nwg would support fronteer's acquisition of newwest gold. at that time, fronteer owned approximately 47% of aurora energy resources inc. ("aurora"), which, among other things, had a uranium exploration project in labrador, canada.
nwg contends that, during the negotiations leading up to the lock-up agreement, fronteer represented to nwg, among other things, that aurora would commence uranium mining in labrador by 2013, that this was a firm date, that aurora faced no current environmental issues in labrador and that aurora's competitors faced delays in commencing uranium mining. nwg further contends that it entered into the lock-up agreement and agreed to support fronteer's acquisition of newwest gold in reliance upon these purported representations. on october 11, 2007, less than three weeks after the fronteer-newwest gold transaction closed, a member of the nunatsiavut assembly introduced a motion calling for the adoption of a moratorium on uranium mining in labrador. on april 8, 2008, the nunatsiavut assembly adopted a three-year moratorium on uranium mining in labrador. nwg contends that fronteer was aware during the negotiations of the nwg/fronteer lock-up agreement that the nunatsiavut assembly planned on adopting this moratorium and that its adoption would preclude aurora from commencing uranium mining by 2013, but fronteer nonetheless fraudulently induced nwg to enter into the lock-up agreement.
on february 26, 2014, nwg filed a lawsuit in ontario superior court of justice against fronteer gold inc., newmont mining corporation, newmont canada holdings ulc, newmont fh b.v. and mark o'dea. the ontario complaint is based upon substantially the same allegations contained in the new york lawsuit with claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. nwg seeks disgorgement of profits since the close of the nwg deal on september 24, 2007 and damages in the amount of c$1,200. newmont, along with other defendants, served the plaintiff with its statement of defense on october 17, 2014. newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.
newmont ghana gold limited and newmont golden ridge limited - 100% newmont owned on december 24, 2018, two individual plaintiffs, who are members of the ghana parliament ("plaintiffs"), filed a writ to invoke the original jurisdiction of the supreme court of ghana. on january 16, 2019, plaintiffs filed the statement of plaintiff's case outlining the details of the plaintiff's case and subsequently served newmont ghana gold limited ("nggl") and newmont golden ridge limited ("ngrl") along with the other named defendants, the attorney general of ghana, the minerals commission of ghana and 33 other mining companies with interests in ghana. the plaintiffs allege that under article 268 of the 1992 constitution of ghana that the mining company defendants are not entitled to carry out any exploitation of minerals or other natural resources in ghana, unless their respective transactions, contracts or concessions are ratified or exempted from ratification by the parliament of ghana.
the writ alleges that any mineral exploitation prior to parliament ratification is unconstitutional. the plaintiffs seek several remedies including: (i) a declaration as to the meaning of constitutional language at issue; (ii) an injunction precluding exploitation of minerals for any mining company without prior parliament ratification; (iii)
a declaration that all revenue as a result of violation of the constitution shall be accounted for and recovered via cash equivalent; and (iv) an order that the attorney general and minerals commission submit all un-ratified mining leases, undertakings or contracts to parliament for ratification. newmont intends to vigorously defend this matter, but cannot reasonably predict the outcome.
goldcorp, inc. - 100% newmont owned shareholder action. on october 28, 2016 and february 14, 2017, separate proposed class actions were commenced in the ontario superior court of justice pursuant to the class proceedings act (ontario) against the company and certain of its current and former officers. both statement of claims alleged common law negligent misrepresentation in goldcorp, inc.'s public disclosure concerning the peñasquito mine and also pleaded an intention to seek leave from the court to proceed with an allegation of statutory misrepresentation pursuant to the secondary market civil liability provisions under the securities act (ontario). by a consent order, the latter lawsuit proceeded, and the former action has been stayed. the active lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of persons who acquired goldcorp inc.'s securities in the secondary market during an alleged class period from october 30, 2014 to august 23, 2016.
an amended complaint was filed in the active lawsuit, which removed the individual defendants, and requested leave of the court to pursue only the statutory cause of action. in july of 2021, plaintiff's counsel filed a motion to discontinue the active lawsuit. the motion was granted by the court in september 2021, discontinuing the active lawsuit, but the company was not provided notice of the court's decision until the first quarter of 2022.
mexico tax matter tax reassessment from mexican tax authority . during 2016, the mexican tax authority issued reassessment notices to several of goldcorp, inc.'s mexican subsidiaries. topics under dispute generally involve transfer pricing, deductibility of mine stripping costs, and gain recognized on certain asset sales. the company has made significant progress in reaching resolution with the mexican tax authority on these matters. in the second quarter of 2019, a number of issues were settled, resulting in a $96 payment, which was fully accrued in the financial statements. in the first quarter of 2020, further settlement was reached for an immaterial amount, with dialogue continuing in an effort to resolve the outstanding reassessment. additionally, the company continues to work through several audits in which observation letters have been received from the mexican tax authority. during the fourth quarter of 2021, a framework to settle a number of years and matters was reached, resulting in a $76 payment, which was fully accrued in the financial statements. full settlement of these years and matters is expected to be reached first half of next year.
other commitments and contingencies as part of its ongoing business and operations, the company and its affiliates are required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit and bank guarantees as financial support for various purposes, including environmental remediation, reclamation, exploration permitting, workers compensation programs and other general corporate purposes. at december 31, 2021 and 2020, there were $1,927 and $1,807, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and bank guarantees. the obligations associated with these instruments are generally related to performance requirements that the company addresses through its ongoing operations. as the specific requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated instrument cancels and/or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. certain of these instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived assets and will remain outstanding until closure. generally, bonding requirements associated with environmental regulation are becoming more restrictive. however, the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable bonding obligations and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements through existing or alternative means, as they arise.
newmont is from time to time involved in various legal proceedings related to its business. except in the above described proceedings, management does not believe that adverse decisions in any pending or threatened proceeding or that amounts that may be required to be paid by reason thereof will have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition or results of operations.
in connection with our investment in galore creek, newmont will owe novagold resources inc. $75 upon the earlier of approval to construct a mine, mill and all related infrastructure for the galore creek project or the initiation of construction of a mine, mill or any related infrastructure. the amount due is non-interest bearing. the decision for an approval and commencement of construction is contingent on the results of a prefeasibility and feasibility study, neither of which have occurred. as such, this amount has not been accrued.

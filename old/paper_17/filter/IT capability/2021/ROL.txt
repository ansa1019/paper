risk factors," of part i of this annual report on form 10-k.
the global spread and unprecedented impact of the covid-19 pandemic ("covid-19") continues to create significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption around the world. in 2020, the pest control industry was designated as "essential" by the department of homeland security. the company has been able to remain operational in every part of the world in which it operates. with the availability of vaccinations, many covid-19 restrictions have been lifted; however, public hesitancy regarding the vaccinations and the continued spread of covid-19, may result in additional restrictions and mandates being imposed. the situation related to covid-19 continues to be complex and dynamic. we cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the pandemic or fully ascertain its impact to
table of contents our future results. we will continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving situation related to covid-19 and may take actions that may alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and communities.
we do not know when, or if, it will become practical to relax or eliminate some or all of these measures entirely as there is no guarantee that covid-19 will be fully contained.the company's consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. the company considered the impact of covid-19 on the assumptions and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial results for the year have been made. these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature but complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the global economic impact of covid-19. the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of results for future years. the severity, magnitude and duration, as well as the economic consequences of covid-19, are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. therefore, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to covid-19 and may change materially in future periods.

revenues revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021 were $2.4 billion, an increase of $263.1 million, or 12.2%, from 2020 revenues of $2.2 billion. comparing 2021 to 2020, residential pest control revenue increased 13%, commercial pest control revenue increased 10% and termite and ancillary services grew 14%. the company's revenue mix for the year ended december 31, 2021 consisted primarily of 46% residential pest control, 34% commercial pest control and 20% termite and ancillary revenues (such as moisture control, insulation, deck and gutter work). the company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% and 7% of total revenues for the years ended december
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. cost of services provided for the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, cost of services provided increased $114.0 million, or 10.9%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2020. the increase was driven by increased people costs and materials and supplies due to the increase in revenues.
additionally, fleet costs increased mainly driven by an increase in fuel costs. sales, general and administrative for the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, sales, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $71.3
million, or 10.9%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2020. the increases were driven by increased people costs mostly due to sales personnel, directly related to our increase in revenues. additionally, sg&a increased due to the accrual related to the potential settlement of the ongoing sec matter of $8.0 million, increased advertising costs and the charitable donation of certain excess personal protection equipment.
depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $5.9 million, or 6.7%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2020. the increase was due to the additional amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions.
table of contents other (income) expense during the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, other income increased $44.0 million primarily due to the company recognizing a gain of $35.7 million compared to a loss of $1.6 million in the prior year. the current year gain is primarily related to multiple sale-leaseback transactions where the company sold and leased back properties that it acquired in 2019 with the clark pest control acquisition. additionally, 2020
included $6.7 million of accelerated stock compensation vesting expense that did not occur in 2021. interest expense, net interest expense, net for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 was $0.8 million and $5.1 million respectively. the decrease was primarily driven by the lower average debt balance in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. income taxes the company's effective tax rate decreased to 26.1% in 2021 compared to 26.5% in 2020.
the rate is lower in the current year due to a net increase in beneficial deductions, driven by an increase in the portion of officer's compensation deductions that were allowable. liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow cash from operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses. the most significant source of cash in our cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from services sold. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services. the company's cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2021, and 2020 were $105.3 million and $98.5 million, respectively.

equivalents cash provided by operating activities the company's operations generated cash of $401.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily from net income of $350.7 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $435.8 million in 2020. during 2021, the company paid the employer-only payroll taxes that were deferred under the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (the "cares" act) which was signed into law on march 27,
2020. the cares act tax deferrals in 2020 and payments in 2021 are the primary drivers for the decline in net cash from operating activities in 2021. the company believes its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities, and available borrowings under its $175 million revolving credit facility and $250 million term loan facility, (which was amended in january 2022 to $300 million) will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future. cash used in investing activities the company used $99.0 million in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 and used $162.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the company invested approximately $27.2 million in capital expenditures during 2021 compared to $23.2 million during 2020. capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology-related projects. the company expects to invest between $25.0 million and $35.0 million in 2022 in capital expenditures.
table of contents cash paid for acquisitions totaled $146.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to $147.6
million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the expenditures for the company's acquisitions were funded through existing cash balances, borrowings on our line of credit, a term loan, and other operating cash flows. the company continues to seek new acquisitions. to offset the use of cash we had approximately $74.4 million related to the sale of assets for the year ended december 31, 2021, mostly related to the clark pest property sale leasebacks, as compared to $7.7 million of asset sales for the year ended december 31, 2020.
cash used in or provided by financing activities the company used $290.2 million in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 and $281.3 million in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020. the company repaid $48.0 million of its outstanding debt balance throughout 2021, net of borrowings, compared to $88.5 million during 2020, net of borrowings. a total of
per share) during the year ended december 31, 2020, including a special dividend paid in december 2020 of $0.09 per share. in 2020, the dividend was reduced due to the uncertainty surrounding the effects of the covid-19 pandemic
("covid-19") to our business.
in 2012, the company's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 5 million shares of the company's common stock. after adjustments for stock splits, the total authorized shares under the share repurchase plan are 16.9
million shares. the company did not purchase shares on the open market during the years ended december 31, 2021,
2020 and 2019. there remain 11.4 million shares authorized to be repurchased under prior board approval. the company repurchased $10.7 million, $8.3 million, and $10.0 million of common stock for the years ended december 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.
the company's $105.3 million of total cash at december 31, 2021 is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. approximately $78.1 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $27.2 million is primarily held in federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") insured non-interest-

1. these amounts represent expected payments under the january 27, 2022 amended credit agreement as detailed in note 4 to the financial statements. 2. these amounts represent expected payments with interest for unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2021. critical accounting estimates the company views critical accounting estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting estimate to be as follows: accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or, for clark pest control only, a non-
affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported
(although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the group captive is subject to a third-party actuary retained by the captive manager, independent from the company. for the high deductible insurance program, the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances.
management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent incidents and claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post incident drug testing, driver training and post-injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited. recent accounting guidance and other policies and estimates see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.

market risk the company maintained an investment portfolio (included in cash and cash equivalents) subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. the company is subject to interest rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $175.0
million revolving credit facility and amended $300.0 million term loan facility that was amended effective january
27, 2022. as of december 31, 2021, the revolving commitment had outstanding borrowings of $107.0 million and the term loan had outstanding borrowings of $48.0 million. additionally, the company maintained $37.2 million in letters of credit. see note 4 to the accompanying financial statements for further details regarding debt. these letters of credit are required by the company's fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the company's self-insured status, to secure various workers' compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage.
the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims. the company is also exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. the company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material impact upon the company's results of operations going forward. for a discussion of the company's activities to manage risks relative to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, see note 11 to the accompanying financial statements.

table of contents definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

table of contents hidden_row critical audit matter the critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
accrued insurance - workers' compensation and vehicle liability as described further in note 1 to the financial statements, the company retains, up to certain policy-specified limits, certain risks related to workers' compensation and vehicle liability.
the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss programs are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. we identified accrued insurance - workers'
compensation and vehicle liability ("accrued insurance") as a critical audit matter.
the principal considerations for our determination that accrued insurance is a critical audit matter are that accrued insurance liability has higher risk of estimation uncertainty due to the loss development factors and inherent assumptions in actuarial methods used in determining the required liability. the estimation uncertainty and complexity of the actuarial methods utilized involved especially subjective auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve an auditor-engaged actuarial specialist.
our audit procedures related to the accrued insurance reserve included the following, among others:
●obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested operating effectiveness of key controls relating to accrued insurance, including, but not limited to, controls that (1)
determine that claims were reported and submitted accurately and timely, (2) determine the underlying data maintained by the company and the third-party administrator used to develop the accrued insurance reserve was complete and accurate, and (3) determine the third-party actuarial report used in developing the accrued insurance reserve was reviewed by the company's management.
●utilized an auditor-engaged specialist in evaluating management's methods and assumptions, including the reasonableness of the selected loss development factors utilized by management to identify indicators of potential bias. we also performed retrospective reviews to evaluate the assumptions utilized by management in the determination of the prior year and current year liability.
●tested the underlying data maintained by the company and the third-party administrator, which was submitted to the company's actuary to develop the accrued insurance reserve, for completeness and accuracy.

table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements years ended december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, rollins, inc. and subsidiaries
1. summary of significant accounting policies business description-rollins, inc. ("rollins," "we," "us," "our," or the "company"), is an international services company headquartered in atlanta, georgia that provides pest and termite control services to both residential and commercial customers through its wholly-owned subsidiaries and independent franchises in the united states, canada, australia, europe, and asia with international franchises in canada, central and south america, the caribbean, europe, the middle east, asia, africa, and australia. the company operates as one reportable segment and the results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer. principles of consolidation-the company's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of rollins, inc. and the company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("gaap"). the company does not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it has an ownership interest of 50% or less. the company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. accordingly, the company has not consolidated any variable interest entity. the company reclassified certain prior period amounts, none of which were material, to conform to the current period presentation. all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. subsequent events-the company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. use of estimates-the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and certain financial statement disclosures. estimates and assumptions are used for, but not limited to, accrued insurance, revenue recognition, right-of-use ("rou") asset and liability valuations, accounts and financing receivable reserves, inventory valuation, employee benefit plans, income tax contingency accruals and valuation allowances, contingency accruals and goodwill and other intangible asset valuations. although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. the company considered the impact of covid-19 on the assumptions and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial results for the year have been made. these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature but complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the global economic impact of covid-19. the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of results for future years. the severity, magnitude and duration, as well as the economic consequences of covid-19, are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict.
therefore, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to covid-19 and may change materially in future periods revenue recognition-the company's revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, each of which are distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. nature of goods and services and performance obligations the company contracts with its customers to provide the following goods and services, each of which is a distinct performance obligation: pest control services -rollins provides pest control services to protect residential and commercial properties from common pests, including rodents and insects. pest control generally consists of assessing a customer's property for conditions that invite pests, tackling current infestations, and stopping the life cycle to prevent future invaders. revenue from pest control services is recognized as services are rendered.
table of contents the company's revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues upon satisfaction of the performance obligation at the time services are performed. for certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, we use estimates as described below. residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. in general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. the company defers recognition of advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. the company classifies discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues. termite control services -rollins provides both traditional and baiting termite protection services. traditional termite protection uses "termidor" liquid treatment and/or dry foam and orkin foam to treat voids and spaces around the property, while baiting termite protection uses baits to disrupt the molting process termites require for growth and offers ongoing protection. revenue from initial termite treatment services is recognized as services are provided. maintenance/monitoring/inspection -in connection with the initial service offerings, rollins provides recurring maintenance, monitoring or inspection services to help protect consumers' property from any future sign of termite activities after the original treatment. this recurring service is a service-type warranty under asc 606
as it is routinely sold and purchased separately from the initial treatment services and is typically purchased or renewed annually. termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the transfer of control of the individual units of accounting. at the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring performance obligation. this portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue that depicts the company's performance in transferring control of the service. the allocation of the transaction price to the two deliverables is based on the relative stand-alone selling price. there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that depicts the company's performance in transferring control of the service. revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term that depicts the company's performance in transferring control of the service; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. for outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred
(including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date, and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. as the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. the company accrues for noticed claims. the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses. miscellaneous services -in certain agreements with customers, rollins may offer other miscellaneous services, including restroom cleaning (eliminating foul odors, grease and grime which could attract pests) and training (seminars covering good manufacturing practices and product stewardship). revenue from miscellaneous services is recognized when services are provided. products -depending on customer demand, rollins may separately sell pest control and/or termite protection products, such as traps. revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of the asset. equipment rental (or lease) -depending on customer demand, rollins may lease certain pest control and/or termite protection equipment. revenues from equipment rentals are recognized over the period of the rental/lease. revenues from equipment rentals represent less than 1.0% of the company's revenues for each reported period. contract balances timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. we record unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to billing. unearned revenue mainly relates to the company's termite baiting offering, conventional renewals, and year-in-advance pest control services for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the
table of contents product or service. for multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. refer to note 3 - revenue for further information, including changes in unearned revenue for the year.
the company extends terms to certain customers on higher dollar termite and ancillary work, as well as to certain franchisees for initial funding on the sale of franchises. these financed receivables are segregated from our trade receivables. the allowance for expected credit losses reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. we determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. see note 5 - allowance for credit losses for further information.
payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. in instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. the primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing.
practical expedients and exemptions we generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. these costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.
we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. all revenues are reported net of sales taxes.
the company's international operations accounted for approximately %, %, and % of revenues for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively.
allowance for expected credit losses- the company maintains an allowance for expected credit losses based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable. management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectability of accounts receivable. substantially all of the company's receivables are due from pest control and termite services in the united states and selected international locations. the company's allowance for expected credit losses is determined using a combination of factors. the company's established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. provisions for expected credit losses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. accounts are written-off against the allowance for expected credit losses when the company determines that amounts are uncollectible, and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery.
therefore, the provision for expected credit losses can fluctuate significantly from period to period. there were no large recoveries in 2021, 2020, and 2019. we record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. if circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.
advertising-advertising costs are charged to sales, general and administrative expense during the year in which they are incurred.
cash and cash equivalents- the company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
cash held in foreign bank accounts    $  78,102    $  71,330    $  74,094
table of contents the company's $ million of total cash at december 31, 2021, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions.
approximately $ million is held in cash accounts at international banking institutions and the remaining $ million is primarily held in federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times may exceed federally insured amounts.
the company's international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as potential acquisitions of unrelated companies. repatriation of cash from the company's foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the company's current business plan.
rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business for the foreseeable future.
marketable securities- from time to time, the company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial institutions. the company's investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than
"investment grade" by national rating services.
management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. debt securities are classified as available-for-sale because the company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity. available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in earnings.
the company had no marketable securities other than those held in the defined benefit pension plan and the non-
qualified deferred compensation plan at december 31, 2021 and 2020. see note 14 for further details.
materials and supplies- materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method.
other current assets - other current assets include prepaids and an international bond investment. refer to note 7, fair value measurement.
income taxes-the company provides for income taxes based on fasb asc topic 740 "income taxes", which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. the company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. the company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold.
equipment and property- equipment and property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. annual provisions for depreciation are computed using the following asset lives: buildings, 10 to ; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, 2 to . expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. the cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. the annual provisions for depreciation, below, have been reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the line item entitled depreciation and amortization.
certain internal-use software and systems development costs are capitalized. accordingly, the specific identified costs incurred to develop and obtain software, which is intended for internal use, are not capitalized until the software is put into use. management, with the relevant authority, authorizes and commits to funding a software project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. costs incurred during a software development's discovery phase and post-integration stage, are expensed as incurred. application development activities that are eligible for capitalization include software design and configuration, development of interfaces, coding, testing and installation. capitalized internal-use software and systems
table of contents costs are subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis over a threeto seven yearperiod after project completion and when the related software or system is ready for intended use. impairment of long-lived assets -in accordance with the fasb asc topic 360, "property, plant and equipment", the company's long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. we periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including customer contracts and assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition. goodwill and other intangible assets- in accordance with the fasb asc topic 350,
"intangibles - goodwill and other", the company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. the company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives or goodwill.
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. such conditions mayinclude an economic downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. the company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the company level. such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the company) with its carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value, the company recognizes a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. the company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. the company recognizes an impairment charge if the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. the company completed its most recent annual impairment analysis as of september 30, 2021. based upon the results of these analyses, the company has concluded that noimpairment of its goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated. other assets -other assets is mostly comprised of deferred compensations assets. refer to note 14, employee benefit plans. accrued insurance- the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or, for clark pest control only, a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the group captive is subject to a third-party actuary retained by the captive manager, independent from the company. for the high deductible insurance program, the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent incidents and claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post incident drug testing, driver training and post-
injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited. accrual for termite contracts-the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company's business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. an accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
table of contents other current liabilities - other current liabilities are mostly comprised of the current portion of acquisition holdback and earnout liabilities (see note 8), deferred compensation liabilities (see note 14) and taxes payable.
other long-term accrued liabilities - other long-term accrued liabilities include long-term balances for deferred compensation and acquisition and holdback liabilities, and the long-term portion of termite contracts.
contingency accruals-the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the fasb asc topic 450 "contingencies," management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations.
contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
earnings per share-the fasb asc topic 260-10 "earnings per share-overall," requires a basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share presentation. further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.
the company has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered participating securities. see note 15 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.
the basic and diluted calculations are the same as we have stock options or other potentially dilutive instruments outstanding. basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods.
a reconciliation of weighted average shares outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to restricted shares of common stock (participating securities) is as follows (in thousands except per share data).
undistributed earnings for the period    $   142,031    $   100,337    $    49,512
allocation of undistributed earnings:
translation of foreign currencies-assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than u.s. dollars are translated into u.s. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.
table of contents the resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign currency are included in the earnings of the current period. stock-based compensation- the company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the fasb asc topic 718 " compensation - stock compensation." time lapse restricted shares (tlrss) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the company's employee stock incentive plan. tlrss provide for the issuance of a share of the company's common stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. outstanding tlrss vest in 20percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six yearsfrom the date of grant. during these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. the agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed. the fair value of these awards is recognized as compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over six years. comprehensive income (loss)-other comprehensive income (loss) results from foreign currency translations, minimum pension liability adjustments and cash flow hedge of interest rate risks.
franchising program- the company has franchise programs through orkin, critter control and its australian subsidiaries. we had a total of 135, 128and 134domestic franchise agreements as of december 31, 2021, 2020 and
2019, respectively. transactions with our franchises involve sales of territories and customer contracts to establish new franchises and the payment of initial franchise fees and royalties by franchisees. the territories, customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically paid for by a combination of cash and notes. combined domestic and international revenues from orkin, critter control and australia franchises were $ 15.5million for the year ended december 31, 2021 and $ 15.2million and $ 17.1million for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. total franchising revenues were less than 1.0% of the company's annual revenues. right to access intellectual property (franchise)- the right to access orkin's, critter control's and our australia franchisors'
intellectual property is an essential part of our franchise agreements. these agreements provide the franchisee a license to use the brand name and trademark when advertising and selling services to end customers in their normal course of business. orkin and critter control franchise agreements contain a clause allowing the respective franchisor to purchase certain assets of the franchisee at the conclusion of their franchise agreement or upon termination. this is only an option for the franchisor to re-purchase the assets selected by the franchisor and is not a performance obligation or a form of consideration. recent accounting guidance recently adopted accounting standards in october 2021, the fasb issued asu 2021-08, "business combinations (topic 805) - accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers." the amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2022 with early adoption permitted. the company adopted this asu during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. in december 2019, the fasb issued asu no. 2019 12 "income taxes (topic 740): simplifying the accounting for income taxes.' the standard eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period (1) exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation (2) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments and (3) exceptions in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. the asu also is designed to improve financial statement preparers' application of income tax-related guidance and simplify gaap for (1) franchise taxes that are partially based on income, (2) transactions with a government that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, (3) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax, and (4) enacted changes in tax laws in interim
table of contents periods. the standard in this update is effective for the company's financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning in 2021. the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements. in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, "financial instruments - credit losses (asc 326):
measurement of credit losses on financial instruments." the updated accounting guidance requires changes to the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments not accounted for at fair value through net income. the company adopted asu 2016-13 effective january 1, 2020 and recognized the decrease in the allowance for expected credit losses, net of tax, as a $ 2.5million increase to beginning retained earnings. recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2022 or later in november 2021, the fasb issued asu 2021-10, "government assistance
(topic 832) - disclosures by business entities about government assistance." the amendments in this update require disclosures about transactions with a government that have been accounted for by analogizing to a grant or contribution accounting model to increase transparency about (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for the transactions, and (3) the effect of the transactions on an entity's financial statements. the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2021. the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.

goodwill from acquisitions represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. the factors contributing to the amount of goodwill are based on strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized. for the year ended december 31, 2021, $ million of goodwill was added related to the acquisitions noted above. the recognized goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. the purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary until the company obtains final information regarding these fair values.
sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. no sales to an individual customer or in a country other than the united states accounted for 10% or more of the sales for the periods listed on the following table.
revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers are located, was as follows:
united states      $  2,240,226    $  2,006,368    $  1,862,698

deferred revenue recognized for the year ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ million and $ million, respectively. changes in unearned revenue were as follows:
recognition of unearned revenue                        -187,347       -173,226
revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized ("contracted not recognized revenue"), which includes both unearned revenue and revenue that will be billed and recognized in future periods. the company has no material contracted not recognized revenue as of december 31, 2021 or december 31, 2020.

4. debt in april 2019, the company entered into a credit agreement with truist bank, (formerly known as suntrust bank) and bank of america, n.a. (the "credit agreement") for an unsecured revolving commitment of up to $
175.0million, which includes a $ 75.0million letter of credit subfacility and a $ 25.0million swingline subfacility
(the "revolving commitment") and an unsecured variable rate $ 250.0million term loan (the "term loan"). both the revolving commitment and the term loan (the "credit facility") have five-yeardurations commencing on april 29, 2019
and ending april 29, 2024. in addition, the agreement has provisions to extend the
table of contents duration beyond the revolving commitment termination date as well as optional prepayment rights at any time and from time to time to prepay any borrowing, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. as of december 31,
2021, the revolving commitment had outstanding borrowings of $ 107.0million and the term loan had outstanding borrowings of $ 48.0million. as of december 31, 2020, there were $ 203.0million in aggregate outstanding borrowings. the $ 155.0million outstanding borrowings value approximated the fair value at december 31, 2021 based upon interest rates available to the company as evidenced by debt of other companies with similar credit characteristics. our effective interest rate on the debt outstanding as of december 31, 2021 was 0.85%. the effective interest rate is comprised of the 1-month libor plus a margin of 75.0basis points as determined by our leverage ratio calculation. the company has partially prepaid the term loan ahead of the amortization schedule and therefore, as of december 31, 2021, the only required payment was a balloon payment of $ 48.0million in april 2024.
the company maintains approximately $ 37.2million in letters of credit. these letters of credit are required by the company's fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the company's self-insured status, to secure various workers' compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims. on january 27, 2022, the company entered into an amendment (the "amendment") to the credit agreement with truist bank and bank of america, n.a whereby additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $ 252.0million were advanced to the company. the amendment also replaced libor as the benchmark interest rate for borrowings with the bloomberg short-term bank yield index rate ("bsby") and reset the amortization schedule for all term loans under the credit agreement. the maturity of all loans made under the credit agreement prior to the amendment remains unchanged at april 29, 2024
and all other terms of the credit agreement remain unchanged in all material respects. subsequent to year end, in conjunction with this amendment, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all term loans under the credit agreement is $ 300.0million (consisting of an outstanding principal balance of the initial term loan in the amount of $ 48.0million and the additional $ 252.0million term loan borrowing made). in order to comply with applicable debt covenants, the company is required to maintain at all times a leverage ratio of not greater than 3.00:1.00.
the leverage ratio is calculated as of the last day of the fiscal quarter most recently ended. the company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at december 31, 2021 and expects to maintain compliance throughout
5. allowance for credit losses the company is exposed to credit losses primarily related to accounts receivables and financed receivables derived from customer services revenue. to reduce credit risk for residential pest control accounts receivable, we promote enrollment in our auto-pay programs. in general, we may suspend future services for customers with past due balances. the company's credit risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising rollins' customer base and dispersion across many different geographical regions. the company manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. the company's established credit evaluation and monitoring procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. the credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on an assessment of the individual's beacon/credit bureau score. rollins requires a potential obligor to have good credit worthiness with low risk before entering into a contract. depending upon the individual's credit score, the company may accept with 100% financing or require a significant down payment or turn down the contract. delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. financing receivables include installment receivable amounts, some of which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates. the company's allowances for credit losses for trade accounts receivable and financed receivables are developed using historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and a review of the current status of customers'
receivables. the company's receivable pools are classified between residential customers, commercial customers, large commercial customers, and financed receivables. accounts are written-off against the allowance for credit losses when the company determines that amounts are uncollectible, and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. the company
table of contents stops accruing interest to these receivables when they are deemed uncollectible. below is a roll forward of the company's allowance for credit losses for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020.

total financing receivables, net were $ million and $ million at december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, respectively. financing receivables are generally charged-off when deemed uncollectable or when have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment. the company's charge-off policy has been consistently applied during the periods reported. management considers the charge-off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for expected credit losses. gross charge-offs as a percentage of average financing receivables were % and
% for the twelve months ended december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, respectively. due to the low percentage of charge-off receivables and the high creditworthiness of the potential obligors, the rollins, inc. financing receivables portfolio has a low credit risk.
the company offers same-as-cash financing to some customers based on their creditworthiness. interest is not recognized until the 91st day at which time it is calculated retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. in certain circumstances, such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest when they reach past due. as of december 31, 2021, there was account that was greater than past due, which has been fully reserved.
included in financing receivables are notes receivable from franchise owners. the majority of these notes are low risk as the repurchase of these franchises is guaranteed by the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, orkin systems, llc, and the repurchase price of the franchise is currently estimated and has historically been well above the receivable due from the franchise owner. also included in notes receivables are franchise notes from other brands which are not guaranteed and do not have the same historical valuation.
the carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates for these types of contracts. long-term installment receivables, net were $ million and $ million at december 31, 2021

7. leases the company leases certain buildings, vehicles, and equipment in order to reduce the risk associated with ownership. the company elected the practical expedient approach permitted under asc topic 842, "leases" not to include short-term leases with a duration of 12 months or less on the balance sheet. as of december 31, 2021 and
2020, all leases were classified as operating leases. building leases generally carry terms of 5 to 10 yearswith annual rent escalations at fixed amounts per the lease. vehicle leases generally carry a fixed term of one yearwith renewal options to extend the lease on a monthly basis resulting in lease terms up to 7 yearsdepending on the class of vehicle. the exercise of renewal options is at the company's sole discretion. it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise the renewal options on its vehicle leases. the measurement of right-of-use assets and liabilities for vehicle leases includes the
table of contents fixed payments associated with such renewal periods. we separate lease and non-lease components of contracts. our lease agreements do not contain any material variable payments, residual value guarantees, early termination penalties or restrictive covenants.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, the company completed multiple sale-leaseback transactions where it sold of its properties related to the clark pest control acquisition for gross proceeds of $ million and a pre-tax gain of $ million, which is included in other (income) expense, net on the income statement. these leases are classified as operating leases with terms of 7 to .
the company uses the rate implicit in the lease when available; however, most of our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. accordingly, we estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at lease commencement.

million for vehicle leases. as of december 31, 2021, the company had additional future obligations of $ million for leases that had not yet commenced.
8. fair value measurement the company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, financed and notes receivable, accounts payable, other short-term liabilities, and debt. the carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their respective fair values. the company also has derivative instruments as discussed in note 11 and financial instruments related to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed in note 14.
table of contents the fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value.
level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. level 2
refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, the company invested $ million of unrestricted cash in international bonds, a level 2 asset under the fair value hierarchy. the investment is recorded in other current assets. the fair market values of the bonds approximate their amortized costs.
at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the company had $ million and $ million of acquisition holdback and earnout liabilities with the former owners of acquired companies. acquisition earnouts are generally earned by achieving certain levels of revenue growth while maintaining certain profit margins. the earnout liabilities are discounted to reflect the expected probability of payout, and both earnout and holdback liabilities are discounted to their net present value on the company's books and are considered level 3 liabilities.
the table below presents a summary of the changes in fair value for these liabilities.
acquisition holdback and earnout liabilities at    $   49,132

10. customer contracts, tradenames and trademarks, and other intangible assets customer contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. in accordance with the fasb asc topic 350 "intangibles - goodwill and other", the expected lives of customer contracts were analyzed, and it was determined that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of to dependent upon customer type.
the carrying amount and accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:
customer contracts                $   551,277    $   475,494
customer contracts, net           $   325,929    $   298,949

11. derivative instruments and hedging activities risk management objective of using derivatives the company is exposed to certain interest rate risks on our outstanding debt and foreign currency risks arising from our international business operations and global economic conditions. the company enters into certain derivative financial instruments to lock in certain interest rates, as well as to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of its functional currency, the u.s. dollar.
cash flow hedges of interest rate risk the company uses interest rate swap arrangements to manage or hedge its interest rate risk. notwithstanding the terms of the swaps, the company is ultimately obligated for all amounts due and payable under the credit facility.
the company does not use interest rate swaps for speculative or trading purposes.
on june 19, 2019, the company entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap for an aggregate notional amount of $ million in order to hedge a portion of the company's floating rate indebtedness under the credit facility. the company designated the swap as a cash flow hedge. the swap requires the company to pay a fixed rate of % per annum on the notional amount. the cash flows from the swap began june 30, 2019 and ended on december 31, 2021. realized gains and losses in connection with each required interest payment are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") to interest expense during the period of the cash flows. during 2021 and 2020, $
million and $ million was reclassified into interest expense. during 2019, $ million was recorded as interest income, partially offsetting the floating rate interest expense on our credit facility.
hedges of foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against its functional currency, the us dollar. we use foreign currency derivatives, specifically foreign currency forward contracts ("fx forwards"), to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the usd-cad and aud-usd exchange rates. fx forwards involve fixing the foreign currency exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. the fx forwards are typically settled in us dollars for their fair value at or close to their settlement date. we do not currently designate any of these fx forwards under hedge accounting, but rather reflect the changes in fair value immediately in earnings. we do not use such instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but rather use them to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates. changes in the fair value of fx forwards are recorded in other income/expense and were equal to net losses of $ million for each of the twelve months ended december 31, 2021 and
2020. the fair values of the company's fx forwards were recorded in other current liabilities as net obligations of
as of december 31, 2020, the company had the following outstanding fx forwards (in thousands except for number of instruments):

as of december 31, 2021, the company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately $ million, which will be available to offset future taxable income. if not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2022 and 2032. management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $ million of foreign net operating losses before they expire and has included a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. the valuation allowance increased by $ million due to foreign net operating losses. the company has a foreign tax credit carryforward of $ million which if not fully utilized will expire in 2026.
earnings from continuing operations before income tax included foreign income of $ million in 2021, $ million in
2020 and $ million in 2019. the company's international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisition of unrelated companies. repatriation of cash from the company's international subsidiaries is not a part of the company's current business plan.
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2021 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $ million. a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
unrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $    844    $   844
of year additions for tax positions of prior             174          -
years unrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $  1,018    $   844
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. in addition, the company has subsidiaries in various state and international jurisdictions that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2013 through 2019. with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to u.s. federal, state and local, or non-u.s., income tax examinations for years prior to 2013.
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next 12 months.
13. commitments and contingencies in the normal course of business, the company and its subsidiaries are involved in, and will continue to be involved in, various claims, arbitrations, contractual disputes, investigations, and regulatory and litigation matters relating to, and arising out of, our businesses and our operations. these matters may involve, but are not limited to, allegations that our services or vehicles caused damage or injury, claims that our services did not achieve the desired results, claims related to acquisitions and allegations by federal, state or local authorities of violations of regulations or statutes. in addition, we are parties to employment-related cases and claims from time to time, which may include claims on a representative or class action basis alleging wage and hour law violations. we are also involved from time to time in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. we evaluate pending and threatened claims and establish loss contingency reserves based upon outcomes we currently believe to be probable and reasonably estimable. as we previously disclosed, the sec is conducting an investigation (the "sec investigation"). we believe the sec investigation is primarily focused on how the company established accruals and reserves at period-ends for periods beginning january
1, 2016 through december 31, 2018 and the impact of those accruals and reserves on reported earnings per share, specifically, in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017. the company is in ongoing discussions with the sec staff regarding a potential resolution of the sec investigation. in light of the foregoing, in accordance with the accounting guidance in asc 450, "contingencies," the company recorded an accrual for $
8.0million related to the sec investigation in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, which is reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position. the ultimate amount of any liability related to the potential resolution of the sec investigation could be different from the $ 8.0million accrued as of december 31, 2021. the company will continue to cooperate with the sec in working towards a final resolution of the sec investigation. as we previously reported during the third quarter of 2021, the audit committee of the company's board of directors initiated a related, supplemental internal investigation. this supplemental investigation was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021. the company believes that no restatement of its prior period financial statements will be required as a result of the sec investigation or matters related thereto. management does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, regulatory action or investigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year. 14. employee benefit plans defined benefit pension plans the company has sponsored noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans covering employees meeting certain age and service requirements, the most significant of which was the rollins, inc. plan, which was terminated in 2018. the company funds its plans with at least the minimum amount required by erisa.
table of contents rollins, inc. retirement income plan, (the "rollins, inc. plan") in 2005, the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins, inc. plan, although the company remained obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005. in september 2019, the company settled this fully-funded pension plan through a combination of lump sum payments to participants, payments to the pension benefit guaranty corporation, and the purchase of a group annuity contract. with the completed funding of the plan payout settlements, the company had approximately $
31.8million of pension assets remaining. the remaining assets were the result of the funded status of the rollins, inc. plan, higher take rate of lump sum payment election by participants and optimal pricing of the group annuity contract. the company evaluated the erisa allowable opportunities for utilization of the excess pension assets, including funding other employee benefits. the company used $ 18.0million during the year ended december 31, 2020
and $ 11.0million during the year ended december 31, 2019 of the $ 31.8million to fund its 401(k) match obligation.
as of december 31, 2020, the company had approximately $ 1.2million remaining of benefit plan assets related to the rollins, inc. plan. during 2021 all remaining assets were reverted to the company per erisa regulations. the company paid 46.1% of taxes upon reversion, which included 20% of excise tax. waltham services, llc hourly employee pension plan (the "waltham plan") the company continues to sponsor the waltham plan, which covers less than
85participants as of december 31, 2021. the waltham plan was amended, effective september 1, 2018, to freeze future benefit accruals for all participants. the company accounts for all defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 "compensation retirement benefits," and engages an outside actuary to calculate obligations and costs. with the assistance of the actuary, the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis, including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary. as of december 31, 2021, the waltham plan had assets of $
2.2million, a projected liability of $ 2.9million and an unfunded status of $ 0.7million. at december 31, 2021 the plan's assets were comprised of listed common stocks and u.s government and corporate securities and are classified as level 1 and level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. defined contribution 401(k) savings plan the company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan ("the plan") that is available to a majority of the company's full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following completion of three monthsof service. the plan is available to non-full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one yearof service upon completion of 1,000 hoursin that year. the plan provides for a matching contribution of onedollar ($1.00) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions to the plan that do not exceed 3percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime, and bonuses) and fiftycents ($0.50) for each one dollar ($1.00)
of a participant's contributions to the plan over the initial 3percent that do not exceed 6percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). the charge to expense for the company match was approximately $ 25.7million, $ 27.4million and $ 25.5million for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020
and 2019, respectively. at december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 approximately, 28.7%, 34.9%, and 30.8%, respectively, of the plan assets consisted of rollins, inc. common stock. total administrative fees paid by the company for the plan were less than $ 0.1million for each of the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. nonqualified deferred compensation plan the deferred compensation plan provides that participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 85% of their annual bonus with respect to any given plan year, subject to a $ 2thousand per plan year minimum. the company may make discretionary contributions to participant accounts but has not done so since 2011. accounts will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain "measurement funds." account values are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and company credits had been converted into shares or other ownership units of selected measurement funds by purchasing
(or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the current purchase price of the relevant measurement fund at the time of the participant's selection. deferred compensation plan benefits are unsecured general obligations of the company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with the company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. the company has established a "rabbi trust," which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to indirectly fund any obligations under the deferred compensation plan. to the extent that the company's obligations under the deferred compensation plan exceed assets available under the trust, the company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability under the deferred compensation plan.
table of contents generally, the deferred compensation plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participant's death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment (a "termination event").
however, for any deferrals of salary and bonus (but not company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is prior to a termination event. generally, the deferred compensation plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions under the deferred compensation plan in installments or lump-sum payments.
at december 31, 2021, the deferred compensation plan had life insurance policies with a net face value of $ million compared to policies with a face value of $ million at december 31, 2020. the cash surrender value of these life insurance policies was worth $ million and $ million at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. these policies are valued using the nav practical expedient.

item 7.     management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
presentation this discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document. discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons of 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 on our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2020. the following discussion (as well as other discussions in this document) contains forward-looking statements. please see "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements" for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.
the company rollins, inc. ("rollins," "we," "us," "our," or the "company"), is an international services company headquartered in atlanta, georgia that provides pest and termite control services to both residential and commercial customers through its wholly-owned subsidiaries and independent franchises in the united states, canada, australia, europe, and asia with international franchises in canada, central and south america, the caribbean, europe, the middle east, asia, africa, and australia. our pest and termite control services are performed pursuant to terms of contracts that specify the pricing arrangement with the customer. the company operates as one reportable segment and the results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer.
2021 marked the company's 24th consecutive year of increased revenues. revenues for the year rose 12.2% percent to $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year. income before income taxes increased 33.9% to $474.8 million compared to $354.7 million the prior year. net income increased 34.5% to $350.7 million, with earnings per diluted share of $0.71 compared to $260.8 million, or $0.53 per diluted share for the prior year. the company has continued to increase dividends to investors with $0.42 per diluted share paid in 2021 as compared to $0.33 per diluted share for the prior year, resulting in a 27% increase in dividends per share. in 2020, the dividend was reduced due to the uncertainty surrounding the effects of the covid-19 pandemic ("covid-19") to our business.
cybersecurity incident in october 2021, a third-party information technology managed service provider ("msp") of the company was the target of a cybersecurity incident (the "incident") resulting in the shutdown of the company's third-party customer relationship management software used by certain of our subsidiaries whose aggregate annual revenues comprise less than 11% of our total revenues. upon notice of the incident from the msp, the company immediately initiated its incident response protocols. there was no known material day-to-day impact to our ability to provide normal service to customers and there was no known indication that the information of our customers or employees was compromised as a result of the incident. the incident did not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition; however, we may continue to be the target of further cybersecurity incidents that could possibly have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operation or financial condition. more information about our cybersecurity risks is discussed under item 1a., "risk factors," of part i of this annual report on form 10-k.
the global spread and unprecedented impact of the covid-19 pandemic ("covid-19") continues to create significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption around the world. in 2020, the pest control industry was designated as "essential" by the department of homeland security. the company has been able to remain operational in every part of the world in which it operates. with the availability of vaccinations, many covid-19 restrictions have been lifted; however, public hesitancy regarding the vaccinations and the continued spread of covid-19, may result in additional restrictions and mandates being imposed. the situation related to covid-19 continues to be complex and dynamic. we cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the pandemic or fully ascertain its impact to
our future results. we will continue to actively monitor the rapidly evolving situation related to covid-19 and may take actions that may alter our operations, including those that may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and communities. we do not know when, or if, it will become practical to relax or eliminate some or all of these measures entirely as there is no guarantee that covid-19 will be fully contained.
the company's consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. the company considered the impact of covid-19 on the assumptions and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the company's financial results for the year have been made. these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature but complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the global economic impact of covid-19. the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of results for future years. the severity, magnitude and duration, as well as the economic consequences of covid-19, are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. therefore, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to covid-19 and may change materially in future periods.

revenues revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021 were $2.4 billion, an increase of $263.1 million, or 12.2%, from 2020 revenues of $2.2 billion. comparing 2021 to 2020, residential pest control revenue increased 13%, commercial pest control revenue increased 10% and termite and ancillary services grew 14%. the company's revenue mix for the year ended december 31, 2021 consisted primarily of 46% residential pest control, 34% commercial pest control and 20% termite and ancillary revenues (such as moisture control, insulation, deck and gutter work). the company's foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% and 7% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
cost of services provided for the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, cost of services provided increased $114.0 million, or 10.9%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2020. the increase was driven by increased people costs and materials and supplies due to the increase in revenues. additionally, fleet costs increased mainly driven by an increase in fuel costs.
sales, general and administrative for the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, sales, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased $71.3 million, or 10.9%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2020. the increases were driven by increased people costs mostly due to sales personnel, directly related to our increase in revenues. additionally, sg&a increased due to the accrual related to the potential settlement of the ongoing sec matter of $8.0 million, increased advertising costs and the charitable donation of certain excess personal protection equipment.
depreciation and amortization for the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, depreciation and amortization increased $5.9 million, or 6.7%, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2020. the increase was due to the additional amortization of customer contracts from several acquisitions.
other (income) expense during the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, other income increased $44.0 million primarily due to the company recognizing a gain of $35.7 million compared to a loss of $1.6 million in the prior year. the current year gain is primarily related to multiple sale-leaseback transactions where the company sold and leased back properties that it acquired in 2019 with the clark pest control acquisition. additionally, 2020 included $6.7 million of accelerated stock compensation vesting expense that did not occur in 2021.
interest expense, net interest expense, net for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 was $0.8 million and $5.1 million respectively. the decrease was primarily driven by the lower average debt balance in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow cash from operating activities is the principal source of cash generation for our businesses.
the most significant source of cash in our cash flow from operations is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from services sold. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of material and services.

cash provided by operating activities the company's operations generated cash of $401.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily from net income of $350.7 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $435.8 million in 2020. during 2021, the company paid the employer-only payroll taxes that were deferred under the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (the "cares" act) which was signed into law on march 27, 2020. the cares act tax deferrals in 2020 and payments in 2021 are the primary drivers for the decline in net cash from operating activities in 2021. the company believes its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities, and available borrowings under its $175 million revolving credit facility and $250 million term loan facility, (which was amended in january 2022 to $300 million) will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future.
cash used in investing activities the company used $99.0 million in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 and used $162.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the company invested approximately $27.2 million in capital expenditures during 2021 compared to $23.2 million during 2020. capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology-related projects. the company expects to invest between $25.0 million and $35.0 million in 2022 in capital expenditures.
cash paid for acquisitions totaled $146.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to $147.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the expenditures for the company's acquisitions were funded through existing cash balances, borrowings on our line of credit, a term loan, and other operating cash flows. the company continues to seek new acquisitions. to offset the use of cash we had approximately $74.4 million related to the sale of assets for the year ended december 31, 2021, mostly related to the clark pest property sale leasebacks, as compared to $7.7 million of asset sales for the year ended december 31, 2020.
cash used in or provided by financing activities the company used $290.2 million in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2021 and $281.3 million in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2020. the company repaid $48.0 million of its outstanding debt balance throughout 2021, net of borrowings, compared to $88.5 million during 2020, net of borrowings. a total of $208.7 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.42 per share) during the year ended december 31, 2021 including a special dividend paid in december 2021 of $0.08 per share, compared to $160.5 million in cash dividends paid ($0.33 per share) during the year ended december 31, 2020, including a special dividend paid in december 2020 of $0.09 per share. in 2020, the dividend was reduced due to the uncertainty surrounding the effects of the covid-19 pandemic ("covid-19") to our business.
in 2012, the company's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 5 million shares of the company's common stock. after adjustments for stock splits, the total authorized shares under the share repurchase plan are 16.9 million shares. the company did not purchase shares on the open market during the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. there remain 11.4 million shares authorized to be repurchased under prior board approval. the company repurchased $10.7 million, $8.3 million, and $10.0 million of common stock for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.
the company's $105.3 million of total cash at december 31, 2021 is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. approximately $78.1 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $27.2 million is primarily held in federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times may exceed federally insured amounts.
the company's international business is expanding, and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. repatriation of cash from the company's international subsidiaries is not a part of the company's current business plan.
rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business. in order to comply with applicable debt covenants, the company is required to maintain at all times a leverage ratio of not greater than 3.00:1.00. the leverage ratio is calculated as of the last day of the fiscal quarter most recently ended. the company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at december 31, 2021 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2022.

1.these amounts represent expected payments under the january 27, 2022 amended credit agreement as detailed in note 4 to the financial statements.
2.these amounts represent expected payments with interest for unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2021.
critical accounting estimates the company views critical accounting estimates to be those that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting estimate to be as follows:
accrued insurance-the company retains, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation and auto liability. risks are managed through either high deductible insurance or, for clark pest control only, a non-affiliated group captive insurance member arrangement. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the group captive is subject to a third-party actuary retained by the captive manager, independent from the company. for the high deductible insurance program, the company contracts with an independent third-party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with management's knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. management's judgment is inherently subjective as a number of factors are outside management's knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in safety and risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce and prevent incidents and claims. initiatives that have been implemented include required pre-employment screening and ongoing motor vehicle record review for all drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, pre-hire, random and post incident drug testing, driver training and post-injury nurse triage for work-related injuries. the accruals and reserves we hold are based on estimates that involve a degree of judgment and are inherently variable and could be overestimated or insufficient. if actual claims exceed our estimates, our operating results could be materially affected, and our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future costs may be limited.
recent accounting guidance and other policies and estimates see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k) for further discussion.

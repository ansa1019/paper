item 1a.risk factors a description of factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results is provided below.
risk factors summary the following summarizes the most material risks that make an investment in our securities risky or speculative. if any of the following risks occur or persist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed and the price of our common stock could significantly decline.
•shortages or disruption in the supply chain could affect our ability to timely process components for our products;
•travel bans or quarantine requirements could delay our ability to install or service our products;
•increased costs or inability to acquire components necessary for the manufacture of our products;
•absence of liquidity at customers and suppliers; and
•laws, regulations or other orders may limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or to provide service on products previously sold to those customers;
•intellectual property disputes can be expensive and could result in an inability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions;
•cybersecurity incidents could result in the loss of valuable information or assets or subject us to costly disruption, remediation, regulatory investigations, litigation and reputational damage;
•we may face disruptions if we cannot access critical information in a timely manner due to system failures;
•we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions;
•we are subject to exposure from tax and regulatory compliance audits;
•economic, political or other conditions in the jurisdictions where we earn profits can impact the tax laws and taxes we pay in those jurisdictions, subsequently impacting our effective tax rate, cash flows and results of operations; and
•we may not be able to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate;
•prevailing local and global economic conditions may negatively affect the purchasing decisions of our customers or the value of our investment portfolio.
business model and capital structure risks
•we may not be able to compete with new products introduced by our competitors;
•we may fail to operate our business in a manner consistent with our business plan;
•we may not have sufficient financial resources to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due;
•we may fail to comply with the covenants in our revolving credit facility (as defined below), which could impair our ability to borrow needed funds under the facility, or require us to repay it sooner than we planned;
•if our products fail to operate properly or contain defects or our customers are sued by third parties due to our products, we may be liable under indemnification provisions with our customers;
•we may incur significant restructuring charges or other asset impairment charges or inventory write-offs; and
•we are subject to risks related to receivables factoring arrangements, and compliance risk of certain settlement agreements with the government.
risks related to the covid-19 pandemic the current covid-19 pandemic and the potential aftereffects from it could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the covid-19 pandemic has caused substantial global disruptions, including in the jurisdictions where we conduct business and may cause additional disruptions in the future, which are impossible to predict.  local, regional and national authorities in numerous jurisdictions have implemented a variety of measures designed to slow the spread of the virus, including social distancing guidelines, quarantines, banning of non-essential travel and requiring the cessation of non-essential activities on the premises of businesses. while all of our global sites are currently operational, any local pandemic outbreaks could require us to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates.
covid-19 vaccines have been approved and become available for use in the united states and certain other countries. however, given our global operations, we are unable to predict how widely utilized the vaccines ultimately will be and whether they will be effective in preventing the spread of covid-19 (including its variant strains). in addition, although economic activity has begun to improve in recent months from the global reduction in economic activity in calendar year 2020 caused by the covid-19 pandemic, the pace of economic recovery remains uneven in various geographies, and the resumption of growth has caused us to experience new constraints in our supply chain as discussed below.
some of the risks associated with the pandemic or a worsening of the pandemic in the future include:
•cancellation or reduction of routes available from common carriers, which may cause delays in our ability to deliver or service our products or receive components from suppliers necessary to manufacture or service our products;
•shortages or disruption in the supply chain could affect our ability to procure components for our products on a timely basis or at all, or could require us to commit to increased purchases and provide longer lead times to secure critical components, which could increase inventory obsolescence risk (refer to the executive summary in part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," for additional information on supply constraints related to the covid-19 pandemic);
•travel bans or the requirement to quarantine for a lengthy period after entering a jurisdiction, which may delay our ability to install the products we sell or service those products following installation;
•governmental orders or employee exposure requiring us, our customers or our suppliers to discontinue manufacturing products at our respective facilities for a period of time;
•reduced demand for our products, delivery pushouts or cancellation of orders by our customers caused by a global recession resulting from the pandemic and the measures implemented by authorities to slow the spread of covid-19;
•increased costs or inability to acquire components necessary for the manufacture of our products due to reduced availability;
•absence of liquidity at customers and suppliers caused by disruptions from the pandemic, which may hamper the ability of customers to pay for the products they purchase on time or at all, or hamper the ability of our suppliers to continue to supply components to us in a timely manner or at all; and
if any of the foregoing risks occur or intensify during this pandemic, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
commercial, operational, financial and regulatory risks a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states, and we maintain significant operations outside the united states. we are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations.
a majority of our annual revenues are derived from outside the united states, and we maintain significant operations outside the united states. we expect that these conditions will continue in the foreseeable future. managing global operations and sites located throughout the world presents a number of challenges, including but not limited to:
•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses, trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes;
•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;
•managing cultural diversity and organizational alignment;
•exposure to the unique characteristics of each region in the global market, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period;
•potential adverse tax consequences, including withholding tax rules that may limit the repatriation of our earnings, and higher effective income tax rates in foreign countries where we do business;
•compliance with customs regulations in the countries in which we do business;
•political instability, natural disasters, legal or regulatory changes, acts of war or terrorism in regions where we have operations or where we do business;
•fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may adversely impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business. although we attempt to manage some of our near-term currency risks through the use of hedging instruments, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate;
•our ability to receive prepayments for certain of our products and services sold in certain jurisdictions.  these prepayments increase our cash flows for the quarter in which they are received.  if our practice of requiring prepayments in those jurisdictions changes or deteriorates, our cash flows would be harmed.
•longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable outside of the united states;
•difficulties in managing foreign distributors (including monitoring and ensuring our distributors' compliance with applicable laws); and
in addition, government controls, either by the united states or other countries, that restrict our business overseas or restrict our ability to import or export our products and services or increase the cost of our operations through the imposition of tariffs, new controls, outright bans, or otherwise, could harm our business. for example, commerce has added numerous china-based entities to the u.s. entity list, including fujian jinhua integrated circuit company, ltd., huawei, and semiconductor manufacturing international corporation, restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without an export license. even if we apply for licenses to sell our products or provide services to companies on commerce's u.s. entity list, there can be no assurance that licenses will be granted. in addition, commerce has imposed new export licensing requirements on china-based customers engaged in military end uses or where commerce has determined there is a risk of diversion to a military end use, as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on u.s. technology to manufacture products connected to huawei or its affiliates. to date, these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations, but we are continually monitoring their impact. if additional companies are added to commerce's u.s. entity list, or other licensing requirements or restrictions are imposed, thereby limiting our ability to sell our products or services to other customers in china, our business could be significantly harmed. similar actions by the u.s. government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers.
we are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy.
demand for our products is ultimately driven by the global demand for electronic devices by consumers and businesses. economic uncertainty frequently leads to reduced consumer and business spending, and can cause our customers to decrease, cancel or delay their equipment and service orders. the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit can make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell. reduced demand, combined with delays in our customers' ability to obtain financing (or the unavailability of such financing), has at times in the past adversely affected our product and service sales and revenues and therefore has harmed our business and operating results, and our operating results and financial condition may again be adversely impacted if economic conditions decline from their current levels.
in addition, a decline in the condition of the global financial markets could adversely impact the market values or liquidity of our investments. our investment portfolio includes corporate and government securities, money market funds and other types of debt and equity investments. although we believe our portfolio continues to be comprised of sound investments due to the quality and (where applicable) credit ratings of such investments, a decline in the capital and financial markets would adversely impact the market value of our investments and their liquidity. if the market value of such investments were to decline, or if we were to have to sell some of our investments under illiquid market conditions, we may be required to recognize an impairment charge on such investments or a loss on such sales, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
if we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
we might be involved in claims or disputes related to intellectual property or other confidential information that may be costly to resolve, prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology and seriously harm our operating results and financial condition.
as is typical in the industries in which we serve, from time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights or other intellectual property rights which they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. in addition, we occasionally receive notification from customers who believe that we owe them indemnification or other obligations related to intellectual property claims made against such customers by third parties. with respect to intellectual property infringement disputes, our customary practice is to evaluate such infringement assertions and to consider whether to seek licenses where appropriate. however, there can be no assurance that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. the inability to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on reasonable terms could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition. furthermore, we may potentially be subject to claims by customers, suppliers or other business partners, or by governmental law enforcement agencies, related to our receipt, distribution and/or use of third-party intellectual property or confidential information. legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their merit, and associated internal investigations with respect to intellectual property or confidential information disputes are often expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; may divert management's attention and other company resources; and/or may result in restrictions on our ability to sell our products, settlements on significantly adverse terms or adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines, any of which could have a significant negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. the instigation of legal proceedings or claims, our inability to favorably resolve or settle such proceedings or claims, or the determination of any adverse findings against us or any of our employees in connection with such proceedings or claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our business reputation.
we are subject to various risks related to compliance with laws, rules and regulations enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which we operate and with which we must comply, including environmental, safety, antitrust, anti-corruption/anti-bribery, unclaimed property, economic sanctions and export control regulations. we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable law, but there can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prove completely effective in ensuring compliance by all our personnel as well as our business partners and representatives, for whose misconduct we may under some circumstances be legally responsible. our failure or inability to comply with existing or future laws, rules or regulations in the countries in which we operate could result in government investigations and/or enforcement actions, which could result in significant financial cost (including investigation expenses, defense costs, assessments and criminal or civil penalties), reputational harm and other consequences that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to conduct our business. from time to time, we may receive inquiries, subpoenas, investigative demands, or audit notices from governmental or regulatory bodies, or we may make voluntary disclosures, related to legal, regulatory or tax compliance matters, and these matters may result in significant financial cost (including investigation expenses, defense costs, assessments and criminal or civil penalties), reputational harm and other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. in addition, we may be subject to new or amended laws, including laws that conflict with other applicable laws, which may impose compliance challenges and create the risk of non-compliance.
our properties and many aspects of our business operations are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations, including those that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, gases and other substances. any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations or requirements may subject us to a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. in addition, changes in environmental regulations (including regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions) could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment, alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute (potentially more expensive and/or rarer) materials. further, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by any release, regardless of fault. we also face increasing complexity in our manufacturing, product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and prospective requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including restrictions on lead and other substances and requirements to track the sources of certain metals and other materials. the cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to conduct our business.
in addition, we may from time to time be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding employment, immigration, contracts, product performance, product liability, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, unfair competition and other matters. these legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend, divert management's attention and resources, and/or inhibit our ability to sell our products. there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims, which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to operate our business.
our employees are vital to our success, and our key management, engineering and other employees are difficult to replace. we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees. further, we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees. the expansion of high technology companies worldwide has increased demand and competition for qualified personnel. competition for engineering and other technical personnel in many areas of the world in which we operate is especially intense due to the proliferation of technology companies worldwide. in addition, current or future immigration laws, policies or regulations may limit our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, or if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain additional highly qualified employees to meet our current and future needs, our business and operations could be harmed.
we outsource a number of services, including our transportation, information systems management and logistics management of spare parts and certain accounting and procurement functions, to domestic and overseas third-party service providers. while outsourcing arrangements may lower our cost of operations, they also reduce our direct control over the services rendered. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products delivered or services rendered, on our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions, or on our ability to ensure compliance with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations. in addition, many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ cloud computing technology for such storage. these providers' cloud computing systems may be susceptible to "cyber incidents," such as intentional cyber-attacks aimed at theft of sensitive data or inadvertent cyber-security compromises, which are outside of our control. if we do not effectively develop and manage our outsourcing strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if our third-party service providers do not perform as anticipated, or do not adequately protect our data from cyber-related security breaches, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, we may experience operational difficulties (such as limitations on our ability to ship products), increased costs, manufacturing or service interruptions or delays, loss of intellectual property rights or other sensitive data, quality and compliance issues, and challenges in managing our product inventory or recording and reporting financial and management information, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we depend on secure information technology for our business and are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and cyber incidents affecting our and our service providers' systems and networks.
in the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit and store data on information systems and networks, including systems and networks owned and maintained by kla and/or by third-party providers. this data includes confidential information, transactional information and intellectual property belonging to us, our customers and our business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of individuals. despite network security measures, our and our third-party providers' information systems and networks are susceptible to computer viruses, ransomware, cyber-related security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions, tampering, misuse, or criminal acts made directly against, or through our third-party providers in the supply chain, and against, our systems and networks, including phishing, or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate, which are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures. we have experienced cyber-related attacks in the past, and are likely to experience cyber-related attacks in the future. our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors, malfeasance, or otherwise. third parties may also attempt to influence employees, users, suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our, our customers' or business partners' data. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently, may not be recognized until launched against a target, and are increasingly designed to circumvent controls, to avoid detection and to remove or obfuscate forensic artifacts, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, to implement adequate preventative measures, or to adequately identify and investigate cybersecurity incidents..
any cybersecurity incident or occurrence could impact our business directly, or indirectly by impacting third parties in the supply chain, in many potential ways: disruptions to operations; misappropriation, corruption or theft of confidential information, including intellectual property and other critical data, of kla, our customers and other business partners; misappropriation of funds and company assets; reduced value of our investments in research, development and engineering; litigation with, or payment of damages to, third parties; reputational damage; costs to comply with regulatory inquiries or actions; data privacy issues; costs to rebuild our information systems and networks; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.
we carry insurance that provides limited protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident but it will not likely cover all such losses, and the losses that it does not cover may be significant.
we rely upon certain critical information systems for our daily business operations. our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact our business operations.
our global operations are dependent upon certain information systems, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, network communications, email and various computer hardware and software applications. system failures or malfunctions, such as difficulties with our customer relationship management system, could disrupt our operations and our ability to timely and accurately process and report key components of our financial results. our enterprise resource planning ("erp") system is integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records, record transactions, provide critical information to our management, and prepare our financial statements. any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our erp system or other systems (whether in connection with the regular operation, periodic enhancements, modifications or upgrades of such systems or the integration of our acquired businesses into such systems, or due to cybersecurity events such as ransomware attacks) could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes, such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
acquisitions are an important element of our strategy but, because of the uncertainties involved, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses. we are also exposed to risks in connection with strategic alliances into which we may enter.
in addition to our efforts to develop new technologies from internal sources, part of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions and acquire new technologies from external sources. as part of this effort, in february 2019, we announced that we had consummated our orbotech acquisition. we may also enter into definitive agreements for and consummate acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. there can be no assurance that we will find suitable acquisition candidates or that acquisitions we complete will be successful. in addition, we may use equity to finance future acquisitions, which would increase our number of shares outstanding and be dilutive to current stockholders.
if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses, if the costs associated with integrating the acquired business exceeds our expectations, or if acquired businesses perform poorly, then our business and financial results may suffer. it is possible that the businesses we have acquired, as well as businesses that we may acquire in the future, may perform worse than expected or prove to be more difficult to integrate and manage than anticipated. in addition, we may lose key employees of the acquired companies. risks associated with acquisition transactions may lead to a material adverse effect on our business and financial results for an additional number of reasons, including:
•the combination of businesses may result in the loss of key personnel or an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our company and/or the acquired business;
•we may not be able to realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from our acquisitions;
•we may face difficulties in coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;
•the customers, distributors, suppliers, employees and others with whom the companies we acquire have business dealings may have a potentially adverse reaction to the acquisition;
•we may have to write-off goodwill or other intangible assets; and
•we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions.
at times, we may also enter into strategic alliances with customers, suppliers or other business partners with respect to development of technology and intellectual property. these alliances typically require significant investments of capital and exchange of proprietary, highly sensitive information. the success of these alliances depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and requires ongoing and effective cooperation with our strategic partners. mergers and acquisitions and strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other operations, or in the operations of our customers, due to earthquake, flood, other natural catastrophic events, health epidemics or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries or other business activities, or loss of customers and could seriously harm our business.
we have significant manufacturing operations in the united states, singapore, israel, germany, united kingdom, italy and china. in addition, our business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers located in numerous countries throughout the world. operations at our manufacturing facilities and our assembly subcontractors, as well as our other operations and those of our customers, are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, health epidemics and pandemics, fire, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. such disruption could cause delays in, among other things, shipments of products to our customers, our ability to perform services requested by our customers, or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites. we cannot provide any assurance that alternate means of conducting our operations (whether through alternate production capacity or service providers or otherwise) would be available if a major disruption were to occur or that, if such alternate means were available, they could be obtained on favorable terms.
in addition, as part of our cost-cutting actions, we have consolidated several operating facilities. our california operations are now primarily centralized in our milpitas facility. the consolidation of our california operations into a single campus could further concentrate the risks related to any of the disruptive events described above, such as acts of war or terrorism, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters, if any such event were to impact our milpitas facility.
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war. if international political instability continues or increases, our business and results of operations could be harmed.
the threat of terrorism targeted at, or acts of war in, the regions of the world in which we do business increases the uncertainty in our markets. any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the industries we serve could adversely affect our business. increased international political instability in various parts of the world, disruption in air transportation and further enhanced security measures as a result of terrorist attacks may hinder our ability to do business and may increase our costs of operations. we maintain significant operations in israel. since the establishment of the state of israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors, and a state of hostility varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic challenges for israel. in addition, some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces, and may be called to active military duty in emergency circumstances. we cannot assess the impact that emergency conditions in israel in the future may have on our business, operations, financial condition or results of operations, but it could be material. instability in any region could directly impact our ability to operate our business (or our customers' ability to operate their businesses), cause us to incur increased costs in transportation, make such transportation unreliable, increase our insurance costs, and cause international currency markets to fluctuate. instability in the region could also have the same effects on our suppliers and their ability to timely deliver their products. if international political instability continues or increases in any region in which we do business, our business and results of operations could be harmed. we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war.
we purchase insurance to help mitigate the economic impact of certain insurable risks; however, certain risks are uninsurable, are insurable only at significant cost or cannot be mitigated with insurance. accordingly, we may experience a loss that is not covered by insurance, either because we do not carry applicable insurance or because the loss exceeds the applicable policy amount or is less than the deductible amount of the applicable policy. for example, we do not currently hold earthquake insurance. an earthquake could significantly disrupt our manufacturing operations, a significant portion of which are conducted in california, an area highly susceptible to earthquakes. it could also significantly delay our research and engineering efforts on new products, much of which is also conducted in california. we take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by an earthquake, but there is no certainty that our efforts will prove successful in the event of an earthquake. we self-insure earthquake risks because we believe this is a prudent financial decision based on our cash reserves and the high cost and limited coverage available in the earthquake insurance market. certain other risks are also self-insured either based on a similar cost-benefit analysis, or based on the unavailability of insurance. if one or more of the uninsured events occurs, we could suffer major financial loss.
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we hedge certain currency risks, we may still be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or declining economic conditions in these countries.
we have some exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the japanese yen, the euro, the pound sterling and the israeli new shekel. we have international subsidiaries that operate and sell our products globally. in addition, an increasing proportion of our manufacturing activities are conducted outside of the united states, and many of the costs associated with such activities are denominated in foreign currencies. we routinely hedge our exposures to certain foreign currencies with certain financial institutions in an effort to minimize the impact of certain currency exchange rate fluctuations, but these hedges may be inadequate to protect us from currency exchange rate fluctuations. to the extent that these hedges are inadequate, or if there are significant currency exchange rate fluctuations in currencies for which we do not have hedges in place, our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business could be adversely affected. furthermore, if a financial counterparty to our hedges experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of the foreign currency hedge, we may experience material financial losses.
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the market values of our portfolio investments, and an impairment of our investments could harm our earnings. in addition, we and our stockholders are exposed to risks related to the volatility of the market for our common stock.
our investment portfolio primarily consists of both corporate and government debt securities that are susceptible to changes in market interest rates and bond yields. as market interest rates and bond yields increase, those securities with a lower yield-at-cost show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. an impairment of the fair market value of our investments, even if unrealized, must be reflected in our financial statements for the applicable period and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period.
in addition, the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly during recent years. the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to various factors, including without limitation conditions in the semiconductor industry and other industries in which we operate, fluctuations in the global economy or capital markets, our operating results or other performance metrics, or adverse consequences experienced by us as a result of any of the risks described elsewhere in this item 1a. volatility in the market price of our common stock could cause an investor in our common stock to experience a loss on the value of their investment in us and could also adversely impact our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or to use our common stock as consideration to acquire other companies.
we are exposed to risks in connection with tax and regulatory compliance audits in various jurisdictions.
we are subject to tax and regulatory compliance audits (such as related to customs or product safety requirements) in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income or other taxes, penalties, fines or other prohibitions against us. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and that our products and practices comply with applicable regulations, the final determination of any such audit and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals related to income taxes and other contingencies. in addition to and in connection with the israel tax authority ("ita") assessment described in more detail in note 14 "income taxes" to our consolidated financial statements, there is an ongoing criminal investigation against our orbotech subsidiary, certain of its employees and its tax consultant that began prior to the acquisition date. we can make no assurances that an indictment will not result from the criminal investigation. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
we earn profits in, and are therefore potentially subject to taxes in, the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including singapore, israel and the cayman islands, the countries in which we earn the majority of our non-u.s. profits. due to economic, political or other conditions, tax rates in those jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the tax rates imposed by those jurisdictions; expiration of tax holidays in certain jurisdictions that are not renewed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development ("ipr&d") and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and the repatriation of earnings from outside the u.s. for which we have not previously provided for u.s. taxes. a change in our effective tax rate can materially and adversely impact our results from operations.
in addition, recent changes to u.s. tax laws will significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"), which was enacted into law on december 22, 2017. however, the recent u.s tax law changes are subject to future guidance from u.s. federal and state governments, such as the treasury department and/or the irs. any future guidance can change our tax liability. a significant portion of the income taxes due to the enactment of the tax act is payable by us over a period of eight years. as a result, our cash flows from operating activities will be adversely impacted until tax liability is paid in full. numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part, to recommendations made by the organization for economic co-operation and development's base erosion and profit shifting project. furthermore, president biden put forth several corporate income tax proposals during his campaign, including a significant increase in the corporate income tax rate and changes in the taxation of non-u.s. income. while it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals, if enacted, they could have a material impact on our income tax liability.
compliance with federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as nasdaq requirements, has become increasingly complex, and the significant attention and expense we must devote to those areas may have an adverse impact on our business.
federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as nasdaq rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations. these laws, rules and regulations have increased, and in the future are expected to continue to increase, the scope, complexity and cost of our corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices, which could harm our results of operations and divert management's attention from business operations.
risks associated with our industry ongoing changes in the technology industry, as well as the semiconductor industry in particular, could expose our business to significant risks.
the industries that we serve, including the semiconductor, fpd and pcb industries, are constantly developing and changing over time. many of the risks associated with operating in these industries are comparable to the risks faced by all technology companies, such as the uncertainty of future growth rates in the industries that we serve, pricing trends in the end-markets for consumer electronics and other products (which place a growing emphasis on our customers' cost of ownership), changes in our customers' capital spending patterns and, in general, an environment of constant change and development, including decreasing product and component dimensions; use of new materials; and increasingly complex device structures, applications and process steps. if we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to any of these trends, or, with respect to technological advances, if we do not timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
in addition, we face a number of risks specific to ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry, as a significant majority of our sales are our process control and yield management products sold to semiconductor manufacturers. some of the trends that our management monitors in operating our business include the following:
•the potential for reversal of the long-term historical trend of declining cost per transistor with each new generation of technological advancement within the semiconductor industry, and the adverse impact that such reversal may have upon our business;
•the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities and the impact of such increases on our customers' capital equipment investment decisions;
•differing market growth rates and capital requirements for different applications, such as memory and foundry/logic;
•the emergence of disruptive technologies that change the prevailing semiconductor manufacturing processes (or the economics associated with semiconductor manufacturing) and, as a result, also impact the inspection and metrology requirements associated with such processes;
•the possible introduction of integrated products by our larger competitors that offer inspection and metrology functionality in addition to managing other semiconductor manufacturing processes;
•the bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry into (a) leading edge manufacturers driving continued r&d into next-generation products and technologies and (b) other manufacturers that are content with existing (including previous generation) products and technologies;
•the ever escalating cost of next-generation product development, which may result in joint development programs between us and our customers or government entities to help fund such programs that could restrict our control of, ownership of and profitability from the products and technologies developed through those programs; and
•the entry by some semiconductor manufacturers into collaboration or sharing arrangements for capacity, cost or risk with other manufacturers, as well as increased outsourcing of their manufacturing activities, and greater focus only on specific markets or applications, whether in response to adverse market conditions or other market pressures.
any of the changes described above may negatively affect our customers' rate of investment in the capital equipment that we produce, which could result in downward pressure on our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins. if we do not successfully manage the risks resulting from any of these or other potential changes in our industries, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted.
we are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.
our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, historically has been highly concentrated due to corporate consolidation, acquisitions and business closures. in this environment, orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of our sales. this increasing concentration exposes our business, financial condition and operating results to a number of risks, including the following:
•the mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, which exposes our business and operating results to increased volatility tied to individual customers.
•new orders from our foundry/logic customers in the past several years have constituted a significant portion of our total orders. this concentration increases the impact that future business or technology changes within the foundry/logic industry may have on our business, financial condition and operating results.
•as a result of this consolidation, the customers that survive the consolidation represent a greater portion of our sales and, consequently, have greater commercial negotiating leverage. many of our large customers have more aggressive policies regarding engaging alternative, second-source suppliers for the products we offer and, in addition, may seek and, on occasion, receive pricing, payment, intellectual property-related or other commercial terms that may have an adverse impact on our business. any of these changes could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues and gross margins.
•certain customers have undergone significant ownership changes, created alliances with other companies, experienced management changes or have outsourced manufacturing activities, any of which may result in additional complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions. any future change in ownership or management of our existing customers may result in similar challenges, including the possibility of the successor entity or new management deciding to select a competitor's products.
•the highly concentrated business environment also increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each of our customers. for example, as a result of the challenging economic environment during fiscal year 2009, we were (and in some cases continue to be) exposed to additional risks related to the continued financial viability of certain of our customers. to the extent our customers experience liquidity issues in the future, we may be required to incur additional credit losses with respect to receivables owed to us by those customers. in addition, customers with liquidity issues may be forced to reduce purchases of our equipment, delay deliveries of our products, discontinue operations or may be acquired by one of our customers, and in either case such event would have the effect of further consolidating our customer base.
•semiconductor manufacturers generally must commit significant resources to qualify, install and integrate process control and yield management equipment into a semiconductor production line. we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier's process control and yield management equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time. accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for that specific production line application and other similar production line applications if that customer initially selects a competitor's equipment.
•prices differ among the products we offer for different applications due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs. if there is a shift in demand by our customers from our higher-priced to lower-priced products, our gross margin and revenues would decrease. in addition, when products are initially introduced, they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation, which can impact gross margin.
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
we operate in industries that have historically been cyclical, including the semiconductor industry. the purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the condition of the industry worldwide. if we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted.
the timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the industries in which we serve are difficult to predict. the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry in which we primarily operate is largely a function of our customers' capital spending patterns and need for expanded manufacturing capacity, which in turn are affected by factors such as capacity utilization, consumer demand for products, inventory levels and our customers' access to capital. cyclicality affects our ability to accurately predict future revenue and, in some cases, future expense levels. during down cycles in our industry, the financial results of our customers may be negatively impacted, which could result not only in a decrease in, or cancellation or delay of, orders (which are generally subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty) but also a weakening of their financial condition that could impair their ability to pay for our products or our ability to recognize revenue from certain customers. our ability to recognize revenue from a particular customer may also be negatively impacted by the customer's funding status, which could be weakened not only by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets for any number of macroeconomic or company-specific reasons, but also by funding limitations imposed by the customer's unique organizational structure. any of these factors could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
when cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results may be adversely affected and cost reduction measures may be necessary for us to remain competitive and financially sound. during periods of declining revenues, we must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and to continue to motivate and retain our key employees. if we fail to respond, or if our attempts to respond fail to accomplish our intended results, then our business could be seriously harmed. furthermore, any workforce reductions and cost reduction actions that we adopt in response to down cycles may result in additional restructuring charges, disruptions in our operations and loss of key personnel. in addition, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand. we can provide no assurance that these objectives can be met in a timely manner in response to industry cycles. each of these factors could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.
in addition, our management typically provides quarterly forecasts for certain financial metrics, which, when made, are based on business and operational forecasts that are believed to be reasonable at the time. however, largely due to the historical cyclicality of our business and the industries in which we operate, and the fact that business conditions in our industries can change very rapidly as part of these cycles, our actual results may vary (and have varied in the past) from forecasted results. these variations can occur for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, unexpected changes in the volume or timing of customer orders, product shipments or product acceptance; an inability to adjust our operations rapidly enough to adapt to changing business conditions; or a different than anticipated effective tax rate. the impact on our business of delays or cancellations of customer orders may be exacerbated by the short lead times that our customers expect between order placement and product shipment. this is because order delays and cancellations may lead not only to lower revenues, but also, due to the advance work we must do in anticipation of receiving a product order to meet the expected lead times, to significant inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease our gross margin. any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our financial results for a particular quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from financial forecasts we have previously provided. we provide these forecasts with the intent of giving investors and analysts a better understanding of management's expectations for the future, but those reviewing such forecasts must recognize that such forecasts are comprised of, and are themselves, forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this item 1a and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. if our operating or financial results for a particular period differ from our forecasts or the expectations of investment analysts, or if we revise our forecasts, the market price of our common stock could decline.
risks related to our business model and capital structure if we do not develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, our business could be seriously harmed.
success in the industries in which we serve, including the semiconductor, fpd and pcb industries depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions. the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips. that driver appears to be slowing, which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to delay investments in equipment, investigate more complex device architectures, use new materials and develop innovative fabrication processes. these and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development programs and cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support. technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate staffing of highly qualified employees. our competitive advantage and future business success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards, develop and introduce new products and solutions that successfully address changing customer needs, win market acceptance of these new products and solutions, and manufacture these new products in a timely and cost-effective manner. our failure to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop as well as offer competitive technology solutions in a timely manner with cost-effective products could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
we must continue to make significant investments in r&d in order to enhance the performance, features and functionality of our products, to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands. substantial r&d costs typically are incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products. there can be no assurance that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements. in addition, we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us. our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products.
in addition, the complexity of our products exposes us to other risks. we regularly recognize revenue from a sale upon shipment of the applicable product to the customer (even before receiving the customer's formal acceptance of that product) in certain situations, including sales of products for which installation is considered perfunctory, transactions in which the product is sold to an independent distributor and we have no installation obligations, and sales of products where we have previously delivered the same product to the same customer location and that prior delivery has been accepted. however, our products are very technologically complex and rely on the interconnection of numerous subcomponents (all of which must perform to their respective specifications), so it is conceivable that a product for which we recognize revenue upon shipment may ultimately fail to meet the overall product's required specifications. in such a situation, the customer may be entitled to certain remedies, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results for various periods and, as a result, our stock price.
we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of inspection products. as a result, any delay or reduction of sales of these products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. the continued customer demand for these products and the development, introduction and market acceptance of new products and technologies are critical to our future success.
our success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. we own various united states and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies and obtain patents relating to our business that are similar or superior to our technology or may design around the patents we own, which may adversely affect our business. in addition, we at times engage in collaborative technology development efforts with our customers and suppliers, and these collaborations may constitute a key component of certain of our ongoing technology and product r&d projects. the termination of any such collaboration, or delays caused by disputes or other unanticipated challenges that may arise in connection with any such collaboration, could significantly impair our r&d efforts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations.
while patent, copyright and trademark protection for our intellectual property is important, we believe our future success in highly dynamic markets is most dependent upon the technical competence and creative skills of our personnel. we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. we also maintain exclusive and non-exclusive licenses with third parties for strategic technology used in certain products. however, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. in addition, the laws of certain territories in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states. in any event, the extent to which we can protect our trade secrets through the use of confidentiality agreements is limited, and our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors.
our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully worldwide.
our industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide. some of our competitors are diversified companies with greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support capabilities than we possess. we face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products and services, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer. these competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products, including pricing such competitive tools significantly below our product offerings. in addition, we face competition from smaller emerging companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer, using innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. the strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology, which is the result of continuing significant investments in product r&d. however, we may enter new markets, whether through acquisitions or new internal product development, in which competition is based primarily on product pricing, not technological superiority. further, some new growth markets that emerge may not require leading technologies. loss of competitive position in any of the markets we serve, or an inability to sell our products on favorable commercial terms in new markets we may enter, could negatively affect our prices, customer orders, revenues, gross margins and market share, any of which would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.
we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products, including custom electronic and mechanical components, and we use numerous suppliers to supply these materials. we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers. because of the variability and uniqueness of customers' orders, we do not maintain an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing. through our business interruption planning, we seek to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by, among other things, monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts. although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, certain key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. also, key parts we obtain from some of our suppliers incorporate the suppliers' proprietary intellectual property; in those cases, we are increasingly reliant on third parties for high-performance, high-technology components, which reduces the amount of control we have over the availability and protection of the technology and intellectual property that is used in our products. in addition, if certain of our key suppliers experience liquidity issues and are forced to discontinue operations, which is a heightened risk especially during economic downturns, it could affect their ability to deliver parts and could result in delays for our products. similarly, especially with respect to suppliers of high-technology components, our suppliers themselves have increasingly complex supply chains, and delays or disruptions at any stage of their supply chains may prevent us from obtaining parts in a timely manner and result in delays for our products. our operating results and business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts to meet our production requirements and product specifications, or if we are only able to do so on unfavorable terms. furthermore, a supplier may discontinue production of a particular part for any number of reasons, including the supplier's financial condition or business operational decisions, which would require us to purchase, in a single transaction, a large number of such discontinued parts in order to ensure that a continuous supply of such parts remains available to our customers. such "end-of-life" parts purchases could result in significant expenditures by us in a particular period, and ultimately any unused parts may result in a significant inventory write-off, either of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the applicable periods. refer to the executive summary in part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," for additional information on supply constraints related to the covid-19 pandemic.
if we fail to operate our business in accordance with our business plan, our operating results, business and stock price may be significantly and adversely impacted.
we attempt to operate our business in accordance with a business plan that is established annually, revised frequently (generally quarterly), and reviewed by management even more frequently (at least monthly). our business plan is developed based on a number of factors, many of which require estimates and assumptions, such as our expectations of the economic environment, future business levels, our customers' willingness and ability to place orders, lead-times, and future revenue and cash flow. our budgeted operating expenses, for example, are based in part on our future revenue expectations. however, our ability to achieve our anticipated revenue levels is a function of numerous factors, including the volatile and historically cyclical nature of our primary industry, customer order cancellations, macroeconomic changes, operational matters regarding particular agreements, our ability to manage customer deliveries, the availability of resources for the installation of our products, delays or accelerations by customers in taking deliveries and the acceptance of our products (for products where customer acceptance is required before we can recognize revenue from such sales), our ability to operate our business and sales processes effectively, and a number of the other risk factors set forth in this item 1a.
because our expenses are in most cases relatively fixed in the short term, any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our operating results. similarly, if we fail to manage our expenses effectively or otherwise fail to maintain rigorous cost controls, we could experience greater than anticipated expenses during an operating period, which would also negatively affect our results of operations. if we fail to operate our business consistent with our business plan, our operating results in any period may be significantly and adversely impacted. such an outcome could cause customers, suppliers or investors to view us as less stable, or could cause us to fail to meet financial analysts' revenue or earnings estimates, any of which could have an adverse impact on our stock price.
in addition, our management is constantly striving to balance the requirements and demands of our customers with the availability of resources, the need to manage our operating model and other factors. in furtherance of those efforts, we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing, deliveries, installations and payment scheduling. any such decisions may impact our ability to recognize revenue, including the fiscal period during which such revenue may be recognized, with respect to such products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or stock price.
we have a leveraged capital structure.
as of june 30, 2021, we had $3.47 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, consisting of $3.45 billion aggregate principal amount of senior, unsecured long-term notes. in november 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") providing for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility"), which replaced our prior credit facility. subject to the terms of the credit agreement, the revolving credit facility may be increased by an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. we have no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and an additional $1.00 billion in unfunded commitments. we may incur additional indebtedness in the future by accessing the unfunded portion of our revolving credit facility and/or entering into new financing arrangements. for example, at the same time we announced our intention to acquire orbotech, we also announced a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase up to $3.00 billion of our common stock, a large portion of which may be financed with new indebtedness. our ability to pay interest and repay the principal amount of our current indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, our credit rating, the ongoing interest rate environment and the other risk factors discussed in this item 1a. there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.
in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of our senior notes (as defined below) by at least two of moody's investors service ("moody's"), s&p global ratings ("s&p") and fitch inc. ("fitch"), unless we have exercised our right to redeem the senior notes of such series, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder's option, any part, of each holder's senior notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below (the "change of control offer"). in the change of control offer, we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of senior notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the senior notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase. we cannot make any assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time nor that we will be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of that series of senior notes. our ability to repurchase that series of senior notes in such event may be limited by law, by the indenture associated with that series of senior notes, or by the terms of other agreements to which we may be party at such time. if we fail to repurchase that series of senior notes as required by the terms of such senior notes, it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing that series of senior notes which, in turn, may also constitute an event of default under our other obligations.
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate, and an increase in interest rates would require us to pay additional interest on any borrowings, which may have an adverse effect on the value and liquidity of our debt and the market price of our common stock could decline. the interest rate under our revolving credit facility is also subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. additionally, under our revolving credit facility, we are required to comply with affirmative and negative covenants, which include the maintenance of certain financial ratios, the details of which can be found in note 8 "debt" to our consolidated financial statements.
if we fail to comply with these covenants, we will be in default and our borrowings will become immediately due and payable. there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources nor that we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time. in addition, certain of our domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our borrowings under our revolving credit facility. in the event we default on our borrowings, these domestic subsidiaries shall be liable for our borrowings, which could disrupt our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or stock price.
our leveraged capital structure may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and net income per share.
our substantial amount of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including, but not limited to:
•a negative impact on our ability to satisfy our future obligations;
•an increase in the portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments that may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, dividends, stock repurchases, general corporate or other purposes;
•an impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; and
•obligations to comply with restrictive and financial covenants as noted in the above risk factor and note 8 "debt" to our consolidated financial statements.
our ability to satisfy our future expenses as well as our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. furthermore, our future operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our future expenses and service our debt obligations, which may impact our ability to manage our capital structure to preserve and maintain our investment grade rating. if our future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows, we may need to access the money available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility or enter into new financing arrangements to obtain necessary funds. if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms. any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will place further pressure on us to comply with the financial covenants. if we fail to make a payment associated with our debt obligations, we could be in default on such debt, and such a default could cause us to be in default on our other obligations.
we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. however, future dividends may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our r&d; legal risks; stock repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; changes to our business model; and our increased interest and principal payments required by our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future. our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts. a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.
we are exposed to risks related to our commercial terms and conditions, including our indemnification of third parties, as well as the performance of our products.
although our standard commercial documentation sets forth the terms and conditions that we intend to apply to commercial transactions with our business partners, counterparties to such transactions may not explicitly agree to our terms and conditions. in situations where we engage in business with a third party without an explicit master agreement regarding the applicable terms and conditions, or where the commercial documentation applicable to the transaction is subject to varying interpretations, we may have disputes with those third parties regarding the applicable terms and conditions of our business relationship with them. such disputes could lead to a deterioration of our commercial relationship with those parties, costly and time-consuming litigation, or additional concessions or obligations being offered by us to resolve such disputes, or could impact our revenue or cost recognition. any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, in our commercial agreements, from time to time in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers, suppliers and lessors, with respect to certain matters. we have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. we may be compelled to enter into or accrue for probable settlements of alleged indemnification obligations, or we may be subject to potential liability arising from our customers' involvements in legal disputes. in addition, notwithstanding the provisions related to limitations on our liability that we seek to include in our business agreements, the counterparties to such agreements may dispute our interpretation or application of such provisions, and a court of law may not interpret or apply such provisions in our favor, any of which could result in an obligation for us to pay material damages to third parties and engage in costly legal proceedings. it is difficult to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under any indemnification obligations, whether or not asserted, due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in any particular claim. our business, financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in defending or settling any purported claims, regardless of their merit or outcomes.
we are also exposed to potential costs associated with unexpected product performance issues. our products and production processes are extremely complex and, thus, could contain unexpected product defects, especially when products are first introduced. unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs being incurred by us, including increased service or warranty costs, providing product replacements for (or modifications to) defective products, litigation related to defective products, reimbursement for damages caused by our products, product recalls, or product write-offs or disposal costs. these costs could be substantial and could have an adverse impact upon our business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, our reputation with our customers could be damaged as a result of such product defects, which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact our business.
furthermore, we occasionally enter into volume purchase agreements with our larger customers, and these agreements may provide for certain volume purchase incentives, such as credits toward future purchases. we believe that these arrangements are beneficial to our long-term business, as they are designed to encourage our customers to purchase larger volumes of our products. however, these arrangements could require us to recognize a reduced level of revenue for the products that are initially purchased, to account for the potential future credits or other volume purchase incentives. our volume purchase agreements require significant estimation for the amounts to be accrued depending upon the estimate of volume of future purchases. as such, we are required to update our estimates of the accruals on a periodic basis. until the earnings process is complete, our estimates could differ in comparison to actual results. as a result, these volume purchase arrangements, while expected to be beneficial to our business over time, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in near-term periods, including the revenue we can recognize on product sales and therefore our gross margins.
in addition, we may in limited circumstances enter into agreements that contain customer-specific commitments on pricing, tool reliability, spare parts stocking levels, response time and other commitments. furthermore, we may give these customers limited audit or inspection rights to enable them to confirm that we are complying with these commitments. if a customer elects to exercise its audit or inspection rights, we may be required to expend significant resources to support the audit or inspection, as well as to defend or settle any dispute with a customer that could potentially arise out of such audit or inspection. to date, we have made no significant accruals in our consolidated financial statements for this contingency. while we have not in the past incurred significant expenses for resolving disputes regarding these types of commitments, we cannot make any assurance that we will not incur any such liabilities in the future. our business, financial condition and results of operations in a reported fiscal period could be materially and adversely affected if we expend significant amounts in supporting an audit or inspection, or defending or settling any purported claims, regardless of their merit or outcomes.
there are risks associated with our receipt of government funding for research and development.
we are exposed to additional risks related to our receipt of external funding for certain strategic development programs from various governments and government agencies, both domestically and internationally. governments and government agencies typically have the right to terminate funding programs at any time in their sole discretion, or a project may be terminated by mutual agreement if the parties determine that the project's goals or milestones are not being achieved, so there is no assurance that these sources of external funding will continue to be available to us in the future. in addition, under the terms of these government grants, the applicable granting agency typically has the right to audit the costs that we incur, directly and indirectly, in connection with such programs. any such audit could result in modifications to, or even termination of, the applicable government funding program. for example, if an audit were to identify any costs as being improperly allocated to the applicable program, those costs would not be reimbursed, and any such costs that had already been reimbursed would have to be refunded. we do not know the outcome of any future audits. any adverse finding resulting from any such audit could lead to penalties (financial or otherwise), termination of funding programs, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from receiving future government funding from the applicable government or government agency, any of which could adversely impact our operating results, financial condition and ability to operate our business.
we have recorded significant restructuring, inventory write-off and asset impairment charges and may do so again in the future, which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations.
historically, we have recorded material restructuring charges related to our prior global workforce reductions, large excess inventory write-offs, and material impairment charges related to our goodwill and purchased intangible assets. workforce changes can also temporarily reduce workforce productivity, which could be disruptive to our business and adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected cost savings or other benefits of our restructuring plans, or do so within the expected time frame. if we again restructure our organization and business processes, implement additional cost-reduction actions or discontinue certain business operations, we may take additional, potentially material, restructuring charges related to, among other things, employee terminations or exit costs. we may also be required to write-off additional inventory if our product build plans or usage of service inventory decline. also, as our lead times from suppliers increase (due to the increasing complexity of the parts and components they provide) and the lead times demanded by our customers decrease (due to the time pressures they face when introducing new products or technology or bringing new facilities into production), we may be compelled to increase our commitments, and therefore our risk exposure, to inventory purchases to meet our customers' demands in a timely manner, and that inventory may need to be written-off if demand for the underlying product declines for any reason. such additional write-offs could result in material charges.
we have recorded material charges related to the impairment of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets. goodwill represents the excess of costs over the net fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized, but is instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with authoritative guidance for goodwill. purchased intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives based on economic benefit if known or using the straight-line method, and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance for long-lived assets. the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets requires assumptions and estimates of many critical factors, including, but not limited to, declines in our operating cash flows, declines in our stock price or market capitalization, declines in our market share, and declines in revenues or profits. a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we previously used to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets (and, as applicable, the amount of any previous impairment charge), could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an additional impairment charge.
any such additional material charges, whether related to restructuring or goodwill or purchased intangible asset impairment, may have a material negative impact on our operating results and related financial statements.
we are exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements with respect to receivables factoring and banking arrangements.
we enter into factoring arrangements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. in addition, we maintain bank accounts with several domestic and foreign financial institutions, any of which may prove not to be financially viable. if we were to stop entering into these factoring arrangements, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by delays or failures in collecting trade receivables. however, by entering into these arrangements, and by engaging these financial institutions for banking services, we are exposed to additional risks. if any of these financial institutions experiences financial difficulties or is otherwise unable to honor the terms of our factoring or deposit arrangements, we may experience material financial losses due to the failure of such arrangements or a lack of access to our funds, any of which could have an adverse impact upon our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
we are subject to the risks of additional government actions in the event we were to breach the terms of any settlement arrangement into which we have entered.
in connection with the settlement of certain government actions and other legal proceedings related to our historical stock option practices, we have explicitly agreed as a condition to such settlements that we will comply with certain laws, such as the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. if we were to violate any such law, we might not only be subject to the significant penalties applicable to such violation, but our past settlements may also be impacted by such violation, which could give rise to additional government actions or other legal proceedings. any such additional actions or proceedings may require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses, and may divert attention and resources from the operation of our business. these expenditures and diversions, as well as an adverse resolution of any such action or proceeding, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in item 1a "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k (see "special note regarding forward-looking statements"). discussions and analysis of fiscal year 2020 as compared against fiscal year 2019 have been omitted and can be found in item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020, filed with the sec.
executive summary we are a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions and services for the semiconductor and related electronics industries. our broad portfolio of inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, support r&d and manufacturing of ics, wafers and reticles. our products, services and expertise are used by our customers to measure, detect, analyze and resolve critical and nanometric level product defects, helping them to manage manufacturing process challenges and to obtain higher finish product yields at lower cost. we also offer advanced technology solutions to address various manufacturing needs of pcbs, fpds, specialty semiconductor devices and other electronic components, including advanced packaging, led, power devices, compound semiconductor, and data storage industries, as well as general materials research.
our semiconductor customers generally operate in one or both of the major semiconductor device manufacturing markets: memory and foundry/logic. the pervasive and increasing needs for semiconductors in many consumer and industrial products, the rapid proliferation of new applications for more advanced semiconductor devices, and the increasing complexity associated with leading edge semiconductor manufacturing drives demand for our process control and yield management solutions. other demand trends include the growth of end-market drivers such as ai, the deployment of 5g telecommunications technology and associated high-end mobile devices, the electrification and digitalization of the automotive industry, the revival of personal computer demand and associated innovations to support remote work, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment, and the growth of the internet of things ("iot"). the favorable end market dynamics are driving our customers to make increased investments in our process control and yield management solutions as part of their overall capital investment plans. these trends also drive demand for our other products such as those used in the pcb, fpd and specialty semiconductor manufacturing, where the increase in technology complexity is expected to continue and further accelerate as more devices become interconnected and dependent on other electronic devices. as a result of these factors, we saw a general strengthening of demand for our products throughout fiscal 2021. our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, has become increasingly concentrated, so large orders from a relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our sales, which potentially exposes us to more earnings volatility.
•specialty semiconductor process: advanced vacuum deposition and etching process tools used by a broad range of specialty semiconductor customers.
a majority of our revenues are derived from outside the united states, and include geographic regions such as taiwan, china, korea, japan, europe and israel, and rest of asia. china is emerging as a major region for manufacturing of logic and memory chips, adding to its role as the world's largest consumer of ics. additionally, a significant portion of global fpd and pcb manufacturing has migrated to china. government initiatives are propelling china to expand its domestic manufacturing capacity and attracting investment from semiconductor manufacturers from taiwan, korea, japan and the united states. although china is currently seen as an important long-term growth region for the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment sector, commerce has added certain china-based entities to the u.s. entity list, restricting our ability to provide products and services to such entities without a license. in addition, commerce has imposed new export licensing requirements on china-based customers engaged in military end uses, as well as requiring our customers to obtain an export license when they use certain semiconductor capital equipment based on u.s. technology to manufacture products connected to huawei or its affiliates. while these new rules have not significantly impacted our operations to date, such actions by the u.s. government or another country could impact our ability to provide our products and services to existing and potential customers and adversely affect our business.

(2)our net income attributable to kla for the year ended june 30, 2020 includes a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $256.6 million and a pre-tax charge of $22.5 million as a result of the extinguishment of debt. for additional details, refer to note 7 "goodwill and purchased intangible assets" and note 8 "debt" to our consolidated financial statements.
events surrounding the covid-19 pandemic had resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe in calendar year 2020. vaccinations and pandemic containment measures have now created an environment that is driving economic growth, even as pace of economic recovery remains uneven in various geographies. the resumption of growth has caused us to experience new constraints in our supply chain. supply lead times are extended and shortages have sometimes required us to increase our purchase commitments to secure critical components on a timely basis.
while all of our global sites are currently operational, any local pandemic outbreaks could require us to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates. we remain committed to the health and safety of our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, and are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of covid-19.
our efforts to respond to the covid-19 pandemic have included health screenings, social distancing, employee separation protocols at our facilities, suspension of non-essential business travel and work from home to the extent possible. we are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate, and continuing to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements, relevant regulations, industry standards, and best practices to help safeguard our team members, while safely continuing operations to the extent possible at our sites across the globe.
we believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, while allowing us to safely continue operations. we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities.
critical accounting estimates and policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying our accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain reasonable under current conditions. actual results could differ from those estimates. we discuss the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis, and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosure in this annual report on form 10-k. the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:
revenue recognition. we primarily derive revenue from the sale of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related nanoelectronics industries, maintenance and support of all these products, installation and training services, and the sale of spare parts. our portfolio also includes yield enhancement and production solutions used by manufacturers of pcbs, fpds, advanced packaging, mems and other electronic components. our solutions are generally not sold with a right of return, nor have we experienced significant returns from or refunds to our customers.
we account for a contract with a customer when there is approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. our revenues are measured based on consideration stipulated in the arrangement with each customer, net of any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes. the revenues are recognized as separate performance obligations that are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to the customer. our arrangements with our customers include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. a product or service is considered distinct if it is separately identifiable from other deliverables in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. the transaction consideration, including any sales incentives, is allocated between separate performance obligations of an arrangement based on the stand-alone selling prices ("ssp") for each distinct product or service. management considers a variety of factors to determine the ssp, such as historical stand-alone sales of products and services, discounting strategies and other observable data. from time to time, our contracts are modified to account for additional, or to change existing, performance obligations. our contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively.
•the customer has legal title;
•the customer has accepted the product, or whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of similar products (for example, when the customer has previously accepted the same tool, with the same specifications, and when we can objectively demonstrate that the tool meets all of the required acceptance criteria, and when the installation of the system is deemed perfunctory).
not all of the indicators need to be met for us to conclude that control has transferred to the customer. in circumstances in which revenue is recognized prior to the product acceptance, the portion of revenue associated with our performance obligations to install product is deferred and recognized upon acceptance.
we enter into volume purchase agreements with some of our customers. we adjust the transaction consideration for estimated credits earned by our customers for such incentives. these credits are estimated based upon the forecasted and actual product sales for any given period and agreed-upon incentive rate. the estimate is updated at each reporting period.
we offer perpetual and term licenses for software products. the primary difference between perpetual and term licenses is the duration over which the customer can benefit from the use of the software, while the functionality and the features of the software are the same. software is generally bundled with post-contract customer support ("pcs"), which includes unspecified software updates that are made available throughout the entire term of the arrangement. revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time, when the software is made available to the customer. revenue from pcs is deferred at contract inception and recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
services and spare parts revenue the majority of product sales include a standard six to 12-month warranty that is not separately paid for by the customers. the customers may also purchase extended warranties for periods beyond the initial year as part of the initial product sale. we have concluded that the standard 12-month warranty as well as any extended warranty periods included in the initial product sales are separate performance obligations for most of our products. the estimated fair value of warranty services is deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the warranty period, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of warranty services provided by us.
additionally, we offer product maintenance and support services, which the customer may purchase separately from the standard and extended warranty offered as part of the initial product sale. revenue from separately negotiated maintenance and support service contracts is also recognized over time based on the terms of the applicable service period. revenue from services performed in the absence of a maintenance contract, including training revenue, is recognized when the related services are performed. we also sell spare parts, revenue from which is recognized when control over the spare parts is transferred to the customer.
installation services include connecting and validating configuration of the product. in addition, several testing protocols are completed to confirm the equipment is performing to customer specifications. revenues from product installation are deferred and recognized at a point in time, once installation is complete.
significant judgments our contracts with our customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. each product and service is generally capable of being distinct within the context of the contract and represents a separate performance obligation. determining the ssp for each distinct performance obligation and allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are significant judgments with respect to these arrangements. we typically estimate the ssp of products and services based on observable transactions when the products and services are sold on a stand-alone basis and those prices fall within a reasonable range. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of these products by customers and circumstances. in these instances, we use information such as the size of the customer, geographic region, as well as customization of the products in determining the ssp. in instances where the ssp is not directly observable, we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions, entity-specific factors, including discounting strategies, information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available and other observable inputs. while changes in the allocation of ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular contract, any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.
although the products are generally not sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or sales incentives, which are accounted for either as variable consideration or material right, depending on the specific terms and conditions of the arrangement. these credits and incentives are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if and when additional information becomes available.
contract assets/liabilities the timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections may result in accounts receivable, contract assets, and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on our consolidated balance sheets. a receivable is recorded in the period we deliver products or provide services when we have an unconditional right to payment. contract assets primarily relate to the value of products and services transferred to the customer for which the right to payment is not just dependent on the passage of time. contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional.
a contract liability is recognized when we receive payment or have an unconditional right to payment in advance of the satisfaction of performance. the contract liabilities represent (1) deferred product revenue related to the value of products that have been shipped and billed to customers and for which control has not been transferred to the customers, and (2) deferred service revenue, which is recorded when we receive consideration, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract. deferred service revenue typically results from warranty services, and maintenance and other service contracts.
contract assets and liabilities related to rights and obligations in a contract are recorded net in the consolidated balance sheets.
business combinations. accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain. critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows including revenue growth rate assumptions from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop ipr&d into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, including assumptions associated with the technology migration curve, estimated royalty rates used in valuing technology related intangible assets, and discount rates. the discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including ipr&d, based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which will not exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.
the fair value of ipr&d is initially capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the ipr&d assets may not be recoverable. impairment of ipr&d is recorded to r&d expenses. when an ipr&d project is completed, the ipr&d is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized to costs of revenues over the asset's estimated useful life.
acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.
inventories. inventories are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. demonstration units are stated at their manufacturing cost and written down to their net realizable value. we review and set standard costs semi-annually at current manufacturing costs in order to approximate actual costs. our manufacturing overhead standards for product costs are calculated assuming full absorption of forecasted spending over projected volumes, adjusted for excess capacity. abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and spoilage are recognized as current period charges. we write down product inventory based on forecasted demand and technological obsolescence and service spare parts inventory based on forecasted usage. these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require estimates that may include uncertain elements. actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values.
allowance for credit losses. a majority of our accounts receivable are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor and electronics manufacturers throughout the world. we maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable and assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. the estimate of expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. the allowance for credit losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance. however, volatility in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability that may have a material impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods.
accounting for stock-based compensation plans. compensation expense for restricted stock units ("rsus") with performance metrics is calculated based upon expected achievement of the metrics specified in the grant, or when a grant contains a market condition, the grant date fair value using a monte carlo simulation. the monte carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the award's expected life, the price volatility of the underlying stock, as well as the potential outcomes of the market condition on the grant date of each award.
contingencies and litigation. we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies. an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we accrue a liability and recognize as expense the estimated costs incurred to defend or settle asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. see note 16 "commitments and contingencies" and note 15 "litigation and other legal matters" to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.
goodwill and purchased intangible assets - impairment assessments. we review goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. pursuant to the authoritative guidance, we make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and allocate shared assets and liabilities to those reporting units, which determines the carrying values for each reporting unit. when assessing goodwill for impairment, an initial assessment of qualitative factors determines whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. judgments related to qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, relevant entity-specific events, a sustained decrease in share price and other events affecting the reporting units. if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to its carrying value including goodwill. if the former is lower, goodwill is written down by the excess amount, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. see note 7 "goodwill and purchased intangible assets" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using the market approach when deemed appropriate and the necessary information is available, or the income approach which uses discounted cash flow ("dcf") analysis, or a combination of both. if multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted. determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, revenue growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. discount rates are based on a weighted-average cost of capital ("wacc"), which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity, plus a risk premium. the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies. the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts. the market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies.
we review purchased finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are shorter than initially expected. we determine whether finite-lived intangible assets are recoverable based on the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest-level associated asset grouping. assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective. if the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived assets' carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. our indefinite-lived intangible assets are ipr&d intangible assets.
any impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and net asset value in the quarter in which we recognize the impairment charge. see note 7 "goodwill and purchased intangible assets" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
income taxes. we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires income tax effects for changes in tax laws to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted.
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. the guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. we have determined that a valuation allowance is necessary against a portion of the deferred tax assets, but we anticipate that our future taxable income will be sufficient to recover the remainder of our deferred tax assets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets that are not subject to a valuation allowance, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. this would result in an increase to our tax provision in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable.
on a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective income tax rate. the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. if actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained in audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activities. any change in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
we record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. our effective tax rate would be adversely affected if we change our intent or if such undistributed earnings are needed for u.s. operations because we would be required to provide or pay income taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings.
global intangible low-taxed income. the tax act includes provisions for global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. this income will effectively be taxed at a 10.5% tax rate in general. as a result, our deferred tax assets and liabilities were evaluated to determine if the deferred tax assets and liabilities should be recognized for the basis differences expected to reverse as a result of gilti provisions that are effective for us after the fiscal year ending june 30, 2018, or if the tax on gilti provisions should be recognized as period costs in each year incurred. we elected to account for gilti as a component of current period tax expense starting from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending june 30, 2019.
product revenues our business is affected by the concentration of our customer base and our customers' capital equipment procurement schedules as a result of their investment plans. our product revenues in any particular period are significantly impacted by the amount of new orders that we receive during that period and, depending upon the duration of manufacturing and installation cycles, in the preceding period.
service revenues service revenues are generated from product maintenance and support services, as well as billable time and material service calls made to our customers. the amount of our service revenues is typically a function of the number of systems installed at our customers' sites and the utilization of those systems, but it is also impacted by other factors, such as our rate of service contract renewals, the types of systems being serviced and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
the increase in service revenues by 14% in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of systems installed at our customers' sites.

taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited                   taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited                   taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited samsung electronics co., ltd.                                        samsung electronics co., ltd.
revenues by region we have revised the fiscal 2020 revenue by geographic regions as presented below as well as in note 19 "segment reporting and geographic information." the revisions were to correct the amount of revenue allocated to each geographic region. these revisions had no impact on the previously issued consolidated balance sheet, statements of operations, statements of cash flows, statements of comprehensive income (loss) or statements of stockholders' equity as of and for the year-ended june 30, 2020 and we determined that the impact of the revisions was not material to our previously issued consolidated financial statements.
united states                             765,974                11   %                  651,328                11   %                  596,452                13   %
a significant portion of our revenues continues to be generated in asia, where a substantial portion of the world's semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located, and we expect that trend to continue.
gross margin our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix and is affected by variations in costs related to manufacturing and servicing our products, including our ability to scale our operations efficiently and effectively in response to prevailing business conditions.
changes in gross margin percentage, which are driven by the revenue volume of products and services, reflect our ability to leverage existing infrastructure to generate higher revenues. revenue is impacted by average customer pricing, customer revenue deferrals associated with volume purchase agreements and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. changes in gross margin percentage from the mix of products and services sold reflect the impact of changes within the composition of product and service offerings, and amortization of inventory fair value adjustments from business combinations. changes in gross margin percentage from manufacturing labor, overhead and efficiencies reflect our ability to manage costs and drive productivity as we scale our manufacturing activity to respond to customer requirements, and amortization of intangible assets. changes in gross margin percentage from other service and manufacturing costs include the impact of customer support costs, including the efficiencies with which we deliver services to our customers, and the effectiveness with which we manage our production plans and inventory risk.
the increase in our gross margin from 57.9% to 59.9% during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 is primarily attributable to a higher revenue volume of products and services sold and a more profitable mix of products and services sold, partially offset by an increase in service and manufacturing costs.
(1)    segment gross margin is calculated as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues and excludes corporate allocations and the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, amortization of intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments, and acquisition-related costs. for additional details, refer to note 19 "segment reporting and geographic information" to our consolidated financial statements.
•semiconductor process control segment gross margin increased due to a more profitable mix of products and services sold, partially offset by an increase in service and manufacturing costs.
r&d expenses may fluctuate with product development phases and project timing as well as our r&d efforts. as technological innovation is essential to our success, we may incur significant costs associated with r&d projects, including compensation for engineering talent, engineering material costs and other expenses.
r&d expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses of $54.5 million as a result of additional engineering headcount, higher employee benefit costs, and higher variable compensation and an increase in engineering project materials expenses of $22.6 million. this is partially offset by a decrease in travel-related expense of $11.3 million.
our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. to do this, we believe that we must continue to make substantial and focused investments in our r&d. we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies.
sg&a expenses during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in travel-related expenses of $25.4 million and a decrease in depreciation and intangible amortization expense of $19.3 million. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $19.5 million as the result of additional headcount, higher employee benefit costs and variable compensation, an increase in facility and office expense of $9.7 million, and higher consulting costs of $6.6 million.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing for all reporting units, we recorded $144.2 million and $112.5 million in impairment charges in the specialty semiconductor process and pcb and display reporting units, respectively, in the three months ended march 31, 2020.
for additional information refer to note 20 "restructuring charges" to our consolidated financial statements.
the decrease in interest expense during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 was primarily due to lower interest expense on our revolving credit facility, which is described further in the "liquidity and capital resources" section below.
other expense (income), net is comprised primarily of fair value adjustments and realized gains or losses on sales of marketable and non-marketable securities, gains or losses from revaluations of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as well as foreign currency contracts, interest-related accruals (such as interest and penalty accruals related to our tax obligations) and interest income earned on our invested cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
the decrease in other expense (income), net during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 was primarily due to an initial fair value adjustment of $26.7 million from an equity security becoming marketable.
for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020, loss on extinguishment of debt reflected a pre-tax net loss of $22.5 million associated with the redemption of our $500.0 million of senior notes due 2021, including associated redemption premiums, accrued interest and other fees and expenses.
tax expense was higher as a percentage of income before taxes during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020 primarily due to the impact of the following items:
•tax expense increased by $107.2 million relating to the impact of a decrease in the proportion of kla's earnings generated in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u.s. statutory rate during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021;
•tax expense increased by $41.1 million during the fiscal year ending june 30, 2021 relating to an increase in our deferred tax liability on purchased intangibles due to an increase in the united kingdom statutory income tax rate effective april 2023; and
•tax expense decreased by $44.3 million relating to a decrease in our unrecognized tax benefit during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021; and
our effective tax rate during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019 was impacted by the tax act, which was enacted into law on december 22, 2017. the following items are the tax impacts as a result of the tax act:
•tax expense decreased by $19.3 million relating to the transition tax liability during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019.
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income, the amount of our pre-tax income as business activities fluctuate, non-deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions, r&d credits as a percentage of aggregate pre-tax income, non-taxable or non-deductible increases or decreases in the assets held within our executive deferred savings plan, the tax effects of employee stock activity and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.
in the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world. we are subject to federal income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 and are under u.s. income tax examination for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018. we are subject to u.s. state income tax examinations for all years beginning from the fiscal year ended june 30, 2017. we are also subject to examinations in other major foreign jurisdictions, including singapore and israel, for all years beginning from the calendar year ended december 31, 2012. we are under audit in germany related to orbotech for the calendar years ended december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2015. we have concluded our audit in israel related to kla for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2017 to june 30, 2020. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
in may 2017, orbotech received an assessment from the ita with respect to its fiscal years 2012 through 2014 (the "assessment" and the "audit period," respectively), for an aggregate amount of tax, after offsetting all net operating losses ("nol") available through the end of 2014, of approximately nis 229 million (equivalent to approximately $66 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the israeli consumer price index as of date of the issuance of the tax decrees).
on august 31, 2018, orbotech filed an objection in respect of the tax assessment (the "objection"). the ita completed the second stage of the audit, in which the claims orbotech raised in the objection were examined by different personnel at the ita. in addition, the ita examined additional items during this second stage of the audit. as orbotech and the ita did not reach an agreement during the second stage, the ita issued tax decrees to orbotech on august 28, 2019 ("tax decrees") for an aggregate amount of tax, after offsetting all nols available through the end of 2014, of approximately nis 257 million (equivalent to approximately $73 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the israeli consumer price index as of the date of the issuance of the tax decrees). these tax decrees replaced the assessment. we believe that our recorded unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the resolution of these tax decrees.
orbotech filed a notice of appeal with respect to the above tax decrees with the district court of tel aviv on september 26, 2019. on february 27, 2020 the ita filed its arguments in support of the tax decrees. orbotech filed the grounds of appeal with respect to the above tax decrees on july 30, 2020. we are currently in the pre-trial hearing stage of the process. the ita and orbotech are continuing discussions in an effort to resolve this matter in a mutually agreeable manner.
in connection with the above, there is an ongoing criminal investigation in israel against orbotech, certain of its employees and its tax consultant. on april 11, 2018, orbotech received a "suspect notification letter" (dated march 28, 2018) from the tel aviv district attorney's office (fiscal and financial). in the letter, it was noted that the investigation file was transferred from the assessment investigation officer to the district attorney's office. the letter further states that the district attorney's office has not yet made a decision regarding submission of an indictment against orbotech; and that if after studying the case, a decision is made to consider prosecuting orbotech, orbotech will receive an additional letter, and within 30 days, orbotech may present its arguments to the district attorney's office as to why it should not be indicted. on october 27, 2019, we received a request for additional information from the district attorney's office. we will continue to monitor the progress of the district attorney's office investigation; however, we cannot anticipate when the review of the case will be completed and what will be the results thereof. we intend to cooperate with the district attorney's office to enable them to conclude their investigation.
in december 2020, orbotech received an assessment from the ita with respect to its fiscal years 2015 through 2018 (the "second assessment"), for an aggregate amount of tax, after offsetting all nols available through the end of 2018, of approximately nis 227 million (equivalent to approximately $68 million which includes related interest and linkage differentials to the israeli consumer price index as of date of the issuance of the second assessment). we filed an objection to the second assessment with the ita in march 2021. the objection moved the 2015-2018 audit to the second stage, in which the ita will review the objections. we believe that our recorded unrecognized tax benefits are sufficient to cover the resolution of the second assessment.
on march 27, 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security ("cares act"), which includes several tax relief provisions, was signed into law. as a result of the cares act, we have deferred payment of certain payroll taxes to the u.s. federal government through december 31, 2022 and accelerated the tax deduction of qualified improvement property. the provisions of the cares act do not have a material impact to our liquidity and we are not expecting a material tax refund.

cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities:
as of june 30, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.49 billion, which represents an increase of $514.1 million from june 30, 2020. the increase is mainly due to net cash provided by operating activities of $2.19 billion, partially offset by stock repurchases of $938.6 million, cash used for payments of dividends and dividend equivalents of $559.4 million, net cash usage of $288.1 million related to the purchases, sales and maturities of available-for-sale and trading securities and capital expenditures of $231.6 million.
as of june 30, 2021, $0.96 billion of our $2.49 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. we currently intend to indefinitely reinvest $0.60 billion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries for which we assert that earnings are permanently reinvested. if, however, a portion of these funds were to be repatriated to the united states, we would be required to accrue and pay state and foreign taxes of approximately 1%-22% of the funds repatriated. the amount of taxes due will depend on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the location from which the funds are repatriated. we have accrued state and foreign tax on the remaining cash of $0.36 billion of the $0.96 billion held by our foreign subsidiaries and branch offices. as such, these funds can be returned to the u.s. without accruing any additional u.s. tax expense.
the total amounts of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal years ended june 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $559.4 million, $522.4 million and $469.4 million, respectively. the increase in the amount of regular quarterly cash dividends and dividends equivalents paid during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 reflected the increase in the level of our regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.85 to $0.90 per share that was instituted during the three months ended september 30, 2020. the amounts of accrued dividend equivalents payable for regular quarterly cash dividends on unvested rsus with dividend equivalent rights were $10.3 million and $8.3 million as of june 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. these amounts will be paid upon vesting of the underlying unvested rsus as described in note 10 "equity, long-term incentive compensation plans and non-controlling interest" to our consolidated financial statements.
on august 5, 2021, we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.05 per share. refer to note 21 "subsequent events" to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the declaration of our quarterly cash dividend announced subsequent to june 30, 2021.
the shares repurchased under our stock repurchase program have reduced our basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fiscal years ended june 30, 2021 and 2020. the stock repurchase program is intended, in part, to offset the dilution from our equity incentive plans, shares issued in connection with the purchases under our espp and the issuance of shares in the orbotech acquisition, as well as to return excess cash to our stockholders.
cash flows from operating activities:
we have historically financed our liquidity requirements through cash generated from operations. net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 increased by $0.41 billion compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020, from $1.78 billion to $2.19 billion, primarily as a result of the following factors:
net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 was $500.4 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $258.9 million during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020. this increase in cash used was mainly due to an increase in net purchases of available for sale and trading securities of $270.9 million and an increase in cash paid to purchase fixed assets of $79.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for a business acquisition of $90.1 million and an increase in cash received from sale of a business of $16.8 million.
cash flows from financing activities:
net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021 increased compared to the fiscal year ended june 30, 2020, from $1.30 billion to $1.50 billion. this increase was mainly due to an increase in cash used for stock repurchases of $109.5 million, an increase in net debt repayments of $50.5 million and cash paid for dividends and dividend equivalents of $36.9 million.
in february 2020, s&p upgraded its credit rating of the company to "bbb+" and revised its outlook to stable, which permanently removed interest rate adjustments and the interest rate on the 2014 senior notes became fixed. the interest rates for each series of the 2020 senior notes and 2019 senior notes are not subject to adjustments.
in january 2020, we entered into a series of forward contracts ("2020 rate lock agreements") to lock the 30-year treasury rate (the "benchmark interest rate" with respect to the 2020 rate lock agreements) on a portion of the 2020 senior notes. the 2020 rate lock agreements had a notional amount of $350.0 million in aggregate and matured in the same quarter. the 2020 rate lock agreements were terminated on the date of the pricing of the $750.0 million of 3.300% senior notes due in 2050 and we recorded the fair value of $21.5 million as a loss within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("aoci") as of march 31, 2020, which is being amortized over the life of the debt. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018, we entered into a series of forward contracts (the "2018 rate lock agreements") to lock the benchmark interest rate with notional amount of $500.0 million in aggregate. in october 2014, we entered into a series of forward contracts to lock the 10-year treasury rate (the "benchmark interest rate" with respect to the 2014 rate lock agreements) on a portion of the 2014 senior notes with a notional amount of $1.00 billion in aggregate. for additional details, refer to note 17 "derivative instruments and hedging activities" and note 8 "debt" to our consolidated financial statements.
the original discounts on the 2020 senior notes, the 2019 senior notes and the 2014 senior notes amounted to $0.3 million, $6.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and are being amortized over the life of the debt. interest is payable as follows: semi-annually on march 1 and september 1 of each year for the 2020 senior notes; semi-annually on march 15 and september 15 of each year for the 2019 senior notes; and semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year for the 2014 senior notes. the indenture for the senior notes (the "indenture") includes covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on our facilities and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain allowances under which certain sale and leaseback transactions are not restricted.
in certain circumstances involving a change of control followed by a downgrade of the rating of a series of senior notes by at least two of moody's, s&p and fitch, unless we have exercised our rights to redeem the senior notes of such series, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase all or, at the holder's option, any part, of each holder's senior notes of that series pursuant to the offer described below (the "change of control offer"). in the change of control offer, we will be required to offer payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of senior notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the senior notes repurchased, up to, but not including, the date of repurchase.
as of june 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the indenture associated with the senior notes.
revolving credit facility:
in november 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (the "credit agreement") providing for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility"), which replaced our prior credit facility. subject to the terms of the credit agreement, the revolving credit facility may be increased by an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. in november 2018, we entered into an incremental facility, extension and amendment agreement (the "amendment"), which amended the credit agreement to (a) extend the maturity date (the "maturity date") from november 30, 2022 to november 30, 2023, (b) increase the total commitment by $250.0 million and (c) effect certain other amendments to the credit agreement as set forth in the amendment. after giving effect to the amendment, the total commitments under the credit agreement amount to $1.00 billion. during the fiscal year ended june 30, 2021, we made a principal payment of $50.0 million. as of june 30, 2021, we had no outstanding aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
we may borrow, repay and reborrow funds under the revolving credit facility until the maturity date, at which time such revolving credit facility will terminate, and all outstanding loans under such facility, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, must be repaid. we may prepay outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at any time without a prepayment penalty.
borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest, at our option, at either: (i) the alternative base rate ("abr") plus a spread, which ranges from 0 bps to 75 bps, or (ii) the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a spread, which ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps. the spreads under abr and libor are subject to adjustment in conjunction with credit rating downgrades or upgrades. we are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, which ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps, subject to an adjustment in conjunction with changes to our credit rating. as of june 30, 2021, we elected to pay interest on the borrowed amount under the revolving credit facility at libor plus a spread of 100.0 bps and we pay an annual commitment fee of 10 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility.
the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio as described in the credit agreement, on a quarterly basis, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than 3.50 to 1.00. in addition, we are required to maintain the maximum leverage ratio as described in the credit agreement, on a quarterly basis of 3.00 to 1.00, covering the trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters for each fiscal quarter, which can be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for a period of time in connection with a material acquisition or a series of material acquisitions. as of june 30, 2021, our maximum allowed leverage ratio was 3.00 to 1.00.
we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement as of june 30, 2021 (the interest expense coverage ratio was 18.70 to 1.00 and the leverage ratio was 1.18 to 1.00). considering our current liquidity position, short-term financial forecasts and ability to prepay the revolving credit facility, if necessary, we expect to continue to be in compliance with our financial covenants at the end of our fiscal year ending june 30, 2022.

(2)the interest payments associated with the senior notes payable included in the table above are based on the principal amount multiplied by the applicable interest rate for each series of senior notes. our future interest payments are subject to change if our then effective credit rating is below investment grade as discussed above. the interest payment under the revolving credit facility for the undrawn balance is payable at 10 bps as a commitment fee based on the daily undrawn balance, and we utilized the existing rate for the projected interest payments included in the table above. our future interest payments for the revolving credit facility are subject to change due to any upgrades or downgrades to our then effective credit rating.
(3)represents an estimate of significant commitments to purchase inventory from our suppliers as well as an estimate of significant purchase commitments associated with goods, services and other assets in the ordinary course of business. our obligation under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time-horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties. this forecasted time-horizon can vary among different suppliers. actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided. in addition, the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event the arrangements are renegotiated or canceled. certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties.
(4)represents the estimated income tax payable obligation related to uncertain tax positions as well as related accrued interest. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.
(6)as part of our employee compensation program, we issue cash-based long-term incentive ("cash lti") awards to many of our employees. cash lti awards issued to employees under the cash long-term incentive plan ("cash lti plan") generally vest in three or four equal installments. the amounts in the table above are those committed under the cash lti plan; the expected total payment after estimated forfeitures is approximately $209 million. for additional details, refer to note 10 "equity, long-term incentive compensation plans and non-controlling interest" to our consolidated financial statements.
(7)represents an estimate of expected benefit payments up to fiscal year 2031 that was actuarially determined and excludes the minimum cash required to contribute to the plan. as of june 30, 2021, our defined benefit pension plans do not have material required minimum cash contribution obligations.
(8)represents the amount committed under our non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to the uncertainties in the timing around participant's separation and any potential changes that participants may decide to make to the previous distribution elections.
(9)represents the transition tax liability associated with our deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings resulting from the enactment of the tax act into law on december 22, 2017.
(11)represents amounts committed for accrued dividends payable for quarterly cash dividends for unvested rsus granted with dividend equivalent rights. for additional details, refer to note 10 "equity, long-term incentive compensation plans and non-controlling interest" to our consolidated financial statements.
we have agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our trade receivables and promissory notes from customers without recourse. in addition, we periodically sell certain letters of credit ("lc"), without recourse, received from customers as payment for goods and services.
we maintain guarantee arrangements available through various financial institutions for up to $75.2 million, of which $59.7 million had been issued as of june 30, 2021, primarily to fund guarantees to customs authorities for value-added tax ("vat") and other operating requirements of our subsidiaries in europe, israel, and asia.
working capital:
working capital was $3.59 billion as of june 30, 2021, which represents an increase of $569.3 million compared to our working capital as of june 30, 2020. as of june 30, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $2.49 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. our liquidity may be affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the business, spending for business acquisitions, and other factors such as uncertainty in the global and regional economies and the semiconductor, semiconductor-related and electronic device industries. although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash and cash equivalents balances and our $1.00 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, cash dividends, stock repurchases and other contractual obligations, including repayment of outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months.
our credit ratings as of june 30, 2021 are summarized below:
rating agency        rating fitch                bbb+
in june 2021, moody's upgraded our senior unsecured credit rating from baa1 to a2. factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries, our financial position, material acquisitions and changes in our business strategy.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of june 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position, changes in financial condition, revenues and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. refer to note 16 "commitments and contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements for information related to indemnification obligations.

summary of risk factors as noted above, we are subject to a number of risks that if realized could materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. some of the more significant risks and uncertainties we face include those summarized below. the summary below is not exhaustive and is qualified by reference to the full set of risk factors set forth in this "risk factors" section. please carefully consider all of the information in this form 10-k, including the full set of risks set forth in this "risk factors" section, and in our other filings with the sec before making an investment decision regarding regeneron.
•sales of our products are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, including private payors and government programs such as medicare and medicaid, which could change due to various factors such as drug price control measures that have been or may be introduced in the united states by various federal and state authorities.
•the commercial success of our products is subject to significant competition from products or product candidates that may be superior to, or more cost effective than, our products or product candidates.
•we and our collaborators on which we rely to commercialize some of our marketed products may be unable to continue to successfully commercialize or co-commercialize our products, both in the united states and abroad.
•serious complications or side effects in connection with the use or development of our products or product candidates could cause our regulatory approvals to be revoked or limited or lead to delay or discontinuation of development of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products.
•we may be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial use, which would delay or prevent continued development of such candidates and/or receipt of regulatory approval or commercial sale.
•many of our products are intended to be used in combination with drug-delivery devices, which may result in additional regulatory, commercialization, and other risks.
intellectual property and market exclusivity risks
•we may not be able to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and our patents or other means of defending our intellectual property may be insufficient to protect our proprietary rights.
•patents or proprietary rights of others may restrict our development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization efforts and subject us to patent litigation and other proceedings that could find us liable for damages.
•loss or limitation of patent rights, and regulatory pathways for biosimilar competition, could reduce the duration of market exclusivity for our products, including eylea.
•we rely on limited internal and contracted manufacturing and supply chain capacity, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and to advance our clinical pipeline. as we increase our production in response to higher product demand or in anticipation of a potential regulatory approval, our current manufacturing capacity will likely not be sufficient, and our dependence on our collaborators and/or contract manufacturers may increase, to produce adequate quantities of drug material for both commercial and clinical purposes.
•expanding our manufacturing capacity and establishing fill/finish capabilities will be costly and we may be unsuccessful in doing so in a timely manner, which could delay or prevent the launch and successful commercialization of our products approved for marketing and could jeopardize our clinical development programs.
•our ability to manufacture products may be impaired if any of our or our collaborators' manufacturing activities, or the activities of other third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain, are found to infringe patents of others.
•if sales of our marketed products do not meet the levels currently expected, or if the launch of any of our product candidates is delayed or unsuccessful, we may face costs related to excess inventory or unused capacity at our manufacturing facilities and at the facilities of third parties or our collaborators.
•third-party service or supply failures, failures at our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, or failures at the facilities of any other party participating in the supply chain, would adversely affect our ability to supply our products.
other regulatory and litigation risks
•if the testing or use of our products harms people, or is perceived to harm them even when such harm is unrelated to our products, we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.
•our business activities have been, and may in the future be, challenged under federal or state healthcare laws, which may subject us to civil or criminal proceedings, investigations, or penalties.
•if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions, and fines.
•we face risks from the improper conduct of our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators, including those relating to potential non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act.
•tax liabilities and risks associated with our operations outside of the united states could adversely affect our business.
•if our collaborations with sanofi or bayer are terminated or breached, our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain of our products and product candidates in the time expected, or at all, would be materially harmed.
other risks factors - risks related to employees, information technology, financial results and liquidity, and our common stock
•our business is dependent on our key personnel and will be harmed if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research, development, manufacturing, and commercial organizations.
•significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.
•we may need additional funding in the future, which may not be available to us, and which may force us to delay, reduce, or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
in december 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, sars-cov-2, causing a disease referred to as covid-19, was reported to have surfaced in wuhan, china. it has since spread around the world and caused a global pandemic. this pandemic has adversely affected or has the potential to adversely affect, among other things, the economic and financial markets and labor resources of the countries in which we operate; our manufacturing and supply chain operations, research and development efforts, commercial operations and sales force, administrative personnel, third-party service providers, and business partners and customers; and the demand for our marketed products.
the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in the imposition of various restrictions and mandates around the world to reduce the spread of the disease, including governmental orders that direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence, direct businesses and governmental agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations, prohibit certain non-essential gatherings, maintain social distancing, order cessation of non-essential travel, and require proof of vaccination and/or negative covid-19 test results. the covid-19 pandemic has continued to ebb and flow, with different jurisdictions having higher levels of infections than others and new variants of the sars-cov-2 virus (such as the omicron variant) emerging and spreading more easily and quickly than other variants. as the pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, its ultimate impact is highly uncertain and subject to change and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems, or the global economy as a whole. these effects could have a material impact on our operations.
by way of example, continuation or re-imposition of various government-imposed or private-sector measures relating to the covid-19 pandemic (including those we previously implemented, such as work-from-home policies for some employees) may further negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business, and delay our clinical programs and development timelines beyond the delays we have already experienced and disclosed. such restrictions and limitations may also further negatively impact our access to regulatory authorities (which are affected, among other things, by applicable travel restrictions and may be delayed in responding to inquiries, reviewing filings, and conducting inspections); our ability to perform regularly scheduled quality checks and maintenance; and our ability to obtain services from third-party specialty vendors and other providers or to access their expertise as fully and timely as needed. the covid-19 pandemic may also result in the loss of some of our key personnel, either temporarily or permanently. we and our employees may also be subject to government vaccine mandates, such as president biden's recent executive order entitled "executive order on ensuring adequate covid safety protocols for federal contractors" applicable to certain federal contractors. while enforcement of this mandate is currently enjoined and a similar mandate was recently struck down by the united states supreme court, if this mandate or any similar mandate becomes applicable to us, it may have a negative impact on our ability to retain employees or hire new employees and could adversely impact our business. in addition, our sales and marketing efforts were previously negatively impacted and may be further negatively impacted by postponement or cancellation of face-to-face meetings and restrictions on access by non-essential personnel to hospitals or clinics to the extent such measures slow down adoption or further commercialization of our marketed products. the demand for our marketed products may also be adversely impacted by the restrictions and limitations adopted in response to the covid-19 pandemic, particularly to the extent they affect the patients' ability or willingness to start or continue treatment with our marketed products. any of the foregoing factors may result in lower net product sales of our marketed products. for example, net product sales of eylea in the united states decreased for the three months ended june 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, due in part to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. see part ii, item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations" for a discussion of our net product sales. demand for some or all of our marketed products may be further reduced if shelter-in-place, social distancing, or similar orders remain in effect or are re-implemented and, as a result, some of our inventory may become obsolete and may need to be written off, impacting our operating results. these and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations may materially adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.
various government-imposed or private-sector measures relating to the covid-19 pandemic (or the perception that such restrictions or limitations on the conduct of business operations could occur) previously impacted, and may impact in the future, personnel at our research and manufacturing facilities, our suppliers, and other third parties on which we rely, as well as the availability or cost of materials produced by or purchased from such parties, resulting in supply chain strains or disruptions that may become material. while some materials and services may be obtained from more than one supplier or provider, port closures and other restrictions, whether resulting from the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise (including any government restrictions or limitations, such as those that may be imposed under the defense production act), could materially disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials or services (including fill/finish services) required for the development and manufacturing of our products and product candidates as well as our research efforts. if microbial, viral (including covid-19), or other contaminations are discovered in our products, product candidates, the materials used for their production, or in our facilities, or in the facilities of our collaborators, third-party contract manufacturers, or other providers or suppliers, the affected facilities may need to be closed or may otherwise be affected for an extended period of time, or the contamination may result in other delays or disruptions in our direct or indirect supply chain.
in addition, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths related to covid-19 previously disrupted and may in the future disrupt the united states' healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems. such disruptions could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay, fda review and potential approval of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products. in addition, some of our clinical trials were previously and may in the future be affected by the covid-19 pandemic. this impact could result in further delays in site initiation and patient enrollment due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the covid-19 pandemic, patients' inability to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services, and restrictions on trial initiations imposed by hospitals and other trial sites as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. similarly, our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to covid-19, was previously and may in the future be delayed or disrupted. we continue to evaluate the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic on an individual trial basis. any such disruptions may further negatively impact the progress of our clinical trials, including the readouts of trial results, the timing of regulatory review, and any anticipated program milestones.
while the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the covid-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it previously caused significant disruption of global financial markets and could cause more economic disruption in the future, making it more difficult for us to access capital if needed. in addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of covid-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.
to the extent the covid-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, prospects, operating results, or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this "risk factors" section.
in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we developed regen-cov (known as ronapreve in other countries outside the united states), a novel investigational antibody cocktail treatment designed to prevent and treat infection from the sars-cov-2 virus. regen-cov received an eua from the fda in november 2020 for the treatment of mild to moderate covid-19 in certain patients. however, based on laboratory data that showed markedly decreased binding to the omicron spike protein, regen-cov is highly unlikely to be active against the omicron variant. in january 2022, the fda revised the eua to exclude its use in geographic regions where, based on available information including variant susceptibility and regional variant frequency, infection or exposure is likely due to a variant such as omicron that is not susceptible to the treatment. with this eua revision, regen-cov is not currently authorized for use in any u.s. states, territories, or jurisdictions, since omicron is currently the dominant variant across the united states.
in light of these developments, we cannot predict whether (if at all) or to what extent regen-cov may be reauthorized for use by the fda in any such jurisdictions in the future. in addition, there can be no assurance with respect to how long the eua will remain in effect or whether the eua will be further revised or revoked by the fda based on its determination that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization or other reasons. similar limitations on the use of regen-cov may also be imposed by foreign regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where regen-cov is currently authorized for use. it is also possible that the fda and certain other regulatory authorities may not grant regen-cov full marketing approval for the treatment or prevention of covid-19, or that any such marketing approvals, if granted, may have similar or other significant limitations on its use. further, besides currently available therapeutic and prevention options for covid-19, additional products for treatment or prevention of covid-19 that are more efficacious, more easily administered, more cost-effective, or otherwise superior may be successfully developed; and utilization of regen-cov previously was, and any future utilization may be, adversely impacted by other factors, such as the rollout of vaccines providing acquired immunity against covid-19, other products for treatment or prevention of covid-19, or the distribution model for regen-cov. any of these factors may further negatively impact any potential future uptake or commercialization of regen-cov, and such impact may be material. the intense public interest, including speculation by the media, in the development and commercialization of monoclonal antibodies and other products for treatment or prevention of covid-19 has caused or contributed to significant volatility in our stock price, which may continue as data and other information from any studies evaluating regen-cov (whether conducted by us or others), our "next generation" monoclonal antibodies targeting sars-cov-2 discussed below, and third-party product candidates for the treatment or prevention of covid-19 as well as any other regulatory actions become public. we are also subject to similar risks in connection with the development and potential commercialization of any such "next generation" monoclonal antibodies.
in addition to our regen-cov program, we are progressing "next generation" monoclonal antibodies targeting sars-cov-2 that are active against omicron, delta, and other variants of concern. although, pending regulatory discussions, new therapeutic candidates could enter clinical development in the coming months, there can be no assurance of the timing of commencement or completion of any such future studies or favorable results from any of them.
we also face risks related to our significant investment in the development, supply, allocation, distribution, pricing, and commercialization of regen-cov and our "next generation" monoclonal antibodies (together with regen-cov referred to below as "our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies"). given the severity and urgency of the covid-19 pandemic, we have committed and expect to continue to commit significant capital and resources to fund and supply clinical trials and to accelerate and scale up the production of our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies, which involves a complex manufacturing process that is both resource- and time-sensitive. we expect our investment in the development and manufacture of our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies to continue through 2022 and potentially beyond, although the magnitude of our investment will be subject to clinical data results, the duration of the covid-19 pandemic, and other factors, including regulatory outcomes. if we are unable to obtain a new eua for any of our "next generation" monoclonal antibodies, or obtain regulatory approvals for any of the foregoing, or if we make a strategic decision to discontinue development of our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies or are otherwise not successful in their commercialization, we may be unable to recoup our significant expenses incurred to date and/or in the future related to the development and production of our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies. while we previously recognized significant revenues in connection with sales of regen-cov, the degree to which future sales of our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies will continue to impact our results of operations is highly uncertain.
in addition, our internal and contracted manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient to cover any potential future demand for our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies. while we have entered into a collaboration agreement with roche to develop, manufacture, and distribute outside the united states regen-cov, we cannot be certain that our current manufacturing and distribution capacity for regen-cov and the increased manufacturing and distribution capacity through our collaboration with roche will be sufficient if there is significant future demand for regen-cov. in addition, we rely entirely on third parties for filling and finishing services for regen-cov and, in the future, may rely entirely on such providers for filling and finishing services for our other covid-19 monoclonal antibodies. our third-party fill/finish providers may not have sufficient capacity or may otherwise not be able to provide such services on a timely basis in the quantities requested (such as because they devote their capacity to other drugs or vaccines against covid-19), which we previously experienced. the ability of our third-party providers to deliver such services to us may further be adversely impacted by the imposition of government restrictions or limitations (including those that may be imposed under the defense production act). if we are unable to timely enter into alternative arrangements, or if such alternative arrangements are not available on satisfactory terms or at all, we may experience delays in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies.
we and roche have faced and may in the future face additional challenges related to the allocation of supply of regen-cov and other covid-19 monoclonal antibodies (as applicable), particularly with respect to geographic distribution. for example, if supplies of regen-cov are constrained in response to future demand, it is possible that the u.s. government may limit or restrict our and/or roche's ability to distribute and commercialize regen-cov outside the united states. in addition, as a result of the emergency situations in many countries, there is a heightened risk that products for treatment or prevention of covid-19 may be subject to adverse governmental actions in certain countries. the u.s. government may exercise or assert certain rights with respect to our inventions, products, or product candidates. for example, under the defense production act, the u.s. government may, among other things, require domestic industries to provide essential goods and services needed for the national defense, such as drug material or other supplies needed to treat covid-19 patients, which could require us to allocate manufacturing capacity in a way that impacts our regular operations. in addition, our agreements with the u.s. government contain provisions granting the u.s. government certain rights relating to products, product candidates, and related inventions (as applicable) covered by those agreements. for example, our july 2020 agreement with the u.s. government to manufacture and deliver regen-cov to the u.s. government gives the u.s. government, among other rights, the right to require us to grant a non-exclusive license to applicable inventions to a third party if such action is deemed necessary to alleviate certain health or safety needs. this right may be triggered if we, for example, do not manufacture or supply sufficient product to address such needs. if the u.s. government exercises or asserts any such rights or imposes these or similar measures with respect to our products, product candidates, or related inventions (including our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies), it may adversely impact our business and results of operations. foreign governments (including the government of ireland, where we have manufacturing facilities) may have similar rights or attempt to assert any such rights. further, we have observed and are likely to continue to face significant public attention and scrutiny over the complex decisions made regarding the development program for our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies, including any allocation, distribution, or pricing decisions. if we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face significant reputational harm, which could, among other adverse consequences, negatively affect our stock price.
eylea net sales represent a substantial portion of our revenues and this concentration of our net sales in a single product makes us substantially dependent on that product. for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, eylea net sales in the united states represented 36% and 58% of our total revenues, respectively, with eylea net sales as a percentage of our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2021 being significantly lower due to the net product sales of regen-cov we recorded in that period in connection with deliveries of drug product under our agreements with the u.s. government. if we were to experience difficulty with the commercialization of eylea in the united states or if bayer were to experience any difficulty with the commercialization of eylea outside the united states (including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic discussed above), or if we and bayer are unable to maintain current marketing approvals of eylea, we may experience a reduction in revenue and may not be able to sustain profitability, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed.
in addition, we are dependent on our share of profits from the commercialization of dupixent under our antibody collaboration with sanofi. if we or sanofi were to experience any difficulty with the commercialization of dupixent or if we or sanofi are unable to maintain current marketing approvals of dupixent, we may experience a reduction in revenue and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed.
if we or our collaborators are unable to continue to successfully commercialize our products, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition will be materially harmed.
•the continued impact of sars-cov-2 (the virus that has caused the covid-19 pandemic) on our business and the demand for our marketed products, as well as its continued impact on, among other things, our employees, collaborators, suppliers, and other third parties on which we rely, our ability to continue to manage our supply chain, and the global economy (as further discussed above under "risks related to the covid-19 pandemic - our business may be further adversely affected by the effects of the covid-19 pandemic");

•the outcome of the pending proceedings relating to eylea, dupixent, praluent, and regen-cov (described further in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report), as well as other risks relating to our marketed products and product candidates associated with intellectual property of other parties and pending or future litigation relating thereto (as discussed under "risks related to intellectual property and market exclusivity" below);
we and our collaborators are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight with respect to the products we or our collaborators commercialize. if we or our collaborators fail to maintain regulatory compliance for any of such products, the applicable marketing approval may be withdrawn, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
we and our collaborators are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight with respect to the products we or they commercialize for the products' currently approved indications in the united states, eu, and other countries where such products are approved. if we or our collaborators fail to maintain regulatory compliance or satisfy other obligations for such products' currently approved indications (including because the product does not meet the relevant endpoints of any required post-approval studies (such as those required under an accelerated approval by the fda or other similar type of approval), or for any of the reasons discussed below under "risks related to maintaining approval of our marketed products and the development and obtaining approval of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products - obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for drug products is costly, time-consuming, and highly uncertain"), the applicable marketing approval may be withdrawn, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. failure to comply may also subject us to sanctions, product recalls, or withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications. see also "risks related to manufacturing and supply - our or our collaborators' failure to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of drug products or product candidates could result in incurring substantial remedial costs, delays in the development or approval of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products and/or in their commercial launch if regulatory approval is obtained, and a reduction in sales" below.
sales of our marketed products are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
sales of our marketed products in the united states are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, including private payor healthcare and insurance programs, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit management companies ("pbms"), and government programs such as medicare and medicaid. sales of our marketed products in other countries are dependent, in large part, on similar reimbursement mechanisms and programs in those countries.
our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected in a material manner if such third-party payors do not adequately defray or reimburse the cost of our marketed products to patients. if these entities do not provide coverage and reimbursement with respect to our marketed products or provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, such products may be too costly for many patients to afford them, and physicians may not prescribe them. many third-party payors cover only selected drugs, or may prefer selected drugs, making drugs that are not covered or preferred by such payors more expensive for patients. third-party payors may also require prior authorization for reimbursement, or require failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug, particularly with respect to higher-priced drugs. as our currently marketed products and most of our product candidates are biologics, bringing them to market may cost more than bringing traditional, small-molecule drugs to market due to the complexity associated with the research, development, production, supply, and regulatory review of such products. given cost sensitivities in many health care systems (which will likely be exacerbated as a result of the covid-19
pandemic), our currently marketed products and product candidates are likely to be subject to continued pricing pressures, which may have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
in addition, in order for private insurance and governmental payors (such as medicare and medicaid in the united states) to reimburse the cost of our marketed products, we must maintain, among other things, our fda registration and our national drug code, formulary approval by pbms, and recognition by insurance companies and cms. there is no certainty that we will be able to obtain or maintain the applicable requirements for reimbursement (including relevant formulary coverage, as discussed further below) of our current and future marketed products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
government and other third-party payors (including pbms) are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting, and attempting to limit, both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs, such as by requiring outcomes-based or other pay-for-performance pricing arrangements. they are also imposing restrictions on eligible patient populations and the reimbursement process, including by means of required prior authorizations and utilization management criteria, such as step therapy (i.e., requiring the use of less costly medications before more costly medications are approved for coverage). some states are also considering legislation that would control the prices and reimbursement of prescription drugs, and state medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any prescription drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. it is likely that federal and state legislatures and health agencies will continue to focus on additional health care reform measures in the future that will impose additional constraints on prices and reimbursements for our marketed products; this trend may be further accelerated as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
further, there have been several recent u.s. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation and policies (in addition to those already in effect) designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. president biden and various members of his administration and the current u.s. congress have indicated that lowering drug prices continues to be a legislative and political priority, as evidenced, for example, by the "executive order on promoting competition in the american economy" issued by president biden in july 2021. the main proposal aimed at drug pricing introduced at the federal level as part of the "build back better act" includes measures that would allow the government to negotiate prices of certain prescription drugs under medicare (including those covered under medicare part b, such as eylea) and would redesign the medicare part d benefit to limit patient out-of-pocket drug costs and shift liabilities among stakeholders, including manufacturers. at the state level, legislatures are becoming increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and price and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. in some cases, these measures are designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from u.s. government programs (including as a result of the proposals, initiatives, and developments described above) could have a material adverse effect on the sales of eylea or our other marketed products. economic pressure on state budgets may also have a similar impact.
in addition, pbms often develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications. the breadth of the products covered by formularies varies considerably from one pbm to another. failure to be included in such formularies or to achieve favorable formulary status may negatively impact the utilization and market share of our marketed products. if our marketed products are not included within an adequate number of formularies, adequate reimbursement levels are not provided, the eligible insured patient population for our products is limited, or a key payor refuses to provide reimbursement for our products in a particular jurisdiction altogether, this could have a material adverse effect on our and our collaborators' ability to commercialize the applicable product.
in certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage, and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control, and we and our collaborators may be unable to obtain coverage, pricing, and/or reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us or necessary for us or our collaborators to successfully commercialize our marketed products in those countries. in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. the requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country, and may take into account the clinical effectiveness, cost, and service impact of existing, new, and emerging drugs and treatments. for example, the eu provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. a member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. our results of operations may suffer if we or our collaborators are unable to market our products in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our marketed products in foreign countries is limited or delayed.
the commercial success of our products and product candidates is subject to significant competition.
marketed products there is substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries from biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and chemical companies. many of our competitors have substantially greater research, preclinical and clinical product development and manufacturing capabilities, as well as financial, marketing, and human resources, than we do. our competitors, regardless of their size, may also enhance their competitive position if they acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative arrangements, or merge with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. there is significant actual and potential future competition for each of our marketed products.
eylea faces significant competition in the marketplace. for example, eylea competes in one or more of its approved indications with other vegf inhibitors, including novartis and genentech/roche's lucentis, novartis' beovu, and genentech/roche's susvimo, as well as samsung bioepis and biogen's biosimilar referencing lucentis. in addition, genentech/roche recently announced the approval of vabysmotm (faricimab-svoa), a bispecific antibody targeting both vegf and ang2, for the treatment of wet amd and dme in the united states. ophthalmologists are also using off-label, third-party repackaged versions of genentech/roche's approved vegf antagonist, bevacizumab, for the treatment of certain of eylea's indications, and we are aware of another company developing an ophthalmic formulation of such product. in dme and rvo, eylea also competes with intravitreal implants of corticosteroids. we are also aware of a number of companies working on the development of product candidates and extended delivery devices for the potential treatment of one or more of eylea's indications, including those that act by blocking vegf and vegf receptors (including therapies designed to extend the treatment interval) and/or other targets. in addition, we are aware of several companies developing biosimilar versions of eylea and other approved anti-vegf treatments. other potentially competitive products in development include products for use in combination with eylea and/or other anti-vegf treatments, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, gene therapies, and other eye-drop formulations, devices, and oral therapies. there also is a risk that third parties repackage zaltrap for off-label use and sale for the treatment of diseases of the eye, even though zaltrap has not been manufactured and formulated for use in intravitreal injections. we are aware of claims by third parties, including those based on published clinical data, alleging that zaltrap may be safely administered to the eye.
the market for dupixent's current and potential future indications is also increasingly competitive. in atopic dermatitis, there are several topical ointments or agents either approved or in development. there are also topical and systemic jak inhibitors and an antibody against il-13 approved for atopic dermatitis and others are in development. in addition, a number of companies are developing antibodies against il-13ra1, ox40, il-31r, and/or il-1alpha. in asthma, competitors to dupixent include antibodies against the il-5 ligand or the il-5 receptor, immunoglobulin e, or thymic stromal lymphopoietin ("tslp"); and some of these antibodies are either approved or in development for indications that also compete or may compete in the future with dupixent in crswnp. there are several other potentially competitive products in development that may compete with dupixent in asthma, as well as potential future indications, including antibodies against the il-33 ligand or receptor. dupixent also faces competition from inhaled products in asthma and potential future indications.
libtayo also faces significant competition. there are several competitors that are marketing and/or developing antibodies against pd-1 and/or pdl-1 (some of which were approved in the relevant indications and commercialized before libtayo), including merck's keytruda, bristol-myers squibb's opdivo, roche's tecentriq, and astrazeneca's imfinzi.
there is also significant actual and potential future competition for other products marketed or otherwise commercialized by us and/or our collaborators under our collaboration agreements with them. for example, there are several companies that are marketing and/or developing antibodies or other molecules (such as small interfering rna molecules, or sirnas) against pcsk9, angptl3 and il-6 and/or il-6r, which currently (or, for product candidates in development, may in the future if approved) compete with praluent, evkeeza, and kevzara, respectively.
product candidates our velocimmune technology, other antibody generation technologies, and late-stage and earlier-stage clinical candidates face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various technologies, including antibody generation technologies and other approaches such as rnai, chimeric antigen receptor t cell (car-t cell), and gene therapy technologies. for example, we are aware of other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in the research and development of antibody-based products against targets that are also the targets of our early- and late-stage product candidates. we are also aware of other companies developing or marketing small molecules or other treatments that may compete with our antibody-based product candidates in various indications, if such product candidates obtain regulatory approval in those indications. if any of these or other competitors announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory agency for a competitive product, such developments may have an adverse effect on our business or future prospects. in addition, the first product to reach the market in a therapeutic area is often at a significant competitive advantage relative to later entrants to the market. accordingly, the relative speed with which we, or our collaborators, can develop our product candidates, complete the clinical trials and approval processes, and, if such product candidates are approved for marketing and sale, supply commercial quantities to the market is expected to continue to be an important competitive factor. due to the uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for a product against any particular target, which may have a material adverse effect on our business or future prospects.
we rely on our collaborations with bayer and sanofi for commercializing some of our marketed products.
while we have established our own sales and marketing organization for eylea in the united states for its currently approved indications, we have no sales, marketing, commercial, or distribution capabilities for eylea outside the united states. under the terms of our license and collaboration agreement with bayer (which is terminable by bayer at any time upon six or twelve months' advance notice, depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination), we rely on bayer (and, in japan, santen pursuant to a co-promotion and distribution agreement with bayer's japanese affiliate, as in effect from time to time) for sales, marketing, and distribution of eylea in countries outside the united states.
in addition, under the terms of our antibody collaboration and our io collaboration, we and sanofi co-commercialize dupixent and libtayo in the united states. as a result, we rely in part on sanofi's sales and marketing organization in the united states for these products. if we and sanofi fail to coordinate our united states sales and marketing efforts effectively, sales of any of such products may be materially affected. sanofi also maintains other important responsibilities relating to dupixent in the united states. for example, sanofi records product sales for dupixent in the united states and leads negotiations with payors relating to this product. we also rely on sanofi for sales, marketing, and distribution of dupixent and libtayo in countries outside the united states. while we exercised our option under the antibody collaboration to co-commercialize dupixent in certain jurisdictions outside the united states and have commenced this co-commercialization, we will continue to rely in part on sanofi's sales and marketing organization in such jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully conduct such co-commercialization in the expected time frame or at all.
if we and our collaborators are unsuccessful in continuing to commercialize the marketed products subject to such collaborations, or if bayer or sanofi terminate their respective collaborations with us, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially impaired. we have limited commercial capabilities outside the united states and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities. therefore, termination of the bayer collaboration agreement, our antibody collaboration, or our io collaboration would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful commercialization of the applicable products, particularly outside the united states. for additional information regarding our collaborations with bayer and sanofi, see "risks related to our reliance on third parties - if our collaboration with bayer for eylea is terminated, or bayer materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and our ability to continue to develop eylea and commercialize eylea outside the united states in the time expected, or at all, would be materially harmed" below and "risks related to our reliance on third parties - if our antibody collaboration or our io collaboration with sanofi is terminated, or sanofi materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain of our products and product candidates in the time expected, or at all, would be materially harmed" below.
our sales of products we commercialize in the united states and our collaborators' sales of products they commercialize or co-commercialize with us under our collaboration agreements with them in the united states and other countries (which impact our share of any profits or losses from the commercialization of these products under the relevant collaboration agreements and, therefore, our results of operations) may be reduced if the applicable product is imported into those countries from lower priced markets, whether legally or illegally (a practice known as parallel trading or reimportation). parallel traders (who may repackage or otherwise alter the original product or sell it through alternative channels such as mail order or the internet) take advantage of the price differentials between markets arising from factors including sales costs, market conditions (such as intermediate trading stages), tax rates, or national regulation of prices. under our arrangement with bayer, pricing and reimbursement for eylea outside the united states is the responsibility of bayer. similarly, under our antibody collaboration and io collaboration with sanofi, pricing and reimbursement for the products commercialized or co-commercialized thereunder outside the united states are the responsibility of sanofi. prices for our marketed products in jurisdictions outside the united states are based on local market economics and competition and are likely to differ from country to country. in the united states, prices for pharmaceuticals are generally higher than in the bordering nations of canada and mexico and sales of our marketed products in the united states may be reduced if the applicable product marketed in those bordering nations is imported into the united states. in addition, there are proposals to legalize the import of pharmaceuticals from outside the united states into the united states. if such proposals were implemented, our future revenues derived from sales of our marketed products could be reduced. parallel-
we may be unsuccessful in continuing the commercialization of our marketed products or in commercializing our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, if approved, which would materially and adversely affect our business, profitability, and future prospects.
even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates for a specific disease and the necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial success of any of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products will depend upon, among other things, their acceptance by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors and on our and our collaborators' ability to successfully manufacture, market, and distribute those products in substantial commercial quantities or to establish and manage the required infrastructure to do so, including large-scale information technology systems and a large-scale distribution network. establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications, if they are not successfully commercialized, we will not be able to recover the significant investment we have made in developing such products and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be severely harmed.
the commercial success of our products may also be adversely affected by guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators, payors, and patient communities that result in decreased use of our products. such guidelines or recommendations may be published not only by governmental agencies, but also professional societies, practice management groups, private foundations, and other interested parties.
our product candidates are delivered either by intravenous infusion or by intravitreal or subcutaneous injections, which are generally less well received by patients than tablet or capsule delivery and this could adversely affect the commercial success of those products if they receive marketing approval.
we sell our marketed products for which we record net product sales in the united states to several distributors and specialty pharmacies, as applicable, which generally sell the product directly to healthcare providers or other pharmacies (as applicable). for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, our gross product sales of such products to two customers accounted on a combined basis for 48% and 83% of our total gross product revenue, respectively, and gross product sales of regen-cov to the u.s. government accounted for an additional 43% of our gross product revenue for the year ended december 31, 2021. we expect significant customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future, although the degree to which future sales of regen-cov will continue to impact our results of operations is highly uncertain. our ability to generate and grow sales of these products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our distributors and specialty pharmacies are able to provide adequate distribution of these products to healthcare providers. although we believe we can find additional distributors, if necessary, our revenue during any period of disruption could suffer and we might incur additional costs. in addition, these customers are responsible for a significant portion of our net trade accounts receivable balances. the loss of any large customer, a significant reduction in sales we make to them, any cancellation of orders they have made with us, or any failure to pay for the products we have shipped to them could adversely affect our results of operations.
if we are unable to establish commercial capabilities outside the united states for products we intend to commercialize or co-commercialize outside the united states, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.
we have limited commercial capabilities outside the united states and do not currently have a fully established organization for the sales, marketing, and distribution of marketed products outside the united states. we will need to establish commercial capabilities outside the united states for any new product we decide to commercialize or co-commercialize outside the united states. for example, following the exercise of our option under the antibody collaboration to co-commercialize dupixent in certain jurisdictions outside the united states, we have begun establishing commercial capabilities for dupixent in such jurisdictions. there may be other circumstances in which we need to establish commercial capabilities outside the united states, including because we decide to commercialize a particular product independently; we are unable to find an appropriate collaborator; or our existing collaborator decides not to opt in, decides to opt out, or breaches its obligations to us with respect to a particular product.
in order to commercialize or co-commercialize any products outside the united states, we must build our sales, marketing, distribution, managerial, and other non-technical capabilities in the relevant markets or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, any of which will likely be expensive and time consuming and could delay product launch or the co-
commercialization of a product in one or more markets outside the united states. we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop commercial capabilities outside the united states (including as it relates to dupixent) within an acceptable time frame, without incurring substantial expenses, or at all. these and other difficulties relating to commercializing our products outside the united states may severely harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
risks related to maintaining approval of our marketed products and the development and obtaining approval of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products if we or our collaborators do not maintain regulatory approval for our marketed products, and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, we will not be able to market or sell them, which would materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
we cannot sell or market products without regulatory approval. if we or our collaborators do not maintain regulatory approval for our marketed products, and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications of our marketed products (or are materially delayed in doing so), the value of our company and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.
in the united states, we (which, for purposes of this risk factor, includes our collaborators, unless otherwise stated or required by the context) must obtain and maintain approval from the fda for each drug we intend to sell. obtaining fda approval is typically a lengthy and expensive process, and approval is highly uncertain. we cannot predict with certainty if or when we might submit for regulatory approval for any of our product candidates currently under development. any approvals we may obtain may not cover all of the clinical indications for which we are seeking approval. also, an approval might contain significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings, precautions, or contra-indications with respect to conditions of use. additionally, the fda may determine that a rems is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks, and the product can therefore be approved. a rems may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the fda considers necessary for the safe use of the drug. the fda has substantial discretion in the approval process (including with respect to setting specific conditions for submission) and may either refuse to accept an application for substantive review or may form the opinion after review of an application that the application is insufficient to allow approval of a product candidate. if the fda does not accept our application for review or approve our application, it may require that we conduct additional clinical, preclinical, or manufacturing validation studies and submit the data before it will reconsider our application. depending on the extent of these or any other studies that might be required, approval of any applications that we submit may be delayed significantly, or we may be required to expend more resources. it is also possible that any such additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the fda to make our applications approvable. if any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to delay or abandon our applications for approval.
in certain instances (such as when we use a biomarker-based test to identify and enroll specific patients in a clinical trial), regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic to our therapeutic product candidate may be required as a condition to regulatory approval of the therapeutic product candidate. we may need to rely on third parties to provide companion diagnostics for use with our product candidates. such third parties may be unable or unwilling on terms acceptable to us to provide such companion diagnostics or to obtain timely regulatory approval of such companion diagnostics, which could negatively impact regulatory approval of our product candidates or may result in increased development costs or delays.
the fda may also require us to conduct additional clinical trials after granting approval of a product. its ability to do so has been enhanced by the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007, pursuant to which the fda has the explicit authority to require postmarketing studies (also referred to as post-approval or phase 4 studies), labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with fda-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. post-approval studies, whether conducted by us or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agencies or voluntary, and other data about our marketed products (or data about products similar to our marketed products that implicate an entire class of products or are perceived to do so) may result in changes in product labeling, restrictions on use, product withdrawal or recall, loss of approval, or lower sales of our products. obligations equivalent in scope, but which can vary widely in application, apply in foreign countries.
according to the fda policies under the prescription drug user fee act, the fda system of review times for new drugs includes standard review and priority review. the fda's goal for a standard review is to review the application within a 10-month time frame from the time the application is filed by the fda (filing date), which typically occurs approximately 60 days following submission of the application by the applicant. the fda has stated the goal to act on 90% of standard new molecular entity ("nme") new drug application ("nda") and original bla submissions within 10 months of the filing date. a priority review designation is given to drugs that treat a serious condition and offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, and may also be afforded to a human drug application based on a priority review voucher. the fda has stated the goal to act on 90% of priority nme nda and original bla submissions within six months of the filing date. however, the fda's review goals are subject to change and the duration of the fda's review depends on a number of factors, including the number and types of other applications that are submitted to the fda around the same time period or are pending. even if any of our applications receives a priority review designation, we may not ultimately be able to obtain approval of our application within a time frame consistent with the fda's stated review goals or at all, and such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process. procedures that are equivalent in scope, but which can vary widely in application, apply in foreign countries.
the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities enforce gcps and other regulations and legal requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical research organizations ("cros"), principal investigators, and trial sites. if we or any of the third parties conducting our clinical studies are determined to have failed to fully comply with gcps, the study protocol or applicable regulations, the clinical data generated in those studies may be deemed unreliable. this and similar instances of non-compliance with gcps could result in non-approval of our product candidates by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities such as the ec, or we or the fda or such other regulatory authorities may decide to conduct additional inspections or require additional clinical studies, which would delay our development programs, require us to incur additional costs, and could substantially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
before approving a new drug or biologic product, the fda and such comparable foreign regulatory authorities require that the facilities at which the product will be manufactured or advanced through the supply chain be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cgmp, requirements and regulations governing the manufacture, shipment, and storage of the product. additionally, manufacturers of biological products and their facilities are subject to payment of substantial user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cgmp regulations and adherence to any commitments made in the applicable bla. these cgmp requirements and regulations are not prescriptive instructions on how to manufacture products, but rather a series of principles that must be observed during manufacturing; as a result, their implementation may not be clearly delineated and may present a challenging task. manufacturing product candidates in compliance with these regulatory requirements is complex, time-consuming, and expensive. to be successful, our products must be manufactured in compliance with regulatory requirements, and at competitive costs. if we or any of our third-party manufacturers, product packagers, labelers, or other parties performing steps in the supply chain are unable to maintain regulatory compliance with cgmp, the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities can impose monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions, including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing approval. for additional information, see "risks related to manufacturing and supply - our or our collaborators' failure to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of drug products or product candidates could result in incurring substantial remedial costs, delays in the development or approval of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products and/or in their commercial launch if regulatory approval is obtained, and a reduction in sales." our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed as a result of noncompliance with the requirements and regulations described in this paragraph.
we are also subject to ongoing requirements imposed by the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping, and reporting of safety and other post-marketing information. the holder of an approved bla or foreign equivalent is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the bla. the holder of an approved bla or foreign equivalent must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. advertising and promotional materials must comply with fda regulations and those of foreign regulatory authorities and may be subject to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. the applicable regulations in countries outside the u.s. grant similar powers to the competent authorities and impose similar obligations on companies.
in addition to the standard drug approval process, the secretary of hhs may authorize the issuance of, and the fda commissioner may issue, an eua to allow an unapproved medical product to be used in an emergency based on criteria established by the food, drug, and cosmetic act, including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing serious or life-threatening diseases when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. for example, regen-cov has been authorized for use in certain individuals in the united states based on an eua from the fda. an eua terminates when the emergency determination underlying the eua terminates. the fda may also revoke, revise, or restrict an eua for a variety of reasons, including where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization or the medical product is no longer effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the underlying health emergency. for example, in january 2022, the fda revised the eua for regen-cov to exclude its use in geographic regions where, based on available information including variant susceptibility and regional variant frequency, infection or exposure is likely due to a variant such as omicron that is not susceptible to the treatment. with this eua revision, regen-cov is not currently authorized for use in any u.s. states, territories, or jurisdictions, since omicron is currently the dominant variant across the united states. any such termination, revocation, or revision of an eua could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways, including by having to absorb related manufacturing and overhead costs as well as potential inventory write-offs if regulatory approval is not obtained timely or at all. for example, during the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a charge of $231.7 million to write down regen-cov inventory, as described in part ii, item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations."
in addition to the fda and other regulatory agency regulations in the united states, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing and approval of drugs, and commercial sale and distribution of drugs in foreign countries. the foreign regulatory approval process is similarly a lengthy and expensive process, the result of which is highly uncertain, and foreign regulatory requirements include all of the risks associated with fda approval as well as country specific regulations. we and our collaborators must maintain regulatory compliance for the products we or they commercialize in foreign jurisdictions. from time to time, we may hold a product's marketing approval in a jurisdiction outside the united states where we may have less experience and where our regulatory capabilities may be more limited. in addition, actions by a regulatory agency in a country or region with respect to a product candidate may have an impact on the approval process for that product candidate in another country or region. foreign regulatory authorities may ask for additional data in order to begin a clinical study, including phase 3 clinical trials required to submit a maa in the eu. in addition such authorities often have the authority to require post-approval studies, such as a pass and/or paes, which involve various risks similar to those described above. whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product in the united states, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries before we can market that product or any other product in those countries.
furthermore, in the eea, if we do not manage to retain a qppv, to maintain a psmf, or to comply with other pharmacovigilance obligations, we may be at risk of our clinical trials being closed prematurely, our marketing authorization being suspended, and we may be subject to other enforcement actions by the national competent authorities of the eea or the ec.
the exact requirements concerning pharmacovigilance reporting may differ in the numerous countries in which we conduct clinical trials. failure to comply with the related pharmacovigilance requirements may result in the premature closure of the clinical trials and other enforcement actions by the relevant regulatory authorities.
as described above, we must conduct extensive testing of our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products before we can obtain regulatory approval to market and sell them. we need to conduct both preclinical animal testing and human clinical trials. conducting such studies is a lengthy, time-consuming, and expensive process. these tests and trials may not achieve favorable results for many reasons, including, among others, failure of the product candidate to demonstrate safety or efficacy, the development of serious or life-threatening adverse events (or side effects) caused by or connected with exposure to the product candidate (or prior or concurrent exposure to other products or product candidates), difficulty in enrolling and maintaining subjects in a clinical trial, clinical trial design that may not make it possible to enroll or retain a sufficient number of patients to achieve a statistically significant result or the desired level of statistical significance for the endpoint in question, lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate or comparator drug, and the failure of clinical investigators, trial monitors, contractors, consultants, or trial subjects to comply with the trial plan, protocol, or applicable regulations related to the fda's glps or gcps. a clinical trial may also fail because the dose(s) of the investigational drug included in the trial were either too low or too high to determine the optimal effect of the investigational drug in the disease setting.
we will need to reevaluate any drug candidate that does not test favorably and either conduct new studies, which are expensive and time consuming, or abandon that drug development program. if preclinical testing yields unfavorable results, product candidates may not advance to clinical trials. the failure of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our clinical candidates for the desired indication(s) would preclude the successful development of those candidates for such indication(s), in which event our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.
furthermore, some of our products and product candidates (such as libtayo and dupixent) are studied in combination with agents and treatments developed by us or our collaborators. there may be additional risks and unforeseen safety issues resulting from such combined administration, any of which may materially adversely impact clinical development of these product candidates and our ability to obtain regulatory approval.
in some jurisdictions such as the eu, initiating phase 3 clinical trials and clinical trials in the pediatric population is subject to a requirement to obtain approval or a waiver from the competent authorities of the eu member states and/or the ema. if we do not obtain such approval, our ability to conduct clinical trials and obtain marketing authorizations or approvals may be severely impaired and our business may be adversely impacted.
certain of our research and development activities are conducted at our existing facilities primarily located in tarrytown, new york. as we continue to expand, we may lease, operate, purchase, or construct additional facilities to expand our research and development capabilities in the future. expanding our research and laboratory facilities may require significant time and resources. further, we may be unable to pursue our research and development efforts if the relevant facility were to cease operations due to fire, climate change, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, or other disruptions. any related delays may interfere with our research and development efforts and our business may be adversely impacted.
only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. clinical trials may not demonstrate statistically sufficient effectiveness and safety to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for these product candidates in these indications. many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry, including our company, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising results had been obtained in earlier trials. in a number of instances, we have terminated the development of product candidates due to a lack of or only modest effectiveness, and clinical trials evaluating our product candidates failed to meet the relevant endpoints. moreover, even if we obtain positive results from preclinical testing or clinical trials, we may not achieve the same success in future trials, or the fda and analogous foreign regulatory authorities may deem the results insufficient for an approval.
many of our clinical trials are conducted under the oversight of idmcs. these independent oversight bodies are made up of external experts who review the progress of ongoing clinical trials, including available safety and efficacy data, and make recommendations concerning a trial's continuation, modification, or termination based on interim, unblinded data. any of our ongoing clinical trials may be discontinued or amended in response to recommendations made by responsible idmcs based on their review of such interim trial results. for example, in august 2020, we discontinued actively treating patients with fasinumab (which at such time only involved dosing in an optional second-year extension phase of one trial) following a recommendation from the responsible idmc that the program be terminated based on available evidence to date. the recommended termination or material modification of any of our ongoing late-stage clinical trials by an idmc could negatively impact the future development of our product candidate(s), and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.
we are studying our product candidates in a wide variety of indications in clinical trials. many of these trials are exploratory studies designed to evaluate the safety profile of these compounds and to identify what diseases and uses, if any, are best suited for these product candidates. these product candidates may not demonstrate the requisite efficacy and/or safety profile to support continued development for some or all of the indications that are being, or are planned to be, studied, which would diminish our clinical "pipeline" and could negatively affect our future prospects and the value of our company.
serious complications or side effects in connection with the use of our products and in clinical trials for our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products could cause our regulatory approvals to be revoked or limited or lead to delay or discontinuation of development of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, which could severely harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
during the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor. often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the drug candidate being studied caused these conditions. various illnesses, injuries, and discomforts have been reported from time-to-time during clinical trials of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products. it is possible that as we test our drug candidates or new indications in larger, longer, and more extensive clinical programs, or as use of these drugs becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, and discomforts that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by patients. many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational drugs are tested in large-scale, phase 3 clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients after approval. if additional clinical experience indicates that any of our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products has many side effects or causes serious or life-threatening side effects, the development of the product candidate may be delayed or fail, or, if the product candidate has received regulatory approval, such approval may be revoked, which would severely harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
with respect to eylea and aflibercept 8 mg, there are many potential safety concerns associated with significant blockade of vegf that may limit our ability to further successfully commercialize eylea and to obtain regulatory approval for aflibercept 8 mg. these serious and potentially life-threatening risks, based on clinical and preclinical experience of vegf inhibitors, include bleeding, intestinal perforation, hypertension, proteinuria, congestive heart failure, heart attack, and stroke. other vegf blockers have reported side effects that became evident only after large-scale trials or after marketing approval when large numbers of patients were treated. there are risks inherent in the intravitreal administration of drugs like aflibercept (such as intraocular inflammation ("ioi"), sterile and culture positive endophthalmitis, corneal decomposition, retinal detachment, and retinal tear), which can cause injury to the eye and other complications. the side effects previously reported for aflibercept include conjunctival hemorrhage, macular degeneration, eye pain, retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous floaters. there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully obtain regulatory approval for aflibercept 8 mg. in addition, commercialization of eylea or our other products and potential future commercialization of aflibercept 8 mg or our other product candidates may be impacted by actions of third parties on which we rely, such as manufacturers of syringes or other devices used in the administration of our products. these and other complications or issues or side effects could harm further development and/or commercialization of eylea as well as further development and potential future commercialization of aflibercept 8 mg.
dupixent and libtayo are being studied in additional indications, as shown in the table under part i, item 1. "business - programs in clinical development." there is no guarantee that regulatory approval of dupixent or libtayo (as applicable) in any of these indications will be successfully obtained. the side effects previously reported for dupixent include hypersensitivity reactions, conjunctivitis and keratitis, injection-site reactions, eye and eyelid inflammation, cold sores, oropharyngeal pain, eosinophilia, insomnia, toothache, gastritis, joint pain (arthralgia), and facial rash or redness; and the side effects previously reported for libtayo include certain immune-mediated adverse reactions, such as pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, and dermatologic reactions, as well as infusion-related reactions, cellulitis, sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, fatigue, rash, and diarrhea. these and other complications or side effects could harm further development and/or commercialization of dupixent and libtayo (as applicable).
there also are risks inherent in subcutaneous injections (which are used for administering most of our antibody-based products and product candidates), such as injection-site reactions (including redness, itching, swelling, pain, and tenderness) and other side effects. these and other complications or side effects could harm further development and/or commercialization of our antibody-based products and product candidates utilizing this method of administration.
in addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidates, the administration of recombinant proteins frequently causes an immune response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein. the antibodies can have no effect or can totally neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect. in some cases, the antibody can cross-react with the patient's own proteins, resulting in an "auto-immune" type disease. whether antibodies will be created can often not be predicted from preclinical or clinical experiments, and their detection or appearance is often delayed, so neutralizing antibodies may be detected at a later date, in some cases even after pivotal clinical trials have been completed.
we may be unable to formulate or manufacture our product candidates in a way that is suitable for clinical or commercial use, which would delay or prevent continued development of such candidates and/or receipt of regulatory approval or commercial sale, which could materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
if we are unable to continue to develop suitable product formulations or manufacturing processes to support large-scale clinical testing of our product candidates, including our antibody-based product candidates, we may be unable to supply necessary materials for our clinical trials, which would delay or prevent the development of our product candidates. similarly, if we are unable, directly or through our collaborators or third parties, to supply sufficient quantities of our products or develop formulations of our product candidates suitable for commercial use, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval for those product candidates.
many of our products are intended to be used and, if approved, our product candidates may be used in combination with drug-delivery devices, which may result in additional regulatory, commercialization, and other risks.
many of our products are used and some of our products and product candidates may be used, if approved, in combination with a drug-delivery device, including a pre-filled syringe, patch pump, auto-injector, or other delivery system. for example, in the united states and the eu, eylea is approved in the 2mg pre-filled syringe. the success of our products and product candidates may depend to a significant extent on the performance of such devices, some of which may be novel or comprised of complex components. given the increased complexity of the review process when approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing application and the additional risks resulting from a product candidate's designation as a combination product discussed below, our product candidates used with such drug-delivery devices may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval or may not be approved at all. the fda review process and criteria for such applications are not well established, which could also lead to delays in the approval process. in addition, some of these drug-delivery devices may be provided by single-source, third-party providers or our collaborators. in any such case, we may be dependent on the sustained cooperation of those third-party providers or collaborators to supply and manufacture the devices; to conduct the studies and prepare related documentation required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies; and to continue to meet the applicable regulatory and other requirements to maintain approval or clearance once it has been received. in addition, other parties may allege that our drug-delivery devices infringe patents or other intellectual property rights. for example, we are currently party to patent infringement and other proceedings relating to the eylea pre-filled syringe, as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. failure to successfully develop or supply the devices, delays in or failure of the studies conducted by us, our collaborators, or third-party providers, or failure of our company, our collaborators, or the third-party providers to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs, delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval, and associated delays in a product or product candidate reaching the market. loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. further, failure to successfully develop or supply and manufacture these devices, or to gain or maintain their approval, could adversely affect sales of the related products.
in the united states, each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the fda for that type of component, whether a drug, biologic, or device. the determination whether a product is a combination product or two separately regulated products is made by the fda on a case-by-case basis. although a single marketing application is generally sufficient for the approval, clearance, or licensure of a combination product, the fda may determine that separate marketing applications are necessary. in addition, submitting separate marketing applications may be necessary to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application. this could significantly increase the resources and time required to bring a particular combination product to market.
risks related to intellectual property and market exclusivity for purposes of this subsection, references to our intellectual property (including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets) include that of our collaborators and licensees, unless otherwise stated or required by the context.
if we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, or our patents or other means of defending our intellectual property are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our business and competitive position will be harmed.
our business requires using sensitive and proprietary technology and other information that we protect as trade secrets. we seek to prevent improper disclosure of these trade secrets through confidentiality agreements and other means. if our trade secrets are improperly disclosed, by our current or former employees, our collaborators, or otherwise, it could help our competitors and adversely affect our business. we will be able to protect our proprietary rights only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and other information are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. the patent position of biotechnology companies, including our company, involves complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. our patents may be challenged, invalidated, held to be unenforceable, or circumvented. for example, certain of our u.s. patents (including those pertaining to our key products, such as eylea) have been and may in the future be challenged by parties who file a request for post-grant review or inter partes review under the america invents act of 2011 or ex parte reexamination, as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. post-grant proceedings are increasingly common in the united states and are costly to defend. in addition, patent applications filed outside the united states may be challenged by other parties, for example, by filing third-party observations that argue against patentability or an opposition. such opposition proceedings are increasingly common in the eu and are costly to defend. for example, our european patent no. 2,264,163 (which concerns genetically engineered mice capable of producing chimeric antibodies that are part human and part mouse) is the subject of opposition proceedings in the european patent office (the "epo") (currently pending before its boards of appeal). in addition, on october 26 and october 27, 2021, anonymous parties initiated opposition proceedings in the epo against our european patent no. 2,944,306 (which concerns pre-filled syringes comprising ophthalmic formulations containing vegf antagonists such as aflibercept for intravitreal administration), as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. we have pending patent applications in the united states patent and trademark office (the "uspto"), the epo, and the patent offices of other foreign jurisdictions, and it is likely that we will need to defend patents from challenges by others from time to time in the future. our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive advantages against competitors. furthermore, even if the outcome is favorable to us, the enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be extremely expensive and time consuming.
changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the united states and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions or our ability to obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights. any such changes could also affect the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patents. for example, the world trade organization ("wto") is currently considering a proposal formulated in connection with the covid-19 pandemic for a waiver of certain intellectual property rights under the wto agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights; the ultimate timing and scope of this waiver is unknown and we cannot be certain that our intellectual property rights related to regen-cov or any other current or future product or product candidate or technology would not be eliminated, narrowed, or weakened by any such waiver.
we also currently hold issued trademark registrations and have trademark applications pending in the united states and other jurisdictions, any of which may be the subject of a governmental or third-party objection, which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark. as our products mature, our reliance on our trademarks to differentiate us from our competitors increases and as a result, if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting, registering, or using trademarks that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights, our business could be adversely affected.
we may be restricted in our development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization activities by patents or other proprietary rights of others, and could be subject to awards of damages if we are found to have infringed such patents or rights.
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of others (including those relating to trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets). other parties may allege that they own blocking patents to our products in clinical development or even to products that have received regulatory approval and are being or have been commercialized, either because they claim to hold proprietary rights to the composition of a product or the way it is manufactured or the way it is used. moreover, other parties may allege that they have blocking patents to antibody-based products made using our velocimmune technology, or any other of our technologies, either because of the way the antibodies are discovered or produced or because of a proprietary composition covering an antibody or the antibody's target.
we have been in the past, are currently, and may in the future be involved in patent litigation and other proceedings involving patents and other intellectual property. for example, we and/or sanofi are currently party to patent infringement proceedings initiated by amgen against us and/or sanofi relating to praluent and other intellectual property proceedings relating to dupixent, as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. in addition, we are currently party to patent infringement and other proceedings relating to eylea and regen-cov, as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
we are aware of patents and pending patent applications owned by others that claim compositions and methods of treatment relating to targets and conditions that we are also pursuing with our products and/or product candidates. although we do not believe that any of our products or our late-stage antibody-based product candidates infringe any valid claim in these patents or patent applications, these other parties could initiate lawsuits for patent infringement and assert that their patents are valid and cover our products or our late-stage antibody-based product candidates, similar to the patent infringement proceedings referred to above. further, we are aware of a number of patent applications of others that, if granted with claims as currently drafted, may cover our current or planned activities. it could be determined that our products and/or actions in manufacturing or selling our products or product candidates infringe such patents.
patent holders could assert claims against us for damages and seek to prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or developing our products or product candidates, and a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of others. in the event that the manufacture, use, or sale of any of our products or product candidates infringes on the patents or violates other proprietary rights of others, we may be prevented from pursuing product development, manufacturing, and commercialization of those drugs and may be required to pay costly damages. in addition, in the event that we assert our patent rights against other parties that we believe are infringing our patent rights, such parties may challenge the validity of our patents and we may become the target of litigation, which may result in an outcome that is unfavorable to us. any of these adverse developments may materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. in any event, legal disputes are likely to be costly and time consuming to defend.
we seek to obtain licenses to patents when, in our judgment, such licenses are needed or advisable. for example, in august 2018, we and sanofi entered into a license agreement with bristol-myers squibb, e. r. squibb & sons, and ono pharmaceutical to obtain a license under certain patents owned and/or exclusively licensed by one or more of these parties that includes the right to develop and sell libtayo. if any licenses are required, we may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. the failure to obtain any such license could prevent us from developing or commercializing any one or more of our products or product candidates, which could severely harm our business.
in addition, other parties may have regulatory exclusivity in the united states or foreign jurisdictions for products relating to targets or conditions we are also pursuing, which could prevent or delay our ability to apply for or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in such jurisdictions. for example, in the eu, a designated orphan drug is provided up to 10 years of market exclusivity in the orphan indication, during which time the ema is generally precluded from accepting a maa for a similar medicinal product unless it can be demonstrated that it is safer, more effective, or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product.
loss or limitation of patent rights, and regulatory pathways for biosimilar competition, could reduce the duration of market exclusivity for our products.
in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the majority of an innovative product's commercial value is usually realized during the period in which it has market exclusivity. in the united states and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there usually are very substantial and rapid declines in the product's sales.
if our late-stage product candidates or other clinical candidates are approved for marketing in the united states or elsewhere, market exclusivity for those products will generally be based upon patent rights and/or certain regulatory forms of exclusivity. as described above under "if we cannot protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, or our patents or other means of defending our intellectual property are insufficient to protect our proprietary rights, our business and competitive position will be harmed," the scope and enforceability of our patent rights may vary from country to country. the failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property rights, or limitations on the use, or the loss, of such rights could materially harm us. absent patent protection or regulatory exclusivity for our products, it is possible, both in the united states and elsewhere, that generic, biosimilar, and/or interchangeable versions of those products may be approved and marketed, which would likely result in substantial and rapid reductions in revenues from sales of those products.
under the ppaca, there is an abbreviated path in the united states for regulatory approval of products that are demonstrated to be "biosimilar" or "interchangeable" with an fda-approved biological product. the ppaca provides a regulatory mechanism that allows for fda approval of biologic drugs that are similar to innovative drugs on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full bla. under this regulation, an application for approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product. however, qualified innovative biological products receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the fda may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the fda. however, the term of regulatory exclusivity may not remain at 12 years in the united states and could be shortened if, for example, the ppaca is amended.
a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states have also established abbreviated pathways for regulatory approval of biological products that are biosimilar to earlier versions of biological products. for example, the eu has had an established regulatory pathway for biosimilars since 2005.
the increased likelihood of biosimilar competition has increased the risk of loss of innovators' market exclusivity. it is also not possible to predict changes in united states regulatory law that might reduce biological product regulatory exclusivity. due to this risk, and uncertainties regarding patent protection, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for any particular product we currently or may in the future commercialize with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory exclusivity. we are aware of several companies developing biosimilar versions of eylea, as discussed further under "risks related to commercialization of our marketed products, product candidates, and new indications for our marketed products - the commercial success of our products and product candidates is subject to significant competition - marketed products" above. in the united states, the regulatory exclusivity period for eylea (i.e., the period during which no biosimilar product can be approved by the fda) expires on november 18, 2023, with the possibility of an additional six months of regulatory exclusivity (i.e., until may 18, 2024) if the fda grants pediatric exclusivity based on our completion of certain studies evaluating eylea in pediatric patients with rop and submission of the data from these studies to the fda no later than 15 months before the date on which regulatory exclusivity would otherwise expire. the loss of market exclusivity for a product (such as eylea) would likely materially and negatively affect revenues from product sales of that product and thus our financial results and condition.
risks related to manufacturing and supply we rely on limited internal and contracted manufacturing and supply chain capacity, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our marketed products and, if approved, our product candidates and to advance our clinical pipeline.
we have large-scale manufacturing operations in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland. manufacturing facilities operated by us and by third-party contract manufacturers engaged by us would be inadequate to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredients of our current marketed products and our product candidates in sufficient clinical quantities if our clinical pipeline advances as planned. for example, our internal and contracted manufacturing capacity may not be sufficient to cover the demand for regen-cov and our other covid-19 monoclonal antibodies (if successfully developed and authorized for use). in addition to expanding our internal capacity, we intend to continue to rely on our collaborators, and may also rely on contract manufacturers, to produce commercial quantities of drug material needed for commercialization of our products. for example, as described in part i, item 1. "business," in august 2020, we announced a collaboration agreement with roche to develop, manufacture, and distribute regen-cov (known as ronapreve in other countries outside the united states). we cannot be certain that our current manufacturing and distribution capacity for regen-cov or the increased manufacturing and distribution capacity through our collaboration with roche will be sufficient if there is significant future demand for regen-cov. as we increase our production in anticipation of potential regulatory approval for our product candidates, our current manufacturing capacity will likely not be sufficient, and our dependence on our collaborators and/or contract manufacturers may increase, to produce adequate quantities of drug material for both commercial and clinical purposes. we also rely entirely on other parties and our collaborators for filling and finishing services. generally, in order for other parties to perform any step in the manufacturing and supply chain, we must transfer technology to the other party, which can be time consuming and may not be successfully accomplished without considerable cost and expense, or at all. we will have to depend on these other parties to perform effectively on a timely basis and to comply with regulatory requirements. if for any reason they are unable to do so, and as a result we are unable to directly or through other parties manufacture and supply sufficient commercial and clinical quantities of our products on acceptable terms, or if we should encounter delays or other difficulties with our collaborators, contract manufacturers, warehouses, shipping, testing laboratories, or other parties involved in our supply chain which adversely affect the timely manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be materially harmed.
expanding our manufacturing capacity and establishing fill/finish capabilities will be costly and we may be unsuccessful in doing so in a timely manner, which could delay or prevent the launch and successful commercialization of our marketed products and product candidates or other indications for our marketed products if they are approved for marketing and could jeopardize our current and future clinical development programs.
in addition to our existing manufacturing facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, we may lease, operate, purchase, or construct additional facilities to conduct expanded manufacturing or other related activities in the future. expanding our manufacturing capacity to supply commercial quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for our marketed products and our product candidates if they are approved for marketing, and to supply clinical drug material to support the continued growth of our clinical programs, will require substantial additional expenditures, time, and various regulatory approvals and permits. this also holds true for establishing fill/finish capabilities in the future, for which we are in the process of constructing fill/finish facilities (refer to part ii, item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources" for information about expected capital expenditures relating to this and other projects). further, we will need to hire and train significant numbers of employees and managerial personnel to staff our expanding manufacturing and supply chain operations, as well as any future fill/finish activities. start-up costs can be large, and scale-up entails significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields. in addition, we may face difficulties or delays in developing or acquiring the necessary production equipment and technology to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates at reasonable costs and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. the fda and analogous foreign regulatory authorities must determine that our existing and any expanded manufacturing facilities and any future fill/finish activities comply, or continue to comply, with cgmp requirements for both clinical and commercial production and license them, or continue to license them, accordingly, and such facilities must also comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other governmental permitting requirements. we may not successfully expand or establish sufficient manufacturing or any future fill/finish capabilities or manufacture our products economically or in compliance with cgmps and other regulatory requirements, and we and our collaborators may not be able to build or procure additional capacity in the required timeframe to meet commercial demand for our product candidates if they receive regulatory approval, and to continue to meet the requirements of our clinical programs. this would interfere with our efforts to successfully commercialize our marketed products, and could also delay or require us to discontinue one or more of our clinical development programs. as a result, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed.
our ability to manufacture products may be impaired if any of our or our collaborators' manufacturing activities, or the activities of other third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain, are found to infringe patents of others.
our ability to continue to manufacture products in our rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland facilities and at additional facilities (if any) in the future (including our ability to conduct any fill/finish activities in the future), the ability of our collaborators to manufacture products at their facilities, and our ability to utilize other third parties to produce our products, to supply raw materials or other products, or to perform fill/finish services or other steps in our manufacture and supply chain, depends on our and their ability to operate without infringing the patents or other intellectual property rights of others. other parties may allege that our or our collaborators' manufacturing activities, or the activities of other third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain (which may be located in jurisdictions outside the united states), infringe patents or other intellectual property rights. for example, we are currently party to patent infringement and other proceedings relating to the eylea pre-filled syringe, as described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. a judicial or regulatory decision in favor of one or more parties making such allegations could directly or indirectly preclude the manufacture of our products to which those intellectual property rights apply on a temporary or permanent basis, which could materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
if sales of our marketed products do not meet the levels currently expected, or if the launch of any of our product candidates is delayed or unsuccessful, we may face costs related to excess inventory or unused capacity at our manufacturing facilities and at the facilities of third parties or our collaborators.
we use our manufacturing facilities primarily to produce bulk product for commercial supply of our marketed products and clinical and preclinical candidates for ourselves and our collaborations. we also plan to use such facilities to produce bulk product for commercial supply of new indications of our marketed products and new product candidates if they are approved for marketing or otherwise authorized for use. if our clinical candidates are discontinued or their clinical development is delayed, if the launch of new indications for our marketed products or new product candidates is delayed or does not occur, or if such products are launched and the launch is unsuccessful or the product is subsequently recalled or marketing approval is rescinded, we may have to absorb one hundred percent of related overhead costs and inefficiencies, as well as similar costs of third-party contract manufacturers performing services for us. in addition, if we or our collaborators experience excess inventory, it may be necessary to write down or write off such excess inventory or incur an impairment charge with respect to the facility where such product is manufactured, which could adversely affect our operating results. for example, during the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a charge of $231.7 million to write down regen-cov inventory, as described in part ii, item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations."
third-party service or supply failures, or other failures, business interruptions, or other disasters affecting our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, the manufacturing facilities of our collaborators, or the facilities of any other party participating in the supply chain, would adversely affect our ability to supply our products.
bulk drug materials are currently manufactured at our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, as well as at our collaborators' facilities. we and our collaborators would be unable to manufacture these materials if the relevant facility were to cease production due to regulatory requirements or actions, business interruptions, labor shortages or disputes, contaminations, fire, climate change, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, or other problems.
many of our products and product candidates are very difficult to manufacture. as our products and most of our product candidates are biologics, they require processing steps that are more difficult than those required for many other chemical pharmaceuticals. accordingly, multiple steps are needed to control the manufacturing processes. problems with these manufacturing processes, even minor deviations from the normal process or from the materials used in the manufacturing process (which may not be detectable by us or our collaborators in a timely manner), could lead to product defects or manufacturing failures, resulting in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims, and insufficient inventory. also, the complexity of our manufacturing process may make it difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to transfer our technology to our collaborators or contract manufacturers.
also, certain raw materials or other products necessary for the manufacture and formulation of our marketed products and product candidates, some of which are difficult to source, are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. in addition, we rely on certain third parties or our collaborators to perform filling, finishing, distribution, laboratory testing, and other services related to the manufacture of our marketed products and product candidates, and to supply various raw materials and other products. we would be unable to obtain these raw materials, other products, or services for an indeterminate period of time if any of these third parties were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials, products, or services to us for any reason, including due to regulatory requirements or actions (including recalls), adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier, failure by the supplier to comply with cgmps, contaminations, business interruptions, or labor shortages or disputes (in each case, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated many of these issues). in any such circumstances, we may not be able to engage a backup or alternative supplier or service provider in a timely manner or at all. this, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our or our collaborators' ability to manufacture or supply marketed products and product candidates, which could materially and adversely affect our business and future prospects.
certain of the raw materials required in the manufacture and testing of our products and product candidates may be derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum, and human serum albumin. there are certain regulatory restrictions on using these biological source materials. if we or our collaborators are required to substitute for these sources to comply with such regulatory requirements, our clinical development or commercial activities may be delayed or interrupted.
we and our collaborators and other third-party providers are required to maintain compliance with cgmps, and are subject to inspections by the fda or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing may require amending our application(s) to the fda or such comparable foreign agencies and acceptance of the change by the fda or such comparable foreign agencies prior to release of product(s). because we produce multiple products and product candidates at our facilities in rensselaer, new york and limerick, ireland, there are increased risks associated with cgmp compliance. our inability, or the inability of our collaborators and third-party fill/finish or other service providers, to demonstrate ongoing cgmp compliance could require us to engage in lengthy and expensive remediation efforts, withdraw or recall product, halt or interrupt clinical trials, and/or interrupt commercial supply of any marketed products, and could also delay or prevent our obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products. any delay, interruption, or other issue that arises in the manufacture, fill/finish, packaging, or storage of any drug product or product candidate as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of our collaborators or other third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection or maintain cgmp compliance could significantly impair our ability to develop, obtain approval for, and successfully commercialize our products, which would substantially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. any finding of non-compliance could also increase our costs, cause us to delay the development of our product candidates, result in delay in our obtaining, or our not obtaining, regulatory approval of product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, and cause us to lose revenue from any marketed products, which could be seriously detrimental to our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions and damage our reputation.
other regulatory and litigation risks if the testing or use of our products harms people, or is perceived to harm them even when such harm is unrelated to our products, we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.
the testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of drugs for use in people expose us to product liability risk. any informed consent or waivers obtained from people who enroll in our clinical trials may not protect us from liability or the cost of litigation. we may also be subject to claims by patients who use our approved products, or our product candidates if those product candidates receive regulatory approval and become commercially available, that they have been injured by a side effect associated with the drug. even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our products or product candidates, the related investigation may be time consuming or inconclusive and may have a negative impact on our reputation or business. we may face product liability claims and be found responsible even if injury arises from the acts or omissions of third parties who provide fill/finish or other services. to the extent we maintain product liability insurance in relevant periods, such insurance may not cover all potential liabilities or may not completely cover any liability arising from any such litigation. moreover, in the future we may not have access to liability insurance or be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms.
our business activities have been, and may in the future be, challenged under federal or state healthcare laws, which may subject us to civil or criminal proceedings, investigations, or penalties.
the fda regulates the marketing and promotion of our products, which must comply with the food, drug, and cosmetic act and applicable fda implementing standards. the fda's review of promotional activities includes healthcare provider-directed and direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and sales representatives' communications. failure to comply with applicable fda requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the fda, the department of justice, or the office of the inspector general of the hhs, as well as state authorities. this could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes a drug. the fda may take enforcement action for promoting unapproved uses of a product or other violations of its advertising laws and regulations. the applicable regulations in countries outside the u.s. grant similar powers to the competent authorities and impose similar obligations on companies.
in addition to fda and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care "fraud and abuse" laws, such as the federal civil false claims act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal social security act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. the u.s. federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute (the "aks") prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving payments or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward someone to purchase, prescribe, endorse, arrange for, or recommend a product or service that is reimbursed under federal healthcare programs such as medicare or medicaid. if we provide payments or other remuneration to a healthcare professional to induce the prescribing of our products, we could face liability under state and federal anti-kickback laws. recently, the bipartisan budget act of 2018 increased the criminal and civil penalties that can be imposed for violating certain federal health care laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute.
the federal civil false claims act prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. the false claims act also permits a private individual acting as a "whistleblower" to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. pharmaceutical companies have been investigated and/or prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the fda has not approved, known as off-label uses, that caused claims to be submitted to medicaid for non-covered off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the medicaid rebate program. pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment for individuals and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. even if it is determined that we have not violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which would harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be challenged under one or more of such laws. as described further in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, we are party to a civil complaint filed in june 2020 by the u.s. attorney's office for the district of massachusetts concerning our support of a 501(c)(3) organization that provides financial assistance to patients; and we are cooperating with pending government investigations concerning certain other business activities. any adverse decision, finding, allegation, or exercise of enforcement or regulatory discretion in any such proceedings or investigations could harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
as part of the ppaca, the federal government requires that pharmaceutical manufacturers record any "transfers of value" made to u.s. licensed physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. information provided by companies is aggregated and posted annually on an "open payments" website, which is managed by cms, the agency responsible for implementing these disclosure requirements. beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information (starting with information collected during 2021) regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives.
we continue to dedicate significant resources to comply with these requirements and need to be prepared to comply with additional reporting obligations outside the united states that may apply in the future. in addition, several states have legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities; restrict when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals or gifts to prescribers or engage in other marketing-related activities; require identification or licensing of sales representatives; and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. many of these requirements and standards are new or uncertain, and the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements may be unclear. if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, and could receive adverse publicity, which would harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. additionally, access to such data by fraud-and-abuse investigators and industry critics may draw scrutiny to our collaborations with reported entities.
if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.
we participate in the medicaid drug rebate program, the public health service's 340b drug pricing program (the "340b program"), the u.s. department of veterans affairs ("va") federal supply schedule ("fss") pricing program, and the tricare retail pharmacy program. see part i, item 1, "business - government regulation - pricing and reimbursement" for a description of these programs.
pricing and rebate calculations vary across products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. such interpretation can change and evolve over time. in the case of our medicaid pricing data, if we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the medicaid drug rebate program and could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters. price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products under the 340b program.
civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price or product information to the government, if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, if we fail to submit the required price data on a timely basis, or if we are found to have charged 340b covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. cms could also decide to terminate our medicaid drug rebate agreement, or hrsa could decide to terminate our 340b program participation agreement, in which case federal payments may not be available under medicaid or medicare part b for our covered outpatient drugs.
our failure to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program and other governmental programs could negatively impact our financial results. cms issued a final regulation, which became effective on april 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the medicaid drug rebate program under the ppaca. the final regulation has increased and will continue to increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, has been and will continue to be time-consuming to implement, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly if cms challenges the approach we have taken in our implementation of the final regulation. other regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the medicaid drug rebate program may have a similar impact.
hrsa issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340b ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on january 1, 2019. implementation of this regulation has affected our obligations and potential liability under the 340b program. we are also required to report the 340b ceiling prices for our covered outpatient drugs to hrsa, which then publishes them to 340b covered entities. any charge by hrsa that we have violated the requirements of the program or the regulation could negatively impact our financial results. moreover, under a final regulation effective january 13, 2021, hrsa newly established an adr process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. such claims are to be resolved through an adr panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. an adr proceeding could subject us to onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability. further, any additional future changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the medicaid rebate amount under the ppaca or otherwise could affect our 340b ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.
starting in 2023, manufacturers must pay refunds to medicare for single-source drugs or biological products, or biosimilar biological products, reimbursed under medicare part b and packaged in single-dose containers or single-use packages for units of discarded drug reimbursed by medicare part b in excess of 10 percent of total allowed charges under medicare part b for that drug. manufacturers that fail to pay refunds could be subject to civil monetary penalties of 125 percent of the refund amount.
pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with price reporting or contract‐based requirements under the va/fss and/or tricare programs can subject a manufacturer to civil monetary penalties. these program and contract-based obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements. if we overcharge the government in connection with our arrangements with fss or tricare, we are required to refund the difference to the government. failure to make necessary disclosures or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the false claims act and other laws and regulations. unexpected refunds to the government, and/or response to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.
risks from the improper conduct of employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators could adversely affect our reputation and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
we cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies, and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including, without limitation, healthcare, employment, foreign corrupt practices, trade restrictions and sanctions, environmental, competition, and privacy laws and regulations. such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, and monetary and injunctive penalties, and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, operating results, and reputation.
in particular, our business activities outside the united states are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the u.k. bribery act. the fcpa generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-u.s. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. the fcpa also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-u.s. governments. additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the fcpa. recently the sec and department of justice have increased their fcpa enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. there is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our ability to expand internationally, our ability to attract and retain employees, and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials. compliance with these laws and regulations is costly, and we may incur substantial liability arising from our activities involving the use of hazardous materials.
as a fully integrated biotechnology company with significant research and development and manufacturing operations, we are subject to extensive environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials. our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals, infectious agents (such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi), radioactive compounds, and other hazardous materials. the cost of compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations is substantial. if an accident involving these materials or an environmental discharge were to occur, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, or face regulatory actions, which could exceed our resources or insurance coverage.
our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure, and accounting requirements and regulations that could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
we are subject to changing rules and regulations of various federal and state governmental authorities as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. these entities, including the sec and the nasdaq stock market llc, have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional requirements and regulations. for example, there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the dodd-frank wall street reform and protection act that expressly authorized or required the sec to adopt additional rules in these areas, a number of which have yet to be fully implemented. our efforts to comply with these requirements and regulations (as well as corporate governance and disclosure expectations of investors and other stakeholders) have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management's time from other business activities.
•new laws, regulations, or judicial decisions related to healthcare availability or the payment for healthcare products and services, including prescription drugs, that would make it more difficult for us to market and sell products once they are approved by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies;
•changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring prior to or after the introduction of new products to market, which could materially increase our costs of doing business; and
•changes in fda and foreign cgmp requirements that may make it more difficult and costly for us to maintain regulatory compliance and/or manufacture our marketed product and product candidates in accordance with cgmps.
the u.s. government could carry out other significant changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy, including with respect to government reimbursement changes and drug price control measures (such as those discussed above under "risks related to commercialization of our marketed products, product candidates, and new indications for our marketed products - sales of our marketed products are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition"). while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes in the laws, regulations, and policies governing the development and approval of our product candidates and the commercialization, importation, and reimbursement of our products could adversely affect our business. in addition, our development and commercialization activities could be harmed or delayed by a shutdown of the u.s. government, including the fda. for example, a prolonged shutdown may significantly delay the fda's ability to timely review and process any submissions we have filed or may file or cause other regulatory delays, which could materially and adversely affect our business.
risks associated with our operations outside the united states could adversely affect our business.
we have operations and conduct business outside the united states and we plan to expand these activities. for example, we recently commenced co-commercialization activities under the antibody collaboration related to dupixent in certain jurisdictions outside the united states. consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries, which include:
•unfamiliar foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements, including those with which we and/or our collaborators must comply in order to maintain our marketing authorizations outside the united states;
•other laws and regulatory requirements to which our business activities abroad are subject, such as the fcpa and the u.k. bribery act (discussed in greater detail above under "risks from the improper conduct of employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators could adversely affect our reputation and our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition");
•changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region;
for example, effective january 31, 2020, the united kingdom commenced an exit from the eu, commonly referred to as "brexit." the transition period for brexit expired on december 31, 2020 following the entry into a trade agreement that now governs the united kingdom's relationship with the eu. we do not know to what extent brexit will ultimately impact the business and regulatory environment in the united kingdom, the rest of the eu, or other countries. for example, the impact of brexit on the ongoing validity in the united kingdom of current eu authorizations for medicinal products and on the future process for obtaining and maintaining marketing authorization for pharmaceutical products manufactured or sold in the united kingdom remains uncertain. we have large-scale manufacturing operations in limerick, ireland and have also established an office in the vicinity of london. changes impacting our ability to conduct business in the united kingdom or other eu countries, or changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in those countries (such as with respect to the approval of our product candidates), may materially and adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
we may incur additional tax liabilities related to our operations.
we are subject to income tax in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities, and our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of the applicable statutory rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. we record liabilities for uncertain tax positions that involve significant management judgment as to the application of law. the internal revenue service or other domestic or foreign taxing authorities have previously disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our interpretation of tax law as applied to the operations of regeneron and its subsidiaries or with the positions we may take with respect to particular tax issues on our tax returns (see also note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report). consequently, our reported effective tax rate and our after-tax cash flows may be materially and adversely affected by tax assessments or judgments in excess of accrued amounts we have estimated in preparing our financial statements. further, our effective tax rate may also be adversely affected by numerous other factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in tax laws and regulations, and tax effects of the accounting for stock-based compensation (which depend in part on the price of our stock and, therefore, are beyond our control). changes to u.s. tax laws and/or recommendations from the organization for economic co-operation and development (the "oecd") regarding a global minimum tax and other changes being considered and/or implemented in countries where we operate could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability, and effective tax rate. in addition, recommendations by the oecd and the eu could require companies to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny. even though we regularly assess the information provided to tax authorities in determining the appropriateness of our tax reserves, such tax authorities could take a position that is contrary to our expectations, and the result could adversely affect our provision for income tax and our current rate.
our ability to conduct our business is significantly dependent on the data that we collect, process, and share in discovering and developing drug products. these data are often considered personal data and are therefore regulated by data privacy laws in applicable jurisdictions.
our clinical trial programs and research collaborations outside the u.s. (such as our consortium with a group of companies to fund the generation of genetic exome sequence data from the uk biobank health resource) implicate non-u.s. data protection laws, including the gdpr. the gdpr has a range of compliance obligations, including increased transparency requirements and data subject rights. violations of the gdpr carry significant financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher)). in addition to the gdpr, certain eu member states have issued or will be issuing their own implementation legislation. in june 2021, the european commission introduced new standard contractual clauses required to be incorporated into new and existing agreements within prescribed timeframes in order to continue to lawfully transfer personal data outside the eu. compliance with these requirements has been and is expected to continue to be costly and time consuming.
we conduct clinical trials in many countries around the world, which have new or evolving data privacy laws that have resulted in increased liability in the management of clinical trial data, and additional contractual and due-diligence obligations that could lead to a delay in clinical trial site start-up. while we continue to monitor these developments, there remains some uncertainty surrounding the legal and regulatory environment for these evolving privacy and data protection laws. complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance, including the risk of substantial financial penalties for insufficient notice and consent, failure to respond to data subject rights requests, lack of a legal basis for the transfer of personal information out of the eu, or improper processing of personal data under the gdpr. failure by our collaborators to comply with the strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside the eu into the u.s. may result in the imposition of criminal and administrative sanctions on such collaborators or impact the flow of personal data outside the eu, which could adversely affect our business and could create liability for us.
most u.s. health care providers, including research institutions from which we or our collaborators obtain clinical trial data, are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under hipaa. for example, as part of our human genetics initiative, our wholly-owned subsidiary, regeneron genetics center llc, has entered into collaborations with research institutions, including the geisinger health system, which are subject to hipaa. regeneron is not a covered entity or business associate under hipaa and thus is not subject to its requirements. however, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly receive, use, or disclose phi in a manner that is not permitted under hipaa. consequently, depending on the facts and circumstances, we could face substantial criminal penalties if we knowingly receive phi from a health care provider or research institution that has not satisfied hipaa's requirements for its disclosure. there are instances where we collect and maintain personal data, which may include health information that is outside the scope of hipaa but within the scope of state health privacy laws or similar state level privacy legislation. this information may be received throughout the clinical trial process, in the course of our research collaborations, directly from individuals who enroll in our patient assistance programs, and from our own employees in a pandemic response process (such as in connection with the covid-19 pandemic).
consumer protection laws impact the manner in which we develop and maintain processes to support our patient assistance programs, product marketing activities, and the sharing of employee and clinical data for internal and third-party commercial activities. several u.s. states have proposed and passed consumer privacy laws, which were modeled after the comprehensive consumer privacy law in california, the ccpa. the ccpa, which became effective on january 1, 2020, is a consumer protection law that establishes requirements for data use and sharing transparency and provides california residents with personal data privacy rights regarding the use, disclosure, and retention of their personal data. amendments to the ccpa have, among other things, imposed new obligations to provide notice where personal data will be de-identified. these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may impose limitations on our business activities. several other u.s. states have introduced similar consumer protection laws that may go into effect in the near future. at the federal level, section 5 of the federal trade commission act is a consumer protection law that bars unfair and deceptive acts and practices and requires, among other things, companies to notify individuals that they will safeguard their personal data and that they will fulfil the commitments made in their privacy notices. the federal trade commission has brought legal actions against organizations that have violated consumers' privacy rights or have misled them by failing to maintain appropriate security.
furthermore, health privacy laws, data breach notification laws, consumer protection laws, data localization laws, and genetic privacy laws may apply directly to our operations and/or those of our collaborators and may impose restrictions on our collection, use, and dissemination of individuals' health and other personal data. new state level genetic privacy and consumer protection laws in the united states may require additional transparency and permissions in our informed consent forms. moreover, individuals about whom we or our collaborators obtain health or other personal data, as well as the providers and third parties who share this information with us, may have statutory or contractual limits that impact our ability to use and disclose the information. we are likely to be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws both inside and outside the united states. many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and have different effects. many of the state laws enable a state attorney general to bring actions and provide private rights of action to consumers as enforcement mechanisms. compliance with these laws requires a flexible privacy framework as they are constantly evolving. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity. federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs' attorneys have been active in this space. claims that we have violated individuals' privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.
if we or any collaborators fail to comply with applicable federal, state, local, or foreign regulatory requirements, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions that could affect our or any collaborators' ability to commercialize our products and could harm, prevent, or substantially increase the cost of marketing and sales of any affected products that we are able to commercialize. any threatened or actual government enforcement action could also generate adverse publicity and require that we devote substantial resources that could otherwise be used in other aspects of our business.
increasing use of social media could give rise to liability, breaches of data security, or reputational damage.
we and our employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools as a means of communication both internally and externally. despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules, there is a risk that the use of social media by us or our employees to communicate about our products or business may cause us to be found in violation of applicable requirements. in addition, our employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that may not comply with our social media policy or other legal or contractual requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or result in public exposure of personal data of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or our products in social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image, and goodwill. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
risks related to our reliance on third parties if our antibody collaboration or our io collaboration with sanofi is terminated, or sanofi materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain of our products and product candidates in the time expected, or at all, would be materially harmed.
we rely on funding and support from sanofi to develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain of our products and product candidates. with respect to the products that we are co-developing with sanofi under our antibody collaboration (currently consisting of dupixent, kevzara, and itepekimab), sanofi funds a significant portion of development expenses incurred in connection with the development of these products. in addition, we rely on sanofi to lead much of the clinical development efforts, assist with or lead efforts to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals, and lead the commercialization efforts for these products and product candidates.
under our io collaboration, sanofi also funds half of the development expenses incurred in connection with the clinical development of libtayo, subject to an agreed-upon development budget. we also rely on sanofi to lead commercialization efforts outside the united states for libtayo and to assist us to comply with the necessary requirements related to libtayo's regulatory approvals in the eu.
if sanofi terminates the antibody collaboration or the io collaboration or fails to comply with its payment obligations under any of our collaborations, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition would be materially harmed. we would be required to either expend substantially more resources than we have anticipated to support our research and development efforts, which could require us to seek additional funding that might not be available on favorable terms or at all, or materially cut back on such activities. if sanofi does not perform its obligations with respect to the product candidates it is co-developing with us, our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize these product candidates will be significantly adversely affected. we have limited commercial capabilities outside the united states and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities for products commercialized under our antibody collaboration or our io collaboration (see also "risks related to commercialization of our marketed products, product candidates, and new indications for our marketed products - if we are unable to establish commercial capabilities outside the united states for products we intend to commercialize or co-commercialize outside the united states, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected" above). termination of the antibody collaboration or the io collaboration would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful development and commercialization of the products subject to such collaborations, particularly outside the united states.
if our collaboration with bayer for eylea is terminated, or bayer materially breaches its obligations thereunder, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and our ability to continue to commercialize eylea outside the united states would be materially harmed.
we rely heavily on bayer with respect to the commercialization of eylea outside the united states. bayer is responsible for obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval outside the united states, as well as providing all sales, marketing, and commercial support for the product outside the united states. in particular, bayer has responsibility for selling eylea outside the united states using its sales force and, in japan, in cooperation with santen pursuant to a co-promotion and distribution agreement, as in effect from time to time, with bayer's japanese affiliate. if bayer and, in japan, santen do not perform their obligations in a timely manner, or at all, our ability to commercialize eylea outside the united states will be significantly adversely affected. bayer has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us at any time upon six or twelve months' advance notice, depending on the circumstances giving rise to termination. if bayer were to terminate its collaboration agreement with us, we may not have the resources or skills to replace those of our collaborator, which could require us to seek another collaboration that might not be available on favorable terms or at all, and could cause significant issues for the commercialization of eylea outside the united states and result in substantial additional costs and/or lower revenues to us. we have limited commercial capabilities outside the united states and would have to develop or outsource these capabilities (see also "risks related to commercialization of our marketed products, product candidates, and new indications for our marketed products - if we are unable to establish commercial capabilities outside the united states for products we intend to commercialize or co-commercialize outside the united states, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected" above). termination of the bayer collaboration agreement would create substantial new and additional risks to the successful commercialization of eylea outside the united states.
we depend upon third-party collaborators, including sanofi and bayer, and service providers such as cros, outside testing laboratories, clinical investigator sites, third-party manufacturers, fill/finish providers, and product packagers and labelers, to assist us in the manufacture and preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. we also depend, or will depend, on some of these third parties in connection with the commercialization of our marketed products and our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products if they are approved for marketing. if any of our existing collaborators or service providers breaches or terminates its agreement with us or does not perform its development or manufacturing services under an agreement in a timely manner (including as a result of its inability to perform due to financial or other relevant constraints) or in compliance with applicable gmps, glps, or gcp standards, we could experience additional costs, delays, and difficulties in the manufacture or development of, or in obtaining approval by regulatory authorities for, or successfully commercializing our product candidates.
we and our collaborators rely on third-party service providers to support the distribution of our marketed products and for many other related activities in connection with the commercialization of these marketed products. despite our or our collaborators' arrangements with them, these third parties may not perform adequately. if these service providers do not perform their services adequately, sales of our marketed products will suffer.
risks related to employees we are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research, development, manufacturing, and commercial organizations, our business will be harmed.
we are highly dependent on certain of our executive officers, other key members of our senior management team, and the chair of our board of directors. if we are not able to retain (or for any other reason lose the services of) any of these persons, our business may suffer. in particular, we depend on the services of p. roy vagelos, m.d., the chair of our board of directors; leonard s. schleifer, m.d., ph.d., our president and chief executive officer; and george d. yancopoulos, m.d., ph.d., our president and chief scientific officer. we are also highly dependent on the expertise and services of other senior management members leading our research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts. there is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the research, development, manufacture, and commercialization of drugs. we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary to continue to advance our business and achieve our strategic objectives.
information technology risks significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business.
our business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex, and interdependent information technology systems, including internet-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. these systems are also critical to enable remote working arrangements, which have been growing in importance due in part to the covid-19 pandemic and related developments. the size and complexity of our computer systems make us potentially vulnerable to it system breakdowns, internal and external malicious intrusion, and computer viruses and ransomware, which may impact product production and key business processes. we also have outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and operations to third parties, which may allow them to access our confidential information and may also make our systems vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by such third parties or others.
in addition, our systems are potentially vulnerable to data security breaches - whether by employees or others - which may expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons. data security breaches could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, result in demands for ransom or other forms of blackmail, or lead to the public exposure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including industrial espionage or extortion) and expertise, including by organized criminal groups, "hacktivists," nation states, and others. as a company with an increasingly global presence, our systems are subject to frequent attacks. due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is a risk that an attack may remain undetected for a period of time. while we continue to make investments to improve the protection of data and information technology, and to oversee and monitor the security measures of our suppliers and/or service providers, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. in addition, we depend in part on third-party security measures over which we do not have full control to protect against data security breaches.
if we or our suppliers and/or service providers fail to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data security effectively, or fail to anticipate, plan for, or manage significant disruptions to these systems, we or our suppliers and/or service providers could have difficulty preventing, detecting, or controlling such disruptions or security breaches, which could result in legal proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disruptions to our operations, government investigations, breach of contract claims, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
risks related to our financial results, liquidity, and need for additional financing we may need additional funding in the future, which may not be available to us, and which may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.
we expend substantial resources for research and development, including costs associated with clinical testing of our product candidates and new indications of our marketed products, the commercialization of products, and capital expenditures. we believe our existing capital resources and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, together with funds generated by our current and anticipated eylea net product sales and funding we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements and other similar agreements (including our share of profits in connection with commercialization of eylea and dupixent under our collaboration agreements with bayer and sanofi, respectively), will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs for the foreseeable future. however, one or more of our collaboration agreements may terminate, our revenues may fall short of our projections or be delayed, or our expenses may increase, any of which could result in our capital being consumed significantly faster than anticipated. our expenses may increase for many reasons, including expenses in connection with the commercialization of our marketed products and the potential commercial launches of our product candidates and new indications for our marketed products, manufacturing scale-up, expenses related to clinical trials testing of antibody-based product candidates we are developing on our own (without a collaborator), and expenses for which we are responsible in accordance with the terms of our collaboration agreements.
we cannot be certain that our existing capital resources and our current and anticipated revenues will be sufficient to meet our operating needs. we may require additional financing in the future and we may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms or at all. for example, there is no guarantee that we will have the ability to pay the principal amount due on our senior unsecured notes at maturity or redeem, repurchase, or refinance the notes prior to maturity on acceptable terms or at all. in addition, in march 2017, we completed a $720.0 million lease financing for our existing corporate headquarters and other rentable area consisting of approximately 150 acres of predominately office buildings and laboratory space located in tarrytown, new york. in september 2021, we delivered a request to the lease financing participants to potentially exercise the option for a five-year extension of the term of the lease and the maturity date under the related participation agreement; and in november 2021, the lease financing participants consented to such extension, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions prior to the expiration of the existing term in march 2022. there can be no assurance that such extension will become effective on favorable terms or at all. if such extension does not become effective, we would be obligated to purchase the facility by the end of the existing term in march 2022 by paying a purchase price of $720.0 million, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and yield and all other outstanding amounts under the relevant documents. refer to part ii, item 7. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - tarrytown, new york leases" for further details. our ability to refinance or to obtain additional financing could be adversely affected if there is a significant decline in the demand for our products or other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions. volatility in the financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to raise capital. if additional financing is necessary and we obtain it through the sale of equity securities, such sales will likely be dilutive to our shareholders. debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that would restrict our business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may be at interest rates and contain other terms that are not favorable to our shareholders. should we require and be unable to raise sufficient funds (i) to complete the development of our product candidates, (ii) to successfully commercialize our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products if they obtain regulatory approval, and (iii) to continue our manufacturing and marketing of our marketed products, we may face delay, reduction, or elimination of our research and development or preclinical or clinical programs and our commercialization activities, which would significantly limit our potential to generate revenue.
we have certain indebtedness and contingent liabilities, including milestone and royalty payment obligations. as of december 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $2.700 billion of outstanding indebtedness under our senior unsecured notes and the lease financing facility. we may also incur additional debt in the future. any such indebtedness could:
•limit our ability to access capital markets and incur additional debt in the future;
•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts, research and development, and mergers and acquisitions; and
•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt.
our revenue from outside the united states will increase as our products, whether marketed or otherwise commercialized by us or our collaborators, gain marketing approval in such jurisdictions. our primary foreign currency exposure relates to movements in the japanese yen, euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, and australian dollar. if the u.s. dollar weakens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will increase, having a positive impact on net income, but our overall expenses will increase, having a negative impact. conversely, if the u.s. dollar strengthens against a specific foreign currency, our revenues will decrease, having a negative impact on net income, but our overall expenses will decrease, having a positive impact. therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our operating results and the financial condition of our company.
our investments are subject to risks and other external factors that may result in losses or affect the liquidity of these investments.
as of december 31, 2021, we had $2.886 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $9.647 billion in marketable securities (including $1.250 billion in equity securities). our investments consist primarily of debt securities, including investment-grade corporate bonds. these fixed-income investments are subject to external factors that may adversely affect their market value or liquidity, such as interest rate, liquidity, market, and issuer credit risks, including actual or anticipated changes in credit ratings. the equity securities we hold may experience significant volatility and may decline in value or become worthless if the issuer experiences an adverse development. furthermore, our equity investments could be subject to dilution (and decline in value) as a result of the issuance of additional equity interests by the applicable issuer. if any of our investments suffer market price declines, such declines may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
changes in the method of determining libor, or the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
we are subject to risks related to uncertainty regarding the london interbank offered rate ("libor"), which is in the process of being phased out. the u.k. financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, has announced that it intends to phase out libor. the publication of u.s. dollar libor for certain tenors and all non-u.s. dollar libor tenors ceased after december 31, 2021 (other than certain sterling and japanese yen settings being published on a synthetic temporary basis). banks reporting information used to set u.s. dollar libor for all other tenors are currently expected to stop doing so after june 30, 2023, although the libor administrator may discontinue or modify libor prior to that date. in 2021, the u.s. federal reserve board and certain other regulatory bodies issued guidance encouraging banks and other financial market participants to cease entering into new contracts that use u.s. dollar libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event no later than december 31, 2021. although regulators in various jurisdictions have been working to replace libor and have encouraged the development and adoption of alternative reference rates, such as the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"), there continues to be uncertainty regarding the nature of potential changes to and future utilization of specific libor tenors, the development and acceptance of alternative reference rates, and other reforms. we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments or other market or regulatory changes related to the phase-out of libor. a transition away from libor as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate may adversely affect our outstanding variable-rate indebtedness (if any) and our variable-rate finance lease, as well as floating-rate debt securities in our investment portfolio. for example, if a published u.s. dollar libor is unavailable or no longer representative, interest for borrowings (if any) with an interest rate based on libor under our revolving credit facility will be determined using various alternative methods, any of which may result in interest obligations which are more than, or do not otherwise correlate over time with, the payments that would have been made on such debt prior to any libor phase-out.
there has been significant volatility in our stock price and generally in the market prices of biotechnology companies' securities. various factors and events may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. these factors include, by way of example:
•if any of our product candidates or our new indications for our marketed products receive regulatory approval, net product sales of, and profits from, these product candidates and new indications;
•whether our net product sales and net profits underperform, meet, or exceed the expectations of investors or analysts;
•announcement of actions by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities or their respective advisory committees regarding our, or our collaborators', or our competitors', currently pending or future application(s) for regulatory approval of product candidate(s) or new indications for marketed products;
•announcement of submission of an application for regulatory approval of one or more of our, or our competitors', product candidates or new indications for marketed products;
•progress, delays, or results in clinical trials of our or our competitors' product candidates or new indications for marketed products;
•announcement of technological innovations or product candidates by us or competitors;
•pricing or reimbursement actions, decisions, or recommendations by government authorities, insurers, or other organizations (such as health maintenance organizations and pbms) affecting the coverage, reimbursement, or use of any of our marketed products or competitors' products;
•our ability to raise additional capital as needed on favorable terms;
•developments in our relationships with collaborators or key customers;
•developments in the biotechnology industry or in government regulation of healthcare, including those relating to compounding (i.e., a practice in which a pharmacist, a physician, or, in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the supervision of a pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a medication tailored to the needs of an individual patient);
•general market conditions;
•our ability to repurchase our common stock under any share repurchase program on favorable terms or at all;
•trading activity that results from the rebalancing of stock indices in which our common stock is included, or the inclusion or exclusion of our common stock from such indices;
•the perception by the investment community or our shareholders of any of the foregoing factors.
the trading price of our common stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to these and other factors, including the sale or attempted sale of a large amount of our common stock in the market. as discussed in greater detail under "future sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new share offerings" below, a large percentage of our common stock is owned by a small number of our principal shareholders. as a result, the public float of our common stock (i.e., the portion of our common stock held by public investors, as opposed to the common stock held by our directors, officers, and principal shareholders) may be lower than the public float of other large public companies with broader public ownership. therefore, the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. these factors may exacerbate the volatility in the trading price of our common stock and may negatively impact your ability to liquidate your investment in regeneron at the time you wish at a price you consider satisfactory. broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. in the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation, which may harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition.
future sales of our common stock by our significant shareholders or us may depress our stock price and impair our ability to raise funds in new share offerings.
a small number of our shareholders beneficially own a substantial amount of our common stock. as of december 31, 2021, our five largest shareholders plus dr. schleifer, our chief executive officer, beneficially owned approximately 38.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock, assuming, in the case of our chief executive officer, the conversion of his class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within 60 days of december 31, 2021. if our significant shareholders or we sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or there is a perception that such sales may occur, the market price of our common stock could fall. sales of common stock by our significant shareholders also might make it more difficult for us to raise funds by selling equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.
in november 2021, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of our common stock (of which $2.845 billion remained available as of december 31, 2021). there can be no assurance of any future share repurchases or share repurchase program authorizations. any share repurchases will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements, our results of operations and financial condition, the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market, and other factors that we may deem relevant. we can provide no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at favorable prices, if at all.
holders of class a stock, who are generally the shareholders who purchased their stock from us before our initial public offering, are entitled to ten votes per share, while holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share. as of december 31, 2021, holders of class a stock held 14.6% of the combined voting power of all shares of common stock and class a stock then outstanding. these shareholders, if acting together, would be in a position to substantially influence the election of our directors and the vote on certain corporate transactions that require majority or supermajority approval of the combined classes, including mergers and other business combinations. this may result in our taking corporate actions that other shareholders may not consider to be in their best interest and may affect the price of our common stock. as of december 31, 2021:
•our current executive officers and directors beneficially owned 7.4% of our outstanding shares of common stock, assuming conversion of their class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days of december 31, 2021, and 18.8% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock, assuming the exercise of all options held by such persons which are exercisable within 60 days of december 31, 2021; and
•our five largest shareholders plus dr. schleifer, our chief executive officer, beneficially owned approximately 38.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock, assuming, in the case of our chief executive officer, the conversion of his class a stock into common stock and the exercise of all options held by him which are exercisable within 60 days of december 31, 2021. in addition, these five shareholders plus our chief executive officer held approximately 45.4% of the combined voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and class a stock, assuming the exercise of all options held by our chief executive officer which are exercisable within 60 days of december 31, 2021.
the anti-takeover effects of provisions of our charter, by-laws, and of new york corporate law, as well as the contractual provisions in our investor and collaboration agreements and certain provisions of our compensation plans and agreements, could deter, delay, or prevent an acquisition or other "change of control" of us and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and the new york business corporation law contain various provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or our management that shareholders may consider favorable or beneficial. some of these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. these provisions include:
•authorization to issue "blank check" preferred stock, which is preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior shareholder approval, with rights senior to those of our common stock and class a stock;
•a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual shareholder meetings to replace all of our directors;
•a requirement that removal of directors may only be effected for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for directors, as well as a requirement that any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors;
•a provision whereby any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting, only if, prior to such action, all of our shareholders consent, the effect of which is to require that shareholder action may only be taken at a duly convened meeting;
•a requirement that any shareholder seeking to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of this intention in writing and meet various other requirements; and
•under the new york business corporation law, in addition to certain restrictions which may apply to "business combinations" involving our company and an "interested shareholder," a plan of merger or consolidation of our company must be approved by two-thirds of the votes of all outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon. see the risk factor above captioned "our existing shareholders may be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval and over our management."
further, sanofi, bayer, and teva are currently bound by certain "standstill" provisions under the january 2014 amended and restated investor agreement between us and sanofi, as amended; our 2016 ang2 license and collaboration agreement and our 2014 pdgfr-beta license and collaboration agreement with bayer; and our 2016 collaboration agreement with teva, respectively. these provisions contractually prohibit sanofi, bayer, and teva from seeking to directly or indirectly exert control of our company or acquiring more than a specified percentage of our class a stock and common stock, taken together (30% in the case of sanofi, 20% in the case of bayer, and 5% in the case of teva).
in addition, our change in control severance plan and the employment agreement with our chief executive officer, each as amended and restated, provide for severance benefits in the event of termination as a result of a change in control of our company. also, equity awards issued under our long-term incentive plans may become fully vested in connection with a "change in control" of our company, as defined in the plans. these contractual provisions may also have the effect of deterring, delaying, or preventing an acquisition or other change in control.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. refer to part ii, item 7 in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2020 (filed with the sec on february 8, 2021) for additional discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019, as well as our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019.
overview regeneron pharmaceuticals, inc. is a fully integrated biotechnology company that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for serious diseases. our commercialized medicines and product candidates in development are designed to help patients with eye diseases, allergic and inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, pain, hematologic conditions, infectious diseases, and rare diseases.
we currently have nine fda-approved products that have received marketing approval and over 30 product candidates in clinical development, almost all of which were homegrown in our laboratories. in addition, regen-cov has not been approved by the fda, but has been authorized under an eua for covid-19 (see part i, item 1. "business - regen-cov - emergency and temporary use authorizations" for a description of recent revisions to the eua to exclude its use in geographic regions where infection or exposure is likely due to a variant that is not susceptible to the treatment). also refer to part i, item 1. "business - products" and "business - programs in clinical development" for additional information related to marketed products and product candidates.
our ability to generate profits and to generate positive cash flow from operations over the next several years depends significantly on the continued success in commercializing eylea and dupixent. we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, a portion of which we expect to be reimbursed by our collaborators. also, our research and development activities outside our collaborations, the costs of which are not reimbursed, are expected to expand and require additional resources. we also expect to incur substantial costs related to the commercialization of our marketed products. our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on, among other factors, the net sales of our products; the scope and progress of our research and development efforts; the timing of certain expenses; the continuation of our collaborations, in particular with sanofi and bayer, including our share of collaboration profits or losses from sales of products and the amount of reimbursement of our research and development expenses that we receive from collaborators; and the amount of income tax expense we incur, which is partly dependent on the profits or losses we earn in each of the countries in which we operate. we cannot predict whether or when new products or new indications for marketed products will receive regulatory approval or, if any such approval is received, whether we will be able to successfully commercialize such product(s) and whether or when they may become profitable.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that impact us is provided in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:
•it requires an assumption (or assumptions) regarding a future outcome; and
•changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions to prepare the estimate could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and, in certain situations, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. the critical accounting estimates that impact our consolidated financial statements are described below.
revenue recognition - product revenue we recognize revenue from product sales at a point in time when our customer is deemed to have obtained control of the product, which generally occurs upon receipt or acceptance by our customer.
the amount of revenue we recognize from product sales may vary due to rebates, chargebacks, and discounts provided under governmental and other programs, distribution-related fees, and other sales-related deductions. in order to determine the transaction price, we estimate, utilizing the expected value method, the amount of variable consideration to which we will be entitled. this estimate is based upon contracts with customers, healthcare providers, payors and government agencies, statutorily-defined discounts applicable to government-funded programs, historical experience, estimated payor mix, and other relevant factors. calculating these provisions involves estimates and judgments. we review our estimates of rebates, chargebacks, and other applicable provisions each period and record any necessary adjustments in the current period's net product sales. refer to the "results of operations - revenues - net product sales" section below for further details regarding our provisions, and credits/payments, for sales-related deductions.
our collaboration agreements may require us to deliver various rights, services, and/or goods across the entire life cycle of a product or product candidate. in agreements involving multiple goods or services promised to be transferred to our collaborator, we must assess, at the inception of the contract, whether each promise represents a separate obligation (i.e., is "distinct"), or whether such promises should be combined as a single unit of account. when we have a combined unit of account which includes a license and providing research and development services to our collaborator, recognition of up-front payments and development milestones earned from our collaborator is deferred (as a liability) and recognized over the development period (i.e., over time). in arrangements where we satisfy our obligation(s) during the development phase over time, we recognize amounts initially deferred over time typically using an input method on the basis of our research and development costs incurred relative to the total expected cost which determines the extent of our progress toward completion. we review our estimates each period and make revisions to such estimates as necessary. due to the variability in the scope of activities and length of time necessary to develop a drug product, potential delays in development programs, changes to development plans and budgets as programs progress, including if we and our collaborators decide to expand or contract our clinical plans for a drug candidate in various disease indications, and uncertainty in the ultimate requirements to obtain governmental approval for commercialization, revisions to our estimates are likely to occur periodically, potentially resulting in material changes to amounts recognized.
when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of the expenses (e.g., research and development expenses) that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts in the period in which such costs are incurred.
if our collaborator performs research and development work or commercialization-related activities and share costs, we also recognize, as expense (e.g., research and development expense or selling, general and administrative expense, as applicable) in the period when our collaborator incurs such expenses, the portion of the collaborator's expenses that we are obligated to reimburse. our collaborators provide us with estimated expenses for the most recent fiscal quarter. the estimates are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual expenses differ from those estimates.
•supply commercial product to our collaborator, we may be reimbursed for our manufacturing costs as commercial product is shipped to the collaborator; however, recognition of such cost reimbursements may be deferred until the product is sold by our collaborator to third-party customers;
•share in any profits or losses arising from the commercialization of such products, we record our share of the variable consideration, representing net product sales less cost of goods sold and shared commercialization and other expenses, in the period in which such underlying sales occur and costs are incurred by the collaborator; and
our collaborators provide us with estimates of product sales and our share of profits or losses, as applicable, for each quarter. the estimates are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if our share of actual profits or losses differ from those estimates.
stock-based compensation we recognize stock-based compensation expense for equity grants under our long-term incentive plans to employees and non-employee members of our board of directors based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. the grant-date fair value of an award is generally recognized as compensation expense over the award's requisite service period.
we use the black-scholes model to compute the estimated fair value of stock option awards. using this model, fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to (i) expected volatility of our common stock price, (ii) the periods of time over which employees and members of our board of directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise (expected lives), (iii) expected dividend yield on our common stock, and (iv) risk-free interest rates, which are based on quoted u.s. treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the options' expected lives. expected volatility has been estimated based on actual movements in our stock price over the most recent historical periods equivalent to the options' expected lives. expected lives are principally based on our historical exercise experience with previously issued employee and board of director option grants. the expected dividend yield is zero as we have never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future.
stock-based compensation expense also includes an estimate, which is made at the time of grant, of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. this estimate is revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
we use a monte carlo simulation to compute the estimated fair value of performance-based restricted stock units, which are subject to vesting based on the company's attainment of pre-established market performance goals.
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of equity awards reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. changes in any of these assumptions may materially affect the fair value of awards granted and the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in future periods.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns, including deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected amounts of global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") inclusions. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined as the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts ("temporary differences") at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. we periodically re-assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, results of recent operations, and our historical earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction. significant judgment is required in making this assessment.
uncertain tax positions, for which management's assessment is that there is more than a 50% probability that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority based upon its technical merits, are subjected to certain recognition and measurement criteria. significant judgment is required in making this assessment, and, therefore, we re-evaluate uncertain tax positions and consider various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. we adjust the amount of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the uncertain positions.
inventories we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized; otherwise, such costs are expensed. the determination to capitalize inventory costs is based on various factors, including status and expectations of the regulatory approval process, any known safety or efficacy concerns, potential labeling restrictions, and any other impediments to obtaining regulatory approval.
we periodically analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, and write down such inventories as appropriate. in addition, our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process. if certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration, we record a charge to write down such inventory to its estimated realizable value.
see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for information related to our inventory write-offs and reserves.
contingencies we accrue, based on management's judgment, for an estimated loss when the potential loss from claims or legal proceedings is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. as additional information becomes available, or, based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation, and may change our estimates.
net product sales in the united states:
* net product sales of praluent in the united states were recorded by sanofi prior to april 1, 2020.
** effective april 1, 2021, kiniksa records net product sales of arcalyst in the united states.
net product sales net product sales of eylea in the united states increased in 2021, compared to 2020, due to higher sales volume (including the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic on u.s. eylea demand during the three months ended june 30, 2020), partly offset by an increase in sales-related deductions.
during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, net product sales of regen-cov were recorded in connection with our agreements with the u.s. government. as of december 31, 2021, the company had completed its final deliveries of drug product under its agreements with the u.s. government. refer to part i, item 1. "business - agreements related to covid-19 - u.s. government" for further details. the degree to which future sales of our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies will continue is highly uncertain and will depend on, among other factors, the number of new covid-19 cases and effectiveness of our product against variants of concern. refer to part i, item 1. "business - products - regen-cov - emergency and temporary use authorizations" for additional information.
revenue from product sales is recorded net of applicable provisions for rebates, chargebacks, and discounts; distribution-related fees; and other sales-related deductions. the following table summarizes the provisions, and credits/payments, for sales-related deductions.

(1) corresponding costs incurred by us in connection with such production is recorded within cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing antibody the increase in our share of profits in connection with commercialization of antibodies in 2021, compared to 2020, was driven by higher dupixent profits.
during each of the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, the company earned $50.0 million sales-based milestones from sanofi, upon aggregate annual sales of antibodies outside the united states (including praluent) exceeding $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, on a rolling twelve-month basis. we are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $150.0 million in additional milestone payments from sanofi, which includes the next sales milestone payment of $50.0 million that would be earned when such sales outside the united states exceed $2.0 billion on a rolling twelve-month basis.
regeneron's share of profits in connection with the commercialization of dupixent, praluent (through march 31, 2020), and kevzara is summarized below:

(1) global net product sales of dupixent and kevzara are recorded by sanofi. the quarter ended march 31, 2020 was the last quarter for which sanofi and the company shared profits and losses in connection with sanofi's global net sales and the related commercialization of praluent (see further details below); therefore, the quarter ended march 31, 2020 was the last quarter for which net product sales of praluent were included in the table above.
as described in part i, item 1. "business - collaboration, license, and other agreements - sanofi - antibody", effective april 1, 2020, the company became solely responsible for the development and commercialization of praluent in the united states. under the new agreement, sanofi is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of praluent outside of the united states, and pays the company a 5% royalty on sanofi's net product sales of praluent outside the united states.
regeneron's net profit in connection with commercialization of eylea outside the united states                                          $1,349.2                                              $1,107.9                                              $1,091.4
(1) corresponding costs incurred by us in connection with such production is recorded within cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing bayer records net product sales of eylea outside the united states. regeneron's net profit in connection with commercialization of eylea outside the united states is summarized below:

roche collaboration revenue as described in part i, item 1. "business - agreements related to covid-19 - roche", roche distributes and records net product sales of the casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail outside the united states, and the parties share gross profits from worldwide sales, depending on the amount of manufactured product supplied by each party to the market. each quarter, a single payment is due from one party to the other to true-up the global gross profits between the parties. if regeneron is to receive a true-up payment from roche, such amount will be recorded to other collaboration revenue. if regeneron is to make a true-up payment to roche, such amount will be recorded to cost of goods sold.
during the year ended december 31, 2021, the company recorded $361.8 million of true-up payments, within other collaboration revenue, from roche in connection with this agreement.
other revenue other revenue decreased in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to lower amounts recognized in connection with our agreement with barda related to funding of certain development activities for covid-19 antibodies, and, to a lesser extent, inmazeb.
(2) cost of goods sold primarily includes costs in connection with producing commercial supplies for products that are sold by regeneron in the united states (i.e., for which we record net product sales), any royalties we are obligated to pay on such sales, and amounts we are obligated to pay to collaborators for their share of gross profits.
(3) cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing includes costs we incur in connection with producing commercial drug supplies for collaborators and others.
operating expenses in 2021, 2020, and 2019 included a total of $601.7 million, $432.0 million, and $464.3 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense related to equity awards granted under our long-term incentive plans. as of december 31, 2021, unrecognized non-cash compensation expense related to unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock (including performance-based restricted stock units) was $515.9 million and $857.1 million, respectively. we expect to recognize this non-cash compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock over weighted-average periods of 1.8 years and 3.0 years, respectively.
research and development expenses the following table summarizes our estimates of direct research and development expenses by clinical development program and other significant categories of research and development expenses. direct research and development expenses are comprised primarily of costs paid to third parties for clinical and product development activities, including costs related to preclinical research activities, clinical trials, and the portion of research and development expenses incurred by our collaborators that we are obligated to reimburse. indirect research and development expenses have not been allocated directly to each program, and primarily consist of costs to compensate personnel, overhead and infrastructure costs to maintain our facilities, and other costs related to activities that benefit multiple projects. clinical manufacturing costs primarily consist of costs to manufacture bulk drug product for clinical development purposes as well as related external drug filling, packaging, and labeling costs. clinical manufacturing costs also includes pre-launch commercial supplies which did not meet the criteria to be capitalized as inventory (see "critical accounting policies and use of estimates - inventories" above). the table below also includes reimbursements of research and development expenses by collaborators, as when we are entitled to reimbursement of all or a portion of such expenses that we incur under a collaboration, we record those reimbursable amounts in the period in which such costs are incurred.
payroll and benefits                                                                                     981.4                             816.6                             705.8                             164.8                               110.8
* certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation research and development expenses in 2021 included $34.0 million in aggregate up-front payments in connection with our collaboration agreement with nykode therapeutics, in 2020 included $85.0 million in aggregate up-front payments in connection with our collaboration agreement with intellia, and in 2019 included a $400.0 million up-front payment to alnylam. research and development expenses included non-cash compensation expense of $316.6 million and $238.6 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
there are numerous uncertainties associated with drug development, including uncertainties related to safety and efficacy data from each phase of drug development, uncertainties related to the enrollment and performance of clinical trials, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in the competitive landscape affecting a product candidate, and other risks and uncertainties described in part i, item 1a. "risk factors" (including those relating to the disruptions caused by the covid-19 pandemic). there is also variability in the duration and costs necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product, potential opportunities and/or uncertainties related to future indications to be studied, and the estimated cost and scope of the projects. the lengthy process of seeking fda and other applicable approvals, and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. any failure by us to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business. we are unable to reasonably estimate if our product candidates in clinical development will generate material product revenues and net cash inflows.
selling, general, and administrative expenses selling, general, and administrative expenses increased in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to an increase in commercialization-related expenses for (i) eylea, including direct-to-consumer advertising, (ii) regen-cov, including costs associated with educational campaigns related to covid-19, and (iii) libtayo; and higher headcount-related costs. in addition, in 2020, we recorded a reversal of accruals for litigation-related loss contingencies as a result of the october 2020 ruling by the technical board of appeal of the epo and its impact on certain patent infringement actions in europe relating to praluent (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details). selling, general, and administrative expenses also included $213.3 million and $153.0 million of non-cash compensation expense in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to the recognition of manufacturing costs in connection with the product sales of regen-cov. during 2021, the company also recorded a $259.6 million true-up payment owed in connection with global gross profits under our roche collaboration agreement described above. additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2021, the company recorded a $231.7 million charge to write down its regen-cov inventory as a result of data that showed regen-cov was highly unlikely to be active against the omicron variant and the fda revision of the eua for regen-cov, pursuant to which regen-cov was no longer authorized for use in any u.s. states, territories, or jurisdictions. refer to part i, item 1. "business - products - regen-cov - emergency and temporary use authorizations" for additional information.
cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing increased in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to the recognition of manufacturing costs associated with higher sales of dupixent, partly offset by lower costs in connection with manufacturing ex-u.s. commercial supplies of praluent for sanofi and the recognition of process validation costs during 2020 in connection with manufacturing inmazeb under our barda agreement as such costs did not recur during 2021.
other operating (income) expense other operating (income) expense, net, includes recognition of a portion of amounts previously deferred in connection with up-front and development milestone payments, as applicable, received in connection with sanofi io, teva, and mtpc collaborative arrangements. in these arrangements, we satisfy our obligation(s) during the development phase over time, and, as a result, recognize amounts initially deferred over time using an input method on the basis of our research and development costs incurred relative to the total expected cost which determines the extent of our progress toward completion. see the critical accounting policies and use of estimates section above for further details.
during 2021, we updated our estimate of the total research and development costs expected to be incurred (which resulted in a change to the estimate of the stage of completion) in connection with the sanofi io collaboration, and, as a result, recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment of $66.9 million as a reduction to other operating income. during 2020, we updated our estimate of the total research and development costs expected to be incurred (which resulted in changes to the estimate of the stage of completion) in connection with the sanofi io, teva, and mtpc collaboration agreements, and therefore recorded cumulative catch-up adjustments of $99.8 million, net, as an increase to other operating income.
other income (expense), net, was $379.0 million in 2021, compared to $233.8 million in 2020. this change was primarily driven by an increase in unrealized gains on equity securities of $190.1 million.
our effective tax rate for 2021 was positively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily by income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate and stock-based compensation. our effective tax rate for 2020 was positively impacted, compared to the u.s. federal statutory rate, primarily by stock-based compensation, and, to a lesser extent, federal tax credits for research activities and income earned in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate.

cash flows from operating activities
as of december 31, 2021, accounts receivable had increased by $1.927 billion, compared to december 31, 2020, primarily due to regen-cov sales in connection with our september 2021 agreement to supply drug product to the u.s. government. other non-cash items, net, in 2021 included inventory write-offs and reserves totaling $457.1 million, primarily related to regen-cov. accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities as of december 31, 2021 included a $259.6 million fourth quarter 2021 true-up payment owed in connection with global gross profits under our roche collaboration agreement.
as of december 31, 2020, accounts receivable had increased by $1.356 billion, compared to december 31, 2019, partly as a result of extending payment terms to eylea customers due to the covid-19 pandemic. inventories increased as of december 31, 2020, compared to december 31, 2019, partially as a result of purchasing additional raw materials in anticipation of potential disruptions to our supply chain due to the covid-19 pandemic.
deferred taxes as of december 31, 2019 increased by $130.6 million, compared to december 31, 2018, primarily due to the tax treatment of the up-front payment made to alnylam and non-cash compensation expense. accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities as of december 31, 2019 increased compared to december 31, 2018 partially due to the impact of the receipt of a $461.9 million payment from sanofi in connection with the termination of the 2015 io discovery agreement.
cash flows from investing activities sales of marketable securities in 2020 included proceeds in connection with funding our stock repurchase from sanofi (as described below). in 2019, we purchased $400.0 million of alnylam common stock in connection with entering into the collaboration agreement. capital expenditures in 2021 included costs associated with the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in rensselaer, new york (including the ongoing construction of a fill/finish facility and related equipment) and limerick, ireland, as well as initial costs incurred in connection with our planned expansion of the tarrytown, new york campus. we expect to incur capital expenditures of $650 million to $730 million in 2022 primarily in connection with the continued expansion of our manufacturing facilities (including the fill/finish facility) and the expansion of our research, preclinical manufacturing, and support facilities at our tarrytown, new york campus. we also expect continued significant capital expenditures over the next several years in connection with the planned expansion of our tarrytown, new york campus.
cash flows from financing activities proceeds from issuances of common stock, in connection with exercises of employee stock options, were $1.672 billion during 2021, compared to $2.575 billion during 2020 and $211.8 million during 2019. for additional information related to cash flows from financing activities, see "share repurchase program", "sanofi funding of certain development costs", "secondary offering and purchase of regeneron common stock held by sanofi", and "issuance of senior notes" sections below.
credit facility in december 2018, we entered into an agreement with a syndicate of lenders (the "credit agreement") which provides for a $750.0 million senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "credit facility"). the credit agreement includes an option for us to elect to increase the commitments under the credit facility and/or to enter into one or more tranches of term loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million, subject to the consent of the lenders providing the additional commitments or term loans, as applicable, and certain other conditions. proceeds of the loans under the credit facility may be used to finance working capital needs, and for general corporate or other lawful purposes, of regeneron and its subsidiaries. the credit agreement also provides a $50.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. the credit agreement includes an option for us to elect to extend the maturity date of the credit facility beyond december 2023, subject to the consent of the extending lenders and certain other conditions. amounts borrowed under the credit facility may be prepaid, and the commitments under the credit facility may be terminated, at any time without premium or penalty. we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december 31, 2021.
the credit agreement contains financial and operating covenants. financial covenants include a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest expense coverage ratio. we were in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility as of december 31, 2021.
share repurchase programs in november 2019, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. the share repurchase program permitted the company to make repurchases through a variety of methods, including open-market transactions (including pursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with rule 10b5-1 of the exchange act), privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases, block trades, and other transactions in compliance with rule 10b-18 of the exchange act. as of december 31, 2020, the company had repurchased the entire $1.0 billion of its common stock that it was authorized to repurchase under the program.
in january 2021, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock. the share repurchase program was approved under terms substantially similar to the november 2019 share repurchase program. as of december 31, 2021, the company had repurchased the entire $1.5 billion of its common stock that it was authorized to repurchase under the program.
in november 2021, our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of our common stock. the share repurchase program was approved under terms substantially similar to the share repurchase programs above. repurchases may be made from time to time at management's discretion, and the timing and amount of any such repurchases will be determined based on share price, market conditions, legal requirements, and other relevant factors. the program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. there can be no assurance as to the timing or number of shares of any repurchases in the future. we plan to finance the share repurchase program with available cash. as of december 31, 2021, $2.845 billion remained available for share repurchases under the november 2021 program.
sanofi funding of certain development costs pursuant to a 2018 agreement, we agreed to allow sanofi to satisfy in whole or in part its funding obligations with respect to libtayo development and/or certain activities relating to dupilumab and itepekimab incurred in periods through september 30, 2020 by selling shares of our common stock owned by sanofi. during 2020, sanofi elected to sell, and we elected to purchase, shares of our common stock to satisfy sanofi's funding obligation related to such activities. consequently, we recorded the cost of the shares received, or $135.0 million, as treasury stock during 2020. in addition, during 2019, sanofi elected to sell, and we elected to purchase, shares of our common stock to satisfy sanofi's funding obligation. consequently, we recorded the cost of the shares received, or $102.7 million, as treasury stock during 2019.
secondary offering and purchase of regeneron common stock held by sanofi in may 2020, a secondary offering of 13,014,646 shares of our common stock (the "secondary offering") held by sanofi was completed. in connection with the secondary offering, we also purchased 9,806,805 shares of our common stock directly from sanofi for an aggregate purchase amount of $5.0 billion (the "stock purchase").
we funded the stock purchase with a combination of cash on hand, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, and proceeds from loans under a $1.5 billion senior unsecured bridge loan facility (the "bridge facility") which was entered into in may 2020. the bridge facility was repaid in august 2020 following the issuance and sale of the company's senior unsecured notes.
issuance of senior notes in august 2020, we issued and sold $1.250 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2030 (the "2030 notes") and $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2050 (the "2050 notes" and, together with the 2030 notes, the "notes"). net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the notes (after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses) were used in part to repay in full the bridge facility described above, including accrued interest and related fees and expenses in connection therewith.
the 2030 notes accrue interest at the rate of 1.750% per year and will mature on september 15, 2030. the 2050 notes accrue interest at the rate of 2.800% per year and will mature on september 15, 2050. interest on each series of notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year until their respective maturity dates.
the notes may be redeemed at the company's option at any time at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, and, until a specified period before maturity, a specified make-whole amount. the notes contain a change-of-control provision that, under certain circumstances, may require the company to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
the notes also contain certain limitations on the company's ability to incur liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, as well as customary events of default.
tarrytown, new york leases we lease laboratory and office facilities in tarrytown, new york (the "facility"). in 2016, we entered into a purchase agreement with the then lessor, pursuant to which we agreed to purchase the facility for a purchase price of $720.0 million. in march 2017, we entered into a participation agreement with ba leasing bsc, lcc, and affiliate of banc of america leasing & capital, llc ("bal"), as lessor, and a syndicate of lenders (collectively with bal, the "lease participants"), which provided for lease financing in connection with the acquisition by bal of the facility and our lease of the facility from bal. in march 2017, we assigned our right to take title to the facility under the purchase agreement to bal, and the lease participants advanced $720.0 million, which was used by bal to finance the purchase price for the facility.
concurrent with entering into the participation agreement, we also entered into a lease agreement (the "lease") for the facility with bal for a five-year term ending in march 2022. the lease requires us to pay all maintenance, insurance, taxes, and other costs arising out of the use of the facility. we are also required to make monthly payments of basic rent during the term of the lease in an amount equal to a variable rate per annum based on the one-month libor, plus an applicable margin that varies with our debt rating and total leverage ratio.
the participation agreement and the lease include an option for us to elect to extend the maturity date of the participation agreement and the term of the lease for an additional five-year period, subject to the consent of all the lease participants and certain other conditions. we also have the option prior to the end of the term of the lease to (a) purchase the facility by paying an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the lease participants' advances under the participation agreement, all accrued and unpaid interest and yield thereon, and all other outstanding amounts under the participation agreement, the lease, and certain related documents or (b) sell the facility to a third party on behalf of bal. the advances under the participation agreement mature, and all amounts outstanding thereunder will become due and payable in full at the end of the term of the lease.
in september 2021, we delivered a request to the lease participants to potentially exercise the option for a five-year extension of the term of the lease and the maturity date under the participation agreement. in november 2021, the lease participants consented to such extension, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions prior to the expiration of the existing term in march 2022, including the negotiation and execution of satisfactory definitive documentation setting forth the terms and conditions that would apply during such potential extended term. we are negotiating such documentation with the lease participants, but there can be no assurance that such extension will become effective.
the agreements governing the lease financing contain financial and operating covenants. such financial covenants and certain of the operating covenants are substantially similar to the covenants set forth in our credit facility. we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31, 2021.
additional funding requirements the amount required to fund operations will depend on various factors, including the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates and the timing thereof and the extent and cost of our research and development programs. we believe that our existing capital resources, borrowing availability under the credit facility, funds generated by anticipated product sales, and, as described above under part i, item 1. "business - collaboration, license, and other agreements," funding for reimbursement of research and development costs that we are entitled to receive under our collaboration agreements, will enable us to meet our anticipated operating needs for the foreseeable future.
we expect continued increases in our expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities (including preclinical and clinical programs). the amount of funding that will be required for our clinical programs depends upon the results of our research and preclinical programs and early-stage clinical trials, regulatory requirements, the duration and results of clinical trials underway and of additional clinical trials that we decide to initiate, and the various factors that affect the cost of each trial, including the size of trials, fees charged for services provided by clinical trial investigators and other third parties, the costs for manufacturing the product candidate for use in the trials, and other expenses. under certain collaboration agreements, the amount of funding for reimbursement of research and development costs that we are entitled to receive is capped at a specified amount; therefore, we may elect to independently fund certain research and development costs in excess of such capped amounts.
we expect to continue to incur development and manufacturing costs for our covid-19 monoclonal antibodies in 2022, though the amount of funding that will be required will be subject to clinical data results, quantity of drug supply manufactured, the duration of the covid-19 pandemic, and other factors, including regulatory outcomes, as described in part i.
we anticipate continuing to incur substantial commercialization costs for eylea, dupixent, and libtayo. commercialization costs over the next few years will depend on, among other things, the market potential for product candidates, whether commercialization costs are shared with a collaborator, and regulatory approval of additional product candidates.
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $410.9 million at december 31, 2021. due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the period and amounts of potential future cash settlement with tax authorities. see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. in addition, the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses effective for years beginning after december 31, 2021, which we expect will have a material impact on our cash flows beginning in 2022.
under our collaboration with bayer for eylea outside the united states and our antibody and io collaborations with sanofi, we and our collaborator share profits and losses in connection with commercialization of drug products. if the applicable collaboration is profitable, we have contingent contractual obligations to reimburse bayer and sanofi for a defined percentage (generally 50%) of agreed-upon development expenses funded by bayer and sanofi (i.e., "development balance"). these reimbursements are deducted each quarter, in accordance with a formula, from our share of the collaboration profits (and, for our eylea collaboration with bayer, inclusive of our percentage on product sales in japan) otherwise payable to us, unless, in the case of eylea, we elect to reimburse these expenses at a faster rate. as of december 31, 2021, our contingent reimbursement obligation to bayer for eylea was approximately $282 million and our contingent reimbursement obligation to sanofi in connection with the companies' antibody collaboration and io collaboration was approximately $3.152 billion and $103 million, respectively. therefore, we expect that, for the foreseeable future, a portion of our share of profits from sales under our collaborations with bayer and sanofi will be used to reimburse our collaborators for these obligations.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
future impact of recently issued accounting standards as of december 31, 2021, the future adoption of recently issued accounting standards is not expected to have a material impact on the company's financial position or results of operations.

item 1a.    risk factors our business is subject to many risks. set forth below are the material risks we face. risks are listed in the categories where they primarily apply, but other categories may also apply.
competitive and reputational risks our continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of target which, if eroded, could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our guests and team members.
we believe that one of the reasons our shareholders, guests, team members, and vendors choose target is the positive reputation we have built over many years for serving those constituencies and the communities in which we operate. to be successful in the future, we must continue to preserve target's reputation. our reputation is based in large part on perceptions, both about us and others with whom we do business, and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of target. it may be difficult to control negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. target's responses to crises and our position or perceived lack of position on environmental, social, and governance (esg) matters, such as sustainability, responsible sourcing, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (de&i), and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation. while reputations may take decades to build, negative incidents involving us or others with whom we do business can quickly erode trust and confidence and can result in consumer boycotts, workforce unrest or walkouts, government investigations, or litigation. for example, we have a limited ability to end our relationship with cvs, which leases space to operate their clinics and pharmacies within our stores. if our guests have negative experiences with or unfavorably view cvs or other companies with whom we have relationships, it could cause them to reduce or stop their business with us. negative reputational incidents could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including through lost sales, loss of new store and development opportunities, or team member retention and recruiting difficulties.
if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests' shopping experience through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, store environment, convenience, guest service, loyalty programs, and marketing efforts. guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores, the environmental impact of our business, the functionality, reliability, and speed of our digital channels and fulfillment options, our in-stock levels, the value and exclusivity of our offerings, and our efforts to source merchandise responsibly and ethically are among the factors that affect our ability to compete. in addition, our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers. no single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could adversely affect our sales, gross margins, and expenses.
the retail industry's continuing migration to digital channels has affected the ways we differentiate from other retailers. in particular, consumers can quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine real-time product availability using digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price or the functionality of the digital tools. consumers may also use third-party channels or devices, such as voice assistants and smart home devices, to initiate shopping searches and place orders, which could sometimes make us dependent on the capabilities and search algorithms of those third parties to reach those consumers. any difficulties in executing our differentiation efforts or actions by our competitors in response to these efforts could adversely affect our sales, gross margins, and expenses.
our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interacting with guests across multiple channels (in-store, online, mobile, and social media, among others). our guests are using those channels to shop with us and provide feedback and public commentary about our business. we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectations and counteract developments and investments by our competitors. our evolving retailing efforts include implementing technology, software, and processes to be able to conveniently and cost-effectively fulfill guest orders directly from any point within our system of stores and distribution centers and our vendors. we also need to collect accurate, relevant, and usable guest data to personalize our offerings. providing multiple fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet expectations for accurate order fulfillment, faster and guaranteed delivery times, low-cost or free shipping, and desired payment methods. even when we are successful in meeting fulfillment expectations, if we are unable to offset increased costs of fulfilling orders outside of our traditional in-store channel with efficiencies, cost-savings, or expense reductions, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
if we do not anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, our sales and profitability could suffer.
a large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend-right decisions and effectively manage our inventory in a broad range of merchandise categories, including apparel, accessories, home décor, electronics, toys, seasonal offerings, food and beverage, and others. if we do not obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preferences, predict and quickly respond to changing consumer preferences, spending patterns, and other lifestyle decisions, emphasize the correct categories, implement competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategies, or personalize our offerings to our guests, we may experience lost sales, spoilage, and increased inventory markdowns, which could adversely affect our results of operations. during the covid-19 pandemic, many guests significantly reduced their spending on dining, travel, lodging, and other leisure activities outside their homes, which may have contributed to our increased sales, particularly for essential items and merchandise associated with guests spending more time at home. if we are unable to effectively adapt if or when guests increase spending on other categories, it could lead to lower sales and adversely affect our results of operations.
investments and infrastructure risks if our capital investments in remodeling existing stores, building new stores, improving technology, and expanding our supply chain infrastructure do not achieve appropriate returns, our competitive position, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
our business depends, in part, on our ability to remodel existing stores and build new stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment. our store remodel program uses a custom approach based on the characteristics of each store and surrounding neighborhood, and is expected to be a continuous part of our operations to allow us to meet evolving expectations for in-store experience, fulfillment, and other changes in our business over time. when building new stores, we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. pursuing the wrong remodel or new store opportunities and any delays, cost increases, disruptions, or other uncertainties related to those opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations.
we are making, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in technology and replenishment and fulfillment infrastructure to improve guest experiences across multiple channels, improve the speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of our supply chain and inventory management systems, and support our current and expected sales levels. the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than remodeling stores, and might not provide the anticipated benefits.
pursuing the wrong investment opportunities, being unable to make new concepts scalable, or misjudging our replenishment and fulfillment capacity needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k risk factors index to financial statements a significant disruption in our computer systems and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could adversely affect our operations and negatively affect our guests.
we rely extensively on computer systems throughout our business. we also rely on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer systems. an increase in remote working arrangements by our team members, vendors, and other third parties, which was accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic, has amplified our already extensive reliance on computer systems and on our continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use those systems, as well as the risks related to that reliance. our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malicious attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events, and implementation errors. if our systems are damaged, disrupted, or fail to function properly or reliably, we may incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss or theft and impediments to our ability to manage inventories or process guest transactions, and encounter lost guest confidence, which could require additional promotional activities to attract guests and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. we continually invest to maintain and update our computer systems. implementing significant system changes increases the risk of computer system disruption. the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives, as well as providing training and support for those initiatives, could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency, and could negatively impact guest experiences and guest confidence. for example, in the past, we have experienced disruptions in our point-of-sale system that prevented our ability to process debit or credit transactions, negatively impacted some guests' experiences, and generated negative publicity.
information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy risks if our efforts to provide information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy are unsuccessful or if we are unable to meet increasingly demanding regulatory requirements, we may face additional costly government enforcement actions and private litigation, and our reputation and results of operations could suffer.
we regularly receive and store information about our guests, team members, vendors, and other third parties. we have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors, and vendors.
the increase in remote working arrangements by our team members, vendors, and other third parties also increases the risk of a data security compromise and the possible attack surfaces. although we conduct training as part of our information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy efforts, that training cannot be completely effective in preventing those attacks from being successful.
our only significant data security incident was a data breach that occurred in 2013 and went undetected for several weeks. both we and our vendors have experienced data security incidents since that data breach; however, to date, these other incidents have not been material to our results of operations. based on the prominence and notoriety of our prior significant data breach, even minor additional data security incidents could draw greater scrutiny. if we, our vendors, or other third parties with whom we do business experience additional significant data security incidents or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant incidents, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation. in addition, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, stop using our redcards or loyalty programs, or stop shopping with us altogether, which could adversely affect our reputation, sales, and results of operations.
the legal and regulatory environment regarding information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy is dynamic, increasingly demanding, and has enhanced requirements for using and treating personal data. complying with current or contemplated data protection laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs, require changes to our business practices, limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a differentiated guest experience, and expose us to further litigation and regulatory risks, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k risk factors index to financial statements supply chain and third-party risks changes in our relationships with our vendors, changes in tax or trade policy, interruptions in our operations or supply chain, or increased commodity or supply chain costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
we are dependent on our vendors, including common carriers, to supply merchandise to our distribution centers, stores, and guests. as we continue to add capabilities to quickly move the appropriate amount of inventory at optimal operational costs through our supply chain, operating our replenishment and fulfillment network becomes more complex and challenging. if our replenishment and fulfillment network does not operate properly, if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, or if common carriers have difficulty providing capacity to meet demands for their services like they experienced at times during 2020 and 2021, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks, delivery delays or increased delivery costs, which could lead to lost sales and decreased guest confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.
a large portion of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the u.s., with china as our single largest source. any major changes in tax or trade policy, such as the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, between the u.s. and countries from which we source merchandise could require us to take certain actions, including for example raising prices on products we sell and seeking alternative sources of supply from vendors in other countries with whom we have less familiarity, which could adversely affect our reputation, sales, and our results of operations.
political or financial instability, currency fluctuations, the outbreak of pandemics or other illnesses (such as the covid-19 pandemic), labor shortages, labor unrest and activism, transport capacity and costs, inflation, port security, weather conditions, natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other events that could alter or suspend our operations, slow or disrupt port activities, or affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise, increase our costs, and/or adversely affect our results of operations. there have been periodic closings and ship diversions, labor disputes, and congestion disrupting u.s. ports, including those in california where we receive a significant portion of the products we source from outside the u.s. in addition, some vendors have had difficulty supplying us products in the quantities we seek. the combination of port disruptions, the covid-19 pandemic, and other events in our supply chain have caused us to make alternative arrangements to continue the flow of inventory, and if these types of events recur, worsen, or occur in other countries through which we source products, it may have a material impact on our costs or inventory supply. changes in the costs of procuring commodities used in our merchandise or the costs related to our supply chain could adversely affect our results of operations.
we rely on third parties to support our business, including portions of our technology infrastructure, development, and support; our digital platforms; our replenishment and fulfillment operations; store and supply chain infrastructure construction and remodel program; credit and debit card transaction processing; extensions of credit for our redcard program; infrastructure supporting our guest contact centers; aspects of our food offerings; and delivery services. if we are unable to contract with third parties having the specialized skills needed to support those strategies or integrate their products and services with our business, or if they fail to meet our performance standards and expectations, then our reputation and results of operations could be adversely affected.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k risk factors index to financial statements legal, regulatory, global, and other external risks the ongoing and evolving covid-19 pandemic may continue to amplify the risks and uncertainties facing our business and their potential impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
the covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve, with pockets of resurgence and the emergence of variant strains contributing to continued uncertainty about its duration, severity, and lasting impact. governments have taken various measures in response to covid-19, including mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings. in addition, we have incurred significant expenses related to efforts to protect the health and well-being of our guests and team members. nearly all of our stores, digital channels, and distribution centers have remained open during the covid-19 pandemic, though at times we have had to temporarily alter other parts of our operations, including adjusting our in-store returns process, suspending physical inventory counts at our stores, metering guest traffic, reducing store hours, and, in some locations, restricting access to "non-essential" sections of our stores due to emergency operating restrictions. those temporary alterations to our operations have at times adversely affected, and could again in the future, either alone or with any negative guest or team member perceptions about the cleanliness and safety of our stores, adversely affect the guest experience, sales, and our results of operations.
different covid-19 vaccines and boosters have been developed and are being distributed. as additional covid-19 response measures, in certain jurisdictions, we are subject to vaccine mandates that apply to our team members, guests, and/or others who are in our stores and other buildings. we may be subject to similar or additional measures as the covid-19 pandemic continues. our implementation of these mandates and any requirements for showing compliance with them, may result in team member dissatisfaction or unrest, attrition of existing team members, difficulty in attracting new team members, inefficiencies related to team member turnover, increased costs related to ongoing compliance, scheduling disruptions, and negative guest perceptions or experiences, which could adversely affect our reputation, sales and results of operations.
the full extent of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, financial position, and results of operations will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control, including the duration and spread of the covid-19 pandemic, the emergence of variant strains, the availability, adoption, and effectiveness of the covid-19 vaccines and covid-19 testing, and government actions, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. the fluidity of this situation limits our ability to predict the ultimate impact of covid-19 on our business, financial condition, and financial performance, which could be material.
our earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence in the u.s.
nearly all of our sales are in the u.s., making our results highly dependent on the health of the u.s. economy and u.s. consumer confidence, which can be affected by a variety of factors, including housing prices, unemployment rates, and inflation. a deterioration in u.s. macroeconomic conditions or consumer confidence, the likelihood of which is made more uncertain by the unknown duration, severity, and lasting impact of the covid-19 pandemic and recent increases in the inflation rate, could adversely affect our business in many ways, including slowing sales growth, reducing overall sales, and reducing gross margins.
such a deterioration could adversely affect additional areas of our business, such as asset impairment evaluations and the amount of credit card profit-sharing revenue payments we receive under our credit card program with td bank group (td), which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit cards. we could also receive lower profit-sharing payments if changes in consumer preferences regarding use of revolving credit cards adversely affect the volume of new credit accounts, the amount of credit card program balances, and/or the ability of credit card holders to pay their balances.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k risk factors index to financial statements uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, natural disasters, and other catastrophic events could adversely affect our results of operations.
uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, including the impacts of climate change, can affect consumer shopping patterns, particularly in apparel and seasonal items, which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short-term results of operations. in addition, three of our largest states by total sales are california, texas, and florida, areas where natural disasters are more prevalent. natural disasters in those states or in other areas where our sales or operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores, distribution centers, facilities, or key vendors. in addition, weather conditions, natural disasters, and other catastrophic events, such as the covid-19 pandemic, in areas where we or our vendors have operations, could adversely affect the availability or cost of certain products within our supply chain, cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers, stores, and guests, affect consumer purchasing power, or reduce consumer demand, which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs and lowering our sales.
with over 400,000 team members, our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense, and our business is dependent on our ability to attract, train, and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team members, contractors, and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resources as our business and strategic priorities change. many team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high turnover rates. our ability to meet our changing labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as labor laws and regulations, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, benefit costs, changing demographics, and our reputation and relevance within the labor market. our ability to meet those labor needs could be further strained by expanded laws, regulations, and mandates adopted in connection with the covid-19 pandemic. if we are unable to attract and retain a workforce meeting our needs, our operations, guest service levels, support functions, and competitiveness could suffer and our results of operations could be adversely affected. we are periodically subject to labor organizing efforts and activism, which could negatively impact how we are perceived by team members and our overall reputation. if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could adversely affect our labor costs, how we operate our business, and our results of operations. in addition to our united states operations, we have support offices in india and china, and any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations, whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise, could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or target's or our guests' expectations regarding safety, supply chain transparency, and responsible sourcing, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns, including food or drug contamination and product defects, could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. our sourcing vendors, including any third parties selling through our digital channels, must also meet our expectations across multiple areas of social compliance, including supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing. we have a social compliance audit process that performs audits regularly, but we cannot continuously monitor every vendor, so we are also dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with our standards. if we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity, the risk of our standards not being met may increase. expectations from shareholders, guests, team members, and other third parties concerning esg reporting have increased, and our ability to meet those expectations is dependent on a variety of factors, including cooperation from sourcing vendors and other third parties and having access to consistent and reliable data. negative guest perceptions regarding the safety and sourcing of the products we sell and the sufficiency and transparency of our reporting on esg matters, and events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived compliance and social responsibility concerns could hurt our reputation, result in lost sales, cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs, and make it difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k risk factors &amp; unresolved staff comments index to financial statements our failure to comply with applicable laws, or changes in these laws could increase our costs, reduce our margins, and lower our sales.
our expenses could increase and our operations could be adversely affected by law changes or adverse judicial developments involving an employer's obligation to recognize collective bargaining units, minimum wage requirements, advance scheduling notice requirements, health care or other mandates, the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees, and the classification of workers as either employees or independent contractors (particularly as it applies to our shipt subsidiary, a technology company that connects shipt members through its online marketplace with a network of independent contractors who select, purchase, and deliver groceries and household essentials ordered from target and other retailers). the classification of workers as employees or independent contractors, in particular, is an area that is experiencing legal challenges and legislative changes. if our shipt subsidiary is required to treat its independent contractor network as employees, it could result in higher compensation and benefit costs.
changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting information security, cybersecurity and data privacy, product safety, payment methods and related fees, responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, environmental protection, waste management, climate change, or other esg matters, among others, could cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices. in addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to reputation and legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations by increasing our costs, reducing our margins, and lowering our sales.
financial risks increases in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our business, results of operations, liquidity, and net income.
several factors influence our effective income tax rate, including tax laws and regulations, the related interpretations, and our ability to sustain our reporting positions on examination. changes in any of those factors could change our effective tax rate, which could adversely affect our net income. in addition, changes in our operations both in and outside of the u.s. may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate.
if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit, our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations could suffer.
we are dependent on a stable, liquid, and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments. our continued access to financial markets depends on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. if rating agencies lower our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances. each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically, and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same. in addition, we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk, principally interest rate fluctuations. disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could reduce our ability to fund our operations and capital investments, and lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures, which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we continue to make strategic investments to support our durable operating and financial model that further differentiates target and is designed to drive sustainable sales and profit growth. during 2021, in support of our enterprise strategy described in item 1 on page 2 of this form 10-k, we
•expanded our digital fulfillment capabilities, including adding permanent storage capacity in more than 200 high-volume stores, adding thousands of new items to the list available for order pickup and drive up, and doubling the number of drive up parking stalls compared with last year. during 2021, over 50 percent of our digital sales were fulfilled by our same-day fulfillment options: order pickup, drive up, and delivery via shipt.
•continued the steady stream of newness across our assortment and continued to introduce new owned brands, including our arts and crafts owned brand, mondo llamatm, our sweet and savory food brand, favorite daytm, our pet food brand, kindfulltm, and our first dedicated storage and home organization owned brand, brightroomtm. for the first time in history, 11 brands delivered $1 billion or more in sales, with 4 brands delivering over $2 billion in sales, driven by strength in apparel, home furnishings & decor and food & beverage.
•opened 32 new stores, including 28 additional small format stores in key urban markets and on college campuses.
•invested significantly in our team, including recognition bonuses and launch of a new debt-free education assistance program.
2021 included the following notable items:
◦comparable digitally originated sales increased 20.8 percent.
note: amounts may not foot due to rounding. adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (adjusted eps), a non-gaap metric, excludes the impact of certain items. management believes that adjusted eps is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures is provided on page 24.
we report after-tax return on invested capital (roic) from continuing operations because we believe roic provides a meaningful measure of our capital-allocation effectiveness over time. for the trailing twelve months ended january 29, 2022, after-tax roic was 33.1 percent, compared with 23.5 percent for the trailing twelve months ended january 30, 2021. the calculation of roic is provided on page 26.
the covid-19 pandemic continues to evolve. in 2020 and 2021, governments took various measures in response to covid-19, such as mandating the closure of certain businesses and encouraging or requiring citizens to avoid large gatherings. to date, virtually all of our stores, digital channels, and distribution centers have remained open.
since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, we have experienced strong comparable sales growth and significant volatility in our sales category and channel mix.
supply chain disruptions in recent months, we have seen increasing supply chain disruptions. in addition to country of origin production delays, trucker and dockworker shortages, a broad-based surge in consumer demand, and other factors have led to industry-wide u.s. port and ground transportation delays. in response, we have taken various actions, including ordering merchandise earlier, securing ocean freight routes, and increased use of air transport for certain merchandise. some of these supply chain disruptions and resulting actions have resulted in increased costs. the gross margin rate analysis on page 22 provides additional information.
a discussion regarding results of operations and analysis of financial condition for 2020, as compared to 2019, is included in part ii, item 7, md&a to our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended january 30, 2021.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis analysis of operations                       index to financial statements sales sales include all merchandise sales, net of expected returns, and our estimate of gift card breakage. note 4 to the financial statements defines gift card "breakage." we use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that have been closed, and digital acquisitions that we no longer operate. comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. as a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales, including shipment from stores to guests, store order pickup or drive up, and delivery via shipt. digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties.
sales growth - from both comparable sales and new stores - represents an important driver of our long-term profitability. we expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth. we believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests' shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price, convenience, guest experience, and other factors will over the long-term drive both increasing shopping frequency (number of transactions, or "traffic") and the amount spent each visit (average transaction amount).
digitally originated comparable sales change          20.8       144.7        28.6
digitally originated          18.9          17.9           8.8
note: sales fulfilled by stores include in-store purchases and digitally originated sales fulfilled by shipping merchandise from stores to guests, order pickup, drive up, and shipt.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis analysis of operations                       index to financial statements note 4 to the financial statements provides additional product category sales information. the collective interaction of a broad array of macroeconomic, competitive, and consumer behavioral factors, as well as sales mix, and transfer of sales to new stores makes further analysis of sales metrics infeasible.
td bank group offers credit to qualified guests through target-branded credit cards: the target credit card and the target mastercard credit card (target credit cards). additionally, we offer a branded proprietary target debit card. collectively, we refer to these products as redcardstm. we monitor the percentage of purchases that are paid for using redcards (redcard penetration) because our internal analysis has indicated that a meaningful portion of incremental purchases on our redcards are also incremental sales for target. guests receive a 5 percent discount on virtually all purchases when they use a redcard at target. redcard sales increased for all years presented below; however, redcard penetration declined as total sales increased at a faster pace.
target debit card                   11.7   %      12.3   %      12.6   %
target credit cards                  8.7           9.2          10.7
•supply chain pressure related to increased compensation and headcount in our distribution centers, partially offset by the small net benefit of a higher percentage of digital sales fulfilled through our lower-cost same-day fulfillment options
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense rate our sg&a expense rate was 18.6 percent in 2021, compared with 19.9 percent in 2020, reflecting the leverage benefit from strong revenue growth.
other performance factors net interest expense net interest expense was $421 million for 2021, compared with $977 million for 2020, which included a $512 million loss on early debt retirement.
provision for income taxes our 2021 effective income tax rate was 22.0 percent compared with 21.2 percent in 2020. the rate increase was driven by significantly higher pretax earnings, which diluted the tax-rate benefit of fixed and discrete tax items.
note 19 to the financial statements provides additional information.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures         index to financial statements reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to gaap measures to provide additional transparency, we have disclosed non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (adjusted eps). this metric excludes certain items presented below. we believe this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of our continuing operations. this measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (gaap). the most comparable gaap measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. adjusted eps should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with gaap. other companies may calculate adjusted eps differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.
(b)other items unrelated to current period operations, none of which were individually significant.
(c)represents benefits from the resolution of certain income tax matters unrelated to current period operations.

target corporation         2021 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis analysis of financial condition              index to financial statements analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources capital allocation we follow a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation based on the following priorities, ranked in order of importance: first, we fully invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business, create sustainable long-term value, and maintain our current operations and assets; second, we maintain a competitive quarterly dividend and seek to grow it annually; and finally, we return any excess cash to shareholders by repurchasing shares within the limits of our credit rating goals.
our year-end cash and cash equivalents balance decreased to $5.9 billion from $8.5 billion in 2020. our cash and cash equivalents balance includes short-term investments of $5.0 billion and $7.6 billion as of january 29, 2022, and january 30, 2021, respectively. our investment policy is designed to preserve principal and liquidity of our short-term investments. this policy allows investments in large money market funds or in highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less. we also place dollar limits on our investments in individual funds or instruments.
operating cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities were $8.6 billion in 2021 compared with $10.5 billion in 2020. for 2021, operating cash flows reflect stronger operating results, offset by increased inventory investment and lower accounts payable leverage, compared with 2020. additionally, operating cash flows for 2021 reflect a $1.0 billion increase in income tax payments.
inventory year-end inventory was $13.9 billion, compared with $10.7 billion in 2020. the increase in inventory levels reflect our efforts to align inventory with sales trends, and elevated in-transit inventory related to import supply chain delays.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis analysis of financial condition              index to financial statements capital expenditures note: amounts may not foot due to rounding.
capital expenditures increased in 2021 from the prior year as we invested in our strategic initiatives, including store remodels, some of which were delayed in 2020, new store openings, and supply chain projects. beyond full-store remodels, we invested in optimizing front-end space in high-volume locations to increase the efficiency of our same-day services, and built-out about 100 ulta beauty shop-in-shops. we have completed over 900 full-store remodels since the launch of the current program in 2017, including 145 in 2021.
in addition to these cash investments, we entered into leases related to new stores in 2021, 2020, and 2019 with total future minimum lease payments of $401 million, $764 million, and $669 million, respectively, and new leases related to our supply chain with total future minimum lease payments of $226 million, $442 million, and $185 million, respectively.
we expect capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion to support remodels, new stores, and supply chain projects. supply chain projects will add replenishment capacity and modernize our network, including the use of sortation centers to enhance our last-mile delivery capabilities. we expect to complete approximately 200 full-store remodels, open 25 to 30 new stores, and add more than 250 ulta beauty shop-in-shops during 2022. additionally, we will continue to invest in optimizing front-end space. we also expect to continue to invest in new store and supply chain leases.
dividends we paid dividends totaling $1.5 billion ($3.16 per share) in 2021 and $1.3 billion ($2.68 per share) in 2020, a per share increase of 17.9 percent. we declared dividends totaling $1.7 billion ($3.38 per share) in 2021 and $1.4 billion ($2.70 per share) in 2020, a per share increase of 25.2 percent. we have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.
share repurchases during 2021 and 2020 we returned $7.2 billion and $609 million, respectively, to shareholders through share repurchase. see part ii, item 5, market for the registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this annual report on form 10-k and note 21 to the financial statements for more information.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis analysis of financial condition              index to financial statements subsequent to year-end, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement to repurchase up to $2.75 billion of our common stock. under the agreement, we paid $2.75 billion and received an initial delivery of 8.9 million shares, subject to a final settlement of cash or additional shares in the second quarter of 2022.
financing our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets, to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities, and to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility. within these parameters, we seek to minimize our borrowing costs. our ability to access the long-term debt and commercial paper markets has provided us with ample sources of liquidity. our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and maintaining strong credit ratings. as of january 29, 2022, our credit ratings were as follows:
credit ratings          moody's        standard and poor's        fitch long-term debt          a2             a                          a commercial paper        p-1            a-1                        f1
if our credit ratings were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets, our cost of funds, and other terms for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. each of the credit rating agencies reviews its rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit ratings will remain the same as described above. fitch raised our long-term debt rating from a- to a during 2021.
in 2021, we issued $2.0 billion of debt, and we repaid $1.1 billion of debt at maturity.
in 2021, we obtained a committed $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in october 2026. this new facility replaced our $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire in october 2023. no balances were outstanding under either credit facility at any time during 2021 or 2020.
most of our long-term debt obligations contain covenants related to secured debt levels. in addition to a secured debt level covenant, our credit facility also contains a debt leverage covenant. we are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. additionally, as of january 29, 2022, no notes or debentures contained provisions requiring acceleration of payment upon a credit rating downgrade, except that certain outstanding notes allow the note holders to put the notes to us if within a matter of months of each other we experience both (i) a change in control and (ii) our long-term credit ratings are either reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade, or our long-term credit ratings are placed on watch for possible reduction and those ratings are subsequently reduced and the resulting rating is non-investment grade.
note 16 to the financial statements provides additional information.
future cash requirements we enter into contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business that may require future cash payments. such obligations include, but are not limited to, purchase commitments, debt service, leasing arrangements, and liabilities related to deferred compensation and pensions. the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information.
we believe our sources of liquidity, namely operating cash flows, credit facility capacity, and access to capital markets, will continue to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, working capital and capital expenditure requirements, finance anticipated expansion and strategic initiatives, fund debt maturities, pay dividends, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis analysis of financial condition              index to financial statements critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap, which requires us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts. in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. our management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit & risk committee of our board of directors. the following items require significant estimation or judgment:
inventory and cost of sales:    the vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (lifo). our inventory is valued at the lower of lifo cost or market. we reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality, among other factors. we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns in less than three months. inventory was $13.9 billion and $10.7 billion as of january 29, 2022, and january 30, 2021, respectively, and is further described in note 10 to the financial statements.
we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received. based on historical trending and data, this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. the majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. vendor income receivable was $518 million and $504 million as of january 29, 2022, and january 30, 2021, respectively. vendor income is described further in note 6 to the financial statements.
long-lived assets:    long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed primarily at the store level. an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value. we estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining valuations from third-party brokers, or using other valuation techniques. we recorded impairments of $87 million, $62 million, and $23 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, which are described further in note 12 to the financial statements.
insurance/self-insurance:    we retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. however, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. we use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. general liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $519 million and $510 million as of january 29, 2022, and january 30, 2021, respectively. we believe that the amounts accrued are appropriate; however, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. for example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $26 million in 2021. historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. refer to part ii, item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis analysis of financial condition &amp; new accounting pronouncements        index to financial statements income taxes:    we pay income taxes based on the tax statutes, regulations, and case law of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matters in dispute with tax authorities. the benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax positions would withstand challenge by taxing authorities. we periodically reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, were $138 million and $193 million as of january 29, 2022, and january 30, 2021, respectively. we believe the resolution of these matters will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements. income taxes are described further in note 19 to the financial statements.
pension accounting:    we maintain a funded qualified defined benefit pension plan, as well as nonqualified and international pension plans that are generally unfunded, for certain current and retired team members. the costs for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using the assumptions described in the following paragraphs. eligibility and the level of benefits vary depending on each team member's full-time or part-time status, date of hire, age, length of service, and/or compensation. the benefit obligation and related expense for these plans are determined based on actuarial calculations using assumptions about the expected long-term rate of return, the discount rate, compensation growth rates, mortality, and retirement age. these assumptions, with adjustments made for any significant plan or participant changes, are used to determine the period-end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year.
our 2021 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.80 percent was determined by the portfolio composition, historical long-term investment performance, and current market conditions. a 1 percentage point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase annual expense by $41 million.
the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long-term high-quality corporate bonds, using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. a 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by $62 million.
based on our experience, we use a graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger, shorter-service pension-eligible team members than it does for older, longer-service pension-eligible team members.
pension benefits are further described in note 24 to the financial statements.
legal and other contingencies:    we believe the accruals recorded in our consolidated financial statements properly reflect loss exposures that are both probable and reasonably estimable. we do not believe any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. however, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. if an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs, or future periods. refer to note 15 to the financial statements for further information on contingencies.
target corporation         2021 form 10-k management's discussion and analysis forward looking statements &amp; quantitative and qualitative disclosures        index to financial statements forward-looking statements this report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on our current assumptions and expectations. these statements are typically accompanied by the words "expect," "may," "could," "believe," "would," "might," "anticipates," or similar words. the principal forward-looking statements in this report include: our financial performance, statements regarding the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the funding of debt maturities, the continued execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments, the expected compliance with debt covenants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions regarding future dividends, contributions and payments related to our pension plan, the expected return on plan assets, the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the effects of macroeconomic conditions, the adequacy of our reserves for general liability, workers' compensation and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserves for claims, litigation, and the resolution of tax matters, our expectations regarding our contractual obligations, liabilities, and vendor income, the expected ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities and the timing of such recognition, the expected impact of changes in information technology systems, future responses to and effects of the covid-19 pandemic, and changes in our assumptions and expectations.
all such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. the most important factors which could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are set forth on our description of risk factors included in part i, item 1a, risk factors to this form 10-k, which should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements in this report. forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.

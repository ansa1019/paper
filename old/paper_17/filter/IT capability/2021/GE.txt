management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a). the consolidated financial statements of general electric company are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in u.s. dollars in millions. certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. discussions throughout this md&a are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. the md&a should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.
in the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. certain of these data are considered "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. see the non-gaap financial measures section for the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
changes in financial reporting. on november 1, 2021, we completed the combination of our ge capital aviation services (gecas) business with aercap holdings n.v. (aercap). upon completion of this transaction, in order to focus on our core industrial businesses of aviation, healthcare, renewable energy and power, we voluntarily transitioned from three-column to simpler one-column reporting for all periods presented.
previously, we presented our financial statements in a three-column format, which allowed investors to see our industrial operations separately from our financial services operations (ge capital). moving to one-column consolidated financial statements reflects the reduction in size of our financial services portfolio as a result of various strategic actions taken over recent years.
we also made these related reporting changes for all periods presented:
•began presenting the results of the remainder of our former capital segment, including energy financial services (efs) and our run-off insurance operations, within corporate;
•reclassified amounts related to our efs, working capital solutions (wcs) and treasury businesses from our formerly captioned ge capital revenues from services to other income to align with our industrial segment presentation of derivative, equity method and other investment income. there was no change to the presentation of our run-off insurance revenues and, consequently, our run-off insurance revenues are now presented as a separate line in our statement of earnings (loss);
•reclassified our formerly captioned financing receivables and other ge capital receivables to all other assets to further simplify our statement of financial position given the reduction of these balances over time in relation to consolidated total assets;
•ceased referring to ge industrial, a term formerly defined as the adding together of all industrial affiliates giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. therefore, all key performance indicators and non-gaap financial metrics previously identified as pertaining to ge industrial have been redefined to reflect total company results; and
•redefined the basis on which profit is determined for the remainder of our former capital segment which is now reported within corporate. previously, interest and other financial charges, income taxes, non-operating benefit costs and preferred stock dividends were included in determining our former capital segment profit (which we sometimes referred to as net earnings). to align with our industrial segments, these items are now excluded in determining profit for all businesses reported within corporate except efs, which will continue to be reported on a net earnings basis given the integral nature of production tax credits (ptcs) and investment tax credits (itcs) in relation to its business model.
2021 form 10-k in addition, effective december 31, 2021, we have changed the way we present sales of spare parts, upgrade equipment and other aftermarket goods that are used in the provision of our services in our statement of earnings (loss) to conform with the way we manage the businesses and have historically presented them in md&a and other related notes. specifically, we now consistently present sales of spare parts used in a service arrangement as part of sales of services and the related costs as costs of services sold. see note 1 for further information.
consolidated results significant developments. ge announced it plans to form three public companies focused on the growth sectors of aviation, healthcare and energy. in november 2021, we announced a strategic plan to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies from our (i) aviation business, (ii) healthcare business and (iii) renewable energy, power and digital businesses that we will combine. we intend to pursue a tax-free spin-off of healthcare in early 2023, creating a pure play company at the center of precision health, and we expect to retain a stake of 19.9% in the new company. we intend to pursue a tax-free spin-off of the combined renewable energy, power and digital businesses in early 2024, and that new company will be positioned to lead the energy transition. following these transactions, ge will be an aviation-focused company, shaping the future of flight. as independently run companies, each can benefit from greater focus, tailored capital allocation, and strategic flexibility to deliver long-term growth and create value for customers, investors and employees. the respective capital structures, brands and leadership teams for each independent company will be determined and announced later.
coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has impacted global economies, resulting in workforce and travel restrictions, supply chain and production disruptions and reduced demand and spending across many sectors. since the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, these factors have had a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. while factors related directly and indirectly to the covid-19 pandemic have been impacting operations and financial performance at varying levels across all our businesses, the most significant impact to date has been at our aviation segment. for details about impacts related to our businesses and actions we have taken in response, as applicable, refer to the respective segment sections within md&a. we anticipate that our operations and financial performance will continue to be impacted by the covid-19 pandemic in future periods. these impacts will ultimately depend on many factors that are not within our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; the emergence of covid-19 virus variants; and the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines.
gecas. on november 1, 2021, we completed the combination of our gecas business with aercap and received $22.6 billion in cash, subject to future closing adjustments, 111.5 million shares of aercap common stock (approximately 46% ownership interest) valued at approximately $6.6 billion based on aercap's closing share price on october 29, 2021, and a $1.0 billion aercap senior note. in connection with the closing of the transaction, the company recorded a non-cash after-tax charge of $3.9 billion in discontinued operations in 2021, including a loss of $0.2 billion in the fourth quarter. additionally, we have elected to prospectively measure our investment in aercap at fair value and expect to have continuing involvement with aercap, primarily through our ownership interest and ongoing sales or leases of products and services. we expect to fully monetize our stake in aercap over time. see notes 2 and 3 for further information.
liability management actions. during 2021, we completed debt tenders to repurchase a total of $32.6 billion of debt, comprising $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. the total after-tax loss on these actions was $6.1 billion ($6.5 billion pre-tax), comprising an after-tax loss of $1.1 billion ($1.4 billion pre-tax) in the second quarter of 2021 and an after-tax loss of $5.0 billion ($5.1 billion pre-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2021. the majority of the loss relates to the present value of accelerating future interest payments associated with the debt. as a result of these actions, we expect lower interest expense going forward.
factoring. effective april 1, 2021, we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we subsequently discontinued our remaining unconsolidated receivables facility. for the nine months ended december 31, 2021, the adverse impact to ge businesses' cash flows from operating activities (cfoa) was $5.1 billion, including $1.6 billion related to the unconsolidated receivables facility in the fourth quarter, which primarily represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the period had customer receivables not been previously sold and is excluded from free cash flows*. the adverse cfoa impact associated with activity in factoring programs that have now been discontinued was $5.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021.
reverse stock split. in the second quarter of 2021, we announced that we would proceed with the 1-for-8 reverse stock split, as approved by shareholders, and filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effectuate the reverse stock split after the close of trading on july 30, 2021. ge common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on august 2, 2021. our shares of outstanding common stock and earnings per share calculation have been retroactively restated for all periods presented.
bk medical. in the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired bk medical, a leader in surgical ultrasound imaging and guidance, from altaris capital partners for a cash purchase price of $1.5 billion.
*non-gaap financial measure
2021 form 10-k summary of 2021 results. total revenues were $74.2 billion, down $1.6 billion for the year, driven primarily by decreases at aviation, power and healthcare.
continuing earnings (loss) per share was $(3.25). excluding debt extinguishment costs, gains (losses) on equity securities, non-operating benefit costs, earnings from our run-off insurance business and restructuring and other charges, adjusted earnings per share* was $1.71. for the year ended december 31, 2021, profit (loss) was $(3.7) billion and profit margins were (5.0)%, down $9.7 billion, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of the prior year gain on the sale of our biopharma business of $12.4 billion and higher debt extinguishment costs of $6.2 billion, partially offset by a higher net gain on equity securities of $3.8 billion, higher segment profit of $1.9 billion, the nonrecurrence of goodwill impairments of $0.9 billion, a decrease in non-operating benefit costs of $0.6 billion, a decrease in adjusted corporate operating costs* of $0.4 billion, higher profit on our run-off insurance business of $0.4 billion, the nonrecurrence of steam asset impairments in the prior year of $0.4 billion, lower interest and other financial charges of $0.2 billion, and the nonrecurrence of the legal reserves associated with the sec investigation in the prior year of $0.2 billion. adjusted organic profit* increased $2.7 billion, driven primarily by increases at aviation, power and healthcare. additionally, we continue to experience inflation pressure in our supply chain as well as delays in sourcing key materials needed for our products. the most significant impact to date has been at our healthcare segment, which has delayed our ability to convert remaining performance obligation (rpo) to revenue. while we are taking actions to limit this pressure, we may experience a greater impact on our longer cycle businesses in future periods.
cash flows from operating activities were $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. cfoa decreased primarily due to an increase in cash collateral paid net of settlements on derivative contracts and an increase in cash used for working capital, partially offset by lower ge pension plan contributions (which are excluded from free cash flows (fcf)*) and an increase in net income (after adjusting for the gain on the sale of biopharma, non-cash gains/losses related to our interest in baker hughes, non-operating benefit costs and non-operating debt extinguishment costs). fcf* were $1.9 billion and $0.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. fcf* increased primarily due to an increase in net income (after adjusting for the gain on the sale of biopharma, non-cash gains/losses related to our interest in baker hughes, non-operating benefit costs and non-operating debt extinguishment costs) and an increase in cash from working capital (after adjusting for the impact from discontinued factoring programs and eliminations related to our receivables factoring and supply chain finance programs), partially offset by an increase in cash collateral paid net of settlements on derivative contracts. we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs in 2021. in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, the adverse impact to cfoa was $5.1 billion, which primarily represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the period had customer receivables not been previously sold and is excluded from fcf*. see the capital resources and liquidity - statement of cash flows section for further information.
rpo is unfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product services) excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty. in the second quarter of 2021, we voluntarily replaced our quarterly disclosures of backlog with rpo as a key metric, one commonly used across our industries, in order to simplify our reporting and align with our peers. see note 23 for further information.
(a) rpo as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020 excludes the biopharma business due to its disposition in the first quarter of 2020. rpo as of december 31, 2019 included $1,227 million related to biopharma.
as of december 31, 2021, rpo increased $9.2 billion (4%) from december 31, 2020, primarily at aviation, from engines contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service; at healthcare, from new contracts and renewals with large customers as well as supply chain challenges in converting rpo to revenue; and at renewable energy, primarily at offshore wind; partially offset by a decrease at power from sales outpacing new orders in gas power and the continued wind down of the steam power new build coal business.
as of december 31, 2020, rpo decreased $14.8 billion (6%) from december 31, 2019 primarily driven by aviation due to a reduction in commercial services. the reduction in commercial services reflects lower anticipated engine utilization, the cancellation of equipment unit orders, customer fleet restructuring and contract modifications. power decreased due to sales outpacing new orders; healthcare decreased with the disposition of the biopharma business of $1.2 billion; and renewable energy increased due to new orders outpacing sales.
*non-gaap financial measure
2021 form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, total revenues decreased $1.6 billion (2%). equipment revenues decreased primarily at power, due to decreased gas power equipment revenues on lower turnkey sales and steam power equipment on the exit of new build coal; at aviation, due to fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments; and at healthcare, due to the disposition of the biopharma business; partially offset by an increase at renewable energy driven by higher revenue at offshore wind. services revenues increased primarily at power, due to an increase in gas power and steam power services revenues; at healthcare, due to increased volume in imaging and ultrasound and a return to pre-pandemic volume in pharmaceutical diagnostics; and at aviation, primarily due to increased shop visit volume; partially offset by a decrease at renewable energy, primarily due to lower repower unit deliveries at onshore wind. insurance revenues increased $0.2 billion (8)%. the decrease in revenues included the net effects of acquisitions of $0.1 billion, the net effects of dispositions of $1.5 billion and the effects of a stronger u.s. dollar of $1.0 billion. excluding insurance revenues and the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency, organic revenues* decreased $1.5 billion (2%), with equipment revenues down $3.0 billion (8%) and services revenues up $1.5 billion (4%). organic revenues* decreased at aviation, power and renewable energy, partially offset by an increase at healthcare.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, total revenues decreased $14.4 billion (16%). the decrease in services revenues was primarily at aviation, driven by lower commercial spare part shipments, decreased shop visits and the cumulative impact of changes in billing and cost assumptions in our long-term service agreements; and at power, due to declines in transactional part sales and upgrades at gas power. the decrease in equipment revenues was primarily at aviation, due to fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments; and at healthcare, due to the disposition of the biopharma business; partially offset by increases at renewable energy, primarily from onshore wind with more wind turbine shipments than in the prior year, and offshore wind; and at gas power, due to an increase in heavy-duty gas turbine unit shipments. insurance revenues increased $0.1 billion (2%). the decrease in revenues included the net effects of acquisitions of $0.1 billion, the net effects of dispositions of $3.6 billion and the effects of a weaker u.s. dollar of $0.3 billion. excluding insurance revenues and the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency, organic revenues* decreased $10.7 billion (13%), with a decrease in services revenues of $8.8 billion (20%) and a decrease in equipment revenues of $1.9 billion (5%). organic revenues* decreased at aviation and power, partially offset by increases at healthcare and renewable energy.
for the year ended december 31, 2021, continuing earnings decreased $9.7 billion primarily due to the nonrecurrence of the prior year gain on the sale of our biopharma business of $12.4 billion and higher debt extinguishment costs of $6.2 billion, partially offset by a higher net gain on equity securities of $3.8 billion, higher segment profit of $1.9 billion, the nonrecurrence of goodwill impairments of $0.9 billion, a decrease in non-operating benefit costs of $0.6 billion, a decrease in adjusted corporate operating costs* of $0.4 billion, higher profit at our run-off insurance business of $0.4 billion, the nonrecurrence of steam asset impairments in the prior year of $0.4 billion, lower interest and other financial charges of $0.2 billion and the nonrecurrence of the legal reserves associated with the sec investigation in the prior year of $0.2 billion. adjusted earnings* was $1.9 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion. profit margin was (5.0)%, a decrease from 7.9%, primarily due to the same net decreases as described above. adjusted profit* was $4.6 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion organically*, due to increases at aviation, power and healthcare. adjusted profit margin* was 6.5%, an increase of 400 basis points organically*.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, continuing earnings increased $7.2 billion, driven primarily by the gain on the sale of our biopharma business of $12.4 billion, the nonrecurrence of a $1.0 billion pre-tax charge identified through the completion of our 2019 annual insurance premium deficiency review, lower provision for income taxes of $1.1 billion, lower interest and other financial charges of $0.8 billion, decreased goodwill impairments of $0.6 billion and decreased non-operating benefit costs of $0.4 billion; partially offset by decreased segment profit of $6.2 billion, an increase of $2.8 billion in losses on our investment in baker hughes and the legal reserves associated with the sec investigation of $0.2 billion. adjusted earnings* was $(0.1) billion, a decrease of $4.3 billion. profit margin was 7.9%, an increase of 800 basis points, primarily due to the same net increases as described above. adjusted profit* was $2.2 billion, a decrease of $5.1 billion organically*, primarily due to a decrease at aviation, partially offset by an increase at healthcare. adjusted profit margin* was 3.1%, a decrease of 570 basis points organically*.
segment operations. segment revenues include sales of equipment and services by our segments. segment profit is determined based on performance measures used by our chief operating decision maker (codm), who is our chief executive officer (ceo), to assess the performance of each business in a given period. in connection with that assessment, the ceo may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions, and certain litigation settlements. see the corporate section for further information about costs excluded from segment profit.
segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries.

commercial engines and services - manufactures jet engines for commercial airframes. our commercial engines power aircraft in all categories: regional, narrowbody and widebody. this includes engines and components for business aviation and aeroderivative applications as well. we also produce and market engines and aftermarket services through joint ventures with safran group of france (safran) and raytheon technologies corporation via their pratt & whitney segment. commercial provides maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (mro), including sales of replacement parts.
military - manufactures jet engines for military airframes. our military engines power a wide variety of military aircraft including fighters, bombers, tankers, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as marine applications. we provide maintenance, component repair and overhaul services, including sales of replacement parts.
systems & other - provides avionics systems, aviation electric power systems, turboprop engines, engine gear and transmission components and services for commercial and military segments. additionally, we provide a wide variety of products and services including additive machines, additive materials (including metal powders), and additive engineering services.
competition & regulation. the global businesses for aircraft jet engines, maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (including parts sales) are highly competitive. both domestic and international markets are important to the growth and success of the business. product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. research and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies. in addition, we are subject to market and regulatory dynamics related to decarbonization which will require a combination of technological innovation in the fuel efficiency of engines, expanding the use of sustainable aviation fuels and the development of electric flight and hydrogen-based aviation technologies. aircraft engine and systems orders tend to follow civil air travel demand and military procurement cycles.
our products, services and activities are subject to a number of global regulators such as the u.s. federal aviation administration (faa), european union aviation safety agency (easa), civil aviation administration of china (caac) and other regulatory bodies.
2021 form 10-k significant trends & developments. the global covid-19 pandemic continues to have a material adverse effect on the global airline industry, although aviation's results in 2021 reflect improvement in market fundamentals. a key underlying driver of aviation's commercial engine and services business is global commercial air traffic, which in turn is driven by economic activity and consumer and business propensity to travel. since the beginning of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, we have seen varied levels of recovery in global markets. government travel restrictions, public health advisories, individuals' propensity to travel and continued cases of the virus have all impacted the level of air travel. aviation regularly tracks global departures, which for 2021, were approximately 30% below 2019. global departures improved during 2021, up approximately 20% compared to 2020, but levels of recovery varied across regions due in large part to the emergence of covid-19 virus variants. aviation remains confident in the recovery, while actively monitoring the impact of travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, and economic and industry forecasts. we are in frequent dialogue with our airline and airframe customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, fleet retirements, and after-market services, including shop visit and spare parts demand. given current trends, we expect domestic travel routes primarily served by narrowbody aircraft to recover before long-haul, international travel routes, which are primarily served by widebody aircraft. consistent with industry projections, aviation continues to estimate the duration of the market recovery to be prolonged over the next couple of years, dependent on containing the spread of the virus, effective inoculation programs and government collaboration to encourage travel, particularly around reducing quarantine requirements.
aviation has taken several actions to respond to the current adverse environment and is actively monitoring the pace of demand recovery to ensure the business is appropriately sized for the future. in addition, we continue to partner with our airline and leasing customers and collaborate with our airframe partners on production rates for 2022 and beyond.
as it relates to the military environment, aviation continues to forecast strong military demand creating future growth opportunities for our military business unit as the u.s. department of defense and foreign governments have continued flight operations, and have allocated budgets to upgrade and modernize their existing fleets. during 2021, aviation experienced supply chain challenges impacting the delivery of military engines, which the business is actively addressing.
total engineering, comprising company, customer and partner-funded and nonrecurring engineering costs, decreased compared to prior year in line with the changes in the commercial environment and due to the timing of planned program expenditures. aviation continues to be committed to investment in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight. in june 2021, aviation and safran announced revolutionary innovation for sustainable engines (rise), a technology development program targeting more than 20% lower fuel consumption and co2 emissions compared to today's engines. in september 2021, aviation's catalyst engine, the first clean-sheet turboprop design entering the business and general aviation market in 50 years, completed its first flight.
aviation is taking actions to protect its ability to serve its customers now and as the global airline industry recovers. aviation's deep history of innovation and technology leadership, commercial engine installed base of approximately 39,400 units, with approximately 10,800 units under long-term service agreements, and military engine installed base of approximately 26,200 units represents strong long-term fundamentals. aviation expects to emerge from the covid-19 pandemic well-positioned to drive long-term profitable growth and cash generation over time.

2021 form 10-k competition & regulation. while many factors, including government incentives and specific market rules, affect how renewable energy can deliver outcomes for customers in a given region, renewable energy has become competitive with fossil fuels in terms of levelized cost of electricity. we continue to invest in generating wind turbine product improvements, including larger rotors, taller towers and higher nameplate ratings that continue to drive down the cost of onshore and offshore wind energy, to develop more efficient production processes for key components and to explore ways to further improve the efficiency and flexibility of our hydropower technology with new innovative turbine designs and digital solutions. as industry models continue to evolve, our digital strategy and investments in technical innovation will position us to add value for customers looking for clean, renewable energy.
significant trends & developments. while we continue to expect long term growth in u.s onshore wind, the expiry of u.s. production tax credits (ptc) in 2021 has created uncertainty resulting in project delays and deferral of customer investments. we are monitoring policy proposals where a strong and diverse interest in tax credits promoting new wind generation continues to exist. the latest wood mackenzie equipment and repower forecast expects u.s onshore wind to decline from 15 gigawatts of new installations in 2021 to approximately 10 gigawatts in 2022. despite the market uncertainty, we have maintained our leading position in the u.s. the offshore wind industry continues to experience strong global market momentum and we have received customer commitments for the haliade-x spanning across europe, north america and asia. customer preference continues to shift to larger, more efficient units to drive down costs and compete with other power generation options. the grid and hydro business units are executing their turnaround plans that include increased project selectivity discipline, cost reduction and investment in more profitable segments. we are monitoring the impact across our industries from rising inflationary costs of transportation and commodities, broader supply chain and permitting process challenges across the onshore and offshore wind industry.
new product introductions remain important to our onshore and offshore customers who are demonstrating the willingness to adopt the new technology of larger turbines that decrease the levelized cost of energy. we have observed significant market demand for our 5-6 mw cypress and 3-4 mw sierra onshore units and our 12-14 mw haliade-x offshore units. our haliade-x prototype unit is currently operating at 14mw. preparing for large scale production, while reducing the cost of these new product platforms and blade technologies remains a key priority. at grid solutions, new technology such as flexible transformers and g3 switchgears are solving for a more resilient and efficient electric grid and lower greenhouse gas emissions, respectively.

rpo as of december 31, 2021 increased $0.7 billion (2%) from december 31, 2020 primarily driven by the offshore vineyard wind (u.s) and dogger bank (u.k.) wind farms and from higher onshore wind services, partially offset by equipment sales exceeding new orders at onshore and grid and the impact from a stronger u.s. dollar. the decrease at onshore wind is largely driven by ptc uncertainty delaying investment in north america, while at grid is primarily due to increased commercial selectivity in certain product lines.
revenues decreased $0.4 billion (2%) organically*, primarily from lower revenue at grid due to increased commercial selectivity and fewer wind turbine and repower deliveries at onshore wind, partially offset by higher revenue at offshore wind's legacy edf project.
segment losses increased 6% organically*, primarily from lower repower volume at onshore wind, lower volume at grid and lower margins on new product introductions at onshore wind, partially offset by the favorable impact of cost reduction actions and lower project related charges.

2021 form 10-k power. power serves power generation, industrial, government and other customers worldwide with products and services related to energy production. our products and technologies harness resources such as oil, gas, fossil, diesel and nuclear to produce electric power and include gas and steam turbines, full balance of plant, upgrade and service solutions, as well as data-leveraging software. we have organized the businesses within our power segment into gas power, steam, power conversion and nuclear and other.
gas power - offers a wide spectrum of heavy-duty and aeroderivative gas turbines for utilities, independent power producers and numerous industrial applications, ranging from small, mobile power to utility scale power plants. gas power also delivers maintenance and service solutions across total plant assets and over their operational lifecycle.
steam power - offers a broad portfolio of technologies and services predominately for nuclear and fossil power plants to help customers deliver reliable power as they transition to a lower carbon future.
power conversion, nuclear and other - applies the science and systems of power conversion to provide motors, generators, automation and control equipment and drives for energy intensive industries such as marine, oil and gas, mining, rail, metals and test systems. through joint ventures with hitachi, it also provides nuclear technology solutions for boiling water reactors including reactor design, reactor fuel and support services.
competition & regulation. worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. demand for power generation is global, and as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environments of each country in which we do business. our products and services sold to end customers are often subject to many regulatory requirements and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy industry standards. in addition, we are subject to market and other dynamics related to decarbonization, where it will remain important to lower greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come, which will likely depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today, but may become more important over time (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies or small modular or other advanced nuclear power).
significant trends & developments. power continues to streamline its business to better align with market demand and drive its business units with an operational rigor and discipline that is focused on its customers' lifecycle experience. we remain focused on our underwriting discipline, commercial selectivity and risk management to ensure we are securing deals that meet our financial hurdles and we have a high confidence to deliver for our customers.
during the current period, global gas generation was down low-single-digits due to higher gas prices. however, ge gas turbine utilization continues to be resilient as megawatt hours grew high-single-digits from incremental ha gas turbine units coming online running baseload power. looking ahead, we anticipate the power market to continue to be impacted by overcapacity in the industry, continued price pressure from competition on servicing the installed base, and the uncertain timing of deal closures due to financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets, as well as the ongoing impacts of covid-19. although market factors related to the energy transition such as greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related policies continue to impact long-term demand (and related financing), to differing degrees across markets globally, we expect the gas market to remain stable through the next decade with gas generation continuing to grow low-single-digits. we believe gas will play a critical role in the energy transition and are encouraged by the growth in gas power services.
as separately announced on february 10, 2022, we signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for ge steam power to sell a portion of its business to électricité de france s.a. (edf), which will result in a reclassification of that business to held for sale in the first quarter of 2022. a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge will be taken related to the remaining business intangible and fixed assets of approximately $0.7 to $0.8 billion. the sale transaction is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2023, subject to completion of the parties' respective information and consultation processes and satisfaction of certain conditions, and closing the transaction is expected to result in a significant gain.
we continue to invest in new product development, such as our ha-turbines and nuclear small modular reactors. our fundamentals remain strong with approximately $68.7 billion in rpo and a gas turbine installed base greater than 7,000 units, including approximately 1,800 units under long-term service agreements.

rpo as of december 31, 2021 decreased $4.6 billion (6%) from december 31, 2020, primarily driven by the continued wind down of the steam power new build coal business, sales outpacing new orders in gas power contractual services, and a significant gas power equipment order from the prior year that did not repeat.
revenues decreased $0.7 billion (4%) organically*, primarily due to decreased gas power equipment revenues on lower turnkey sales and steam power equipment on the exit of new build coal, partially offset by an increase in gas power and steam power services revenues.
profit increased $0.5 billion organically* due to increases in gas power services revenues and margins, predominately in the long-term services portfolio, and aeroderivative sales and continued efforts to streamline the businesses, partially offset by decreases due to gas power and steam power equipment revenues and contract and legal charges.

2021 form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, revenues remained relatively flat primarily as the result of $0.3 billion lower revenue due to the sale of our lighting business in june 2020 offset by $0.2 billion of higher revenue primarily as the result of strong investment results in our run-off insurance business and $0.2 billion of lower intersegment eliminations. corporate operating profit decreased by $6.3 billion due to $12.5 billion of lower gains on purchases and sales of business interests primarily due to a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of our biopharma business in 2020. this decrease was partially offset by a $3.8 billion change in gains (losses) on equity securities primarily related to $2.9 billion and $0.7 billion of mark-to-market activity on our baker hughes and aercap shares respectively. in addition, corporate operating profit increased due to lower restructuring and other charges primarily at aviation and corporate, partially offset by power, and nonrecurrence of non-cash impairment charges and settlement of the sec investigation in 2020, and higher income in our run-off insurance business primarily driven by strong investment results and lower claims.
adjusted total corporate operating costs* decreased by $0.4 billion primarily as the result of $0.5 billion of cost reductions in our corporate functions. in addition, corporate cost decreased by $0.2 billion as the result of lower intercompany elimination activity from project financing investments associated with wind energy projects in our renewable energy segment, lower intersegment eliminations, partially offset by higher spare engine sales from our aviation segment to our gecas business before its combination with aercap in november 2021. these decreases were partially offset by $0.2 billion of higher costs associated with ehs and other items.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, revenues decreased by $0.9 billion, primarily as a result of a $0.5 billion decrease in revenues due to the sale of our current and lighting businesses in april 2019 and june 2020, respectively, $0.5 billion of higher inter-segment eliminations, partially offset by $0.1 billion of higher revenue in our run-off insurance business. corporate operating profit increased by $11.2 billion due to $12.6 billion of higher gains on purchases and sales of business interests primarily due to a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of our biopharma business in 2020, partially offset by a $2.8 billion change in gains (losses) on equity securities primarily related to mark-to-market activity on our baker hughes shares. corporate operating profit also increased due to lower restructuring and other charges, primarily at corporate and power, partially offset by higher charges at aviation, lower non-cash impairment charges, partially offset by $0.2 billion for the settlement of the sec investigation in 2020. in addition, corporate profit increased by $1.0 billion due to the nonrecurrence of $1.0 billion pre-tax charge identified through our annual insurance premium deficiency review in our run-off insurance business in 2019.
adjusted total corporate operating costs* remained relatively flat in 2020 due to $0.2 billion of lower ehs and other items, $0.3 billion of cost reductions in our digital business and corporate functions, offset by $0.4 billion of higher costs in our ge capital businesses primarily due to lower gains from the sale of equity method investments at efs, higher marks and volume decline. overall, eliminations were relatively flat due to higher intercompany elimination activity from project financing investments associated with wind energy projects in our renewable energy segment, higher intersegment eliminations, offset by lower spare engine sales from our aviation segment to our previously owned gecas business.

liabilities associated with restructuring activities were approximately $1.0 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.7 billion including actuarial determined post-employment severance benefits of $0.5 billion, $0.7 billion, and $1.0 billion as of december 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
*non-gaap financial measure
2021 form 10-k interest and other financial charges were $1.9 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the decreases for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to lower average borrowings balances, partially offset by a lower allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations. inclusive of interest expense in discontinued operations, total interest and other financial charges were $2.5 billion, $3.0 billion and $4.2 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the decreases for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 were driven primarily by lower average borrowings balances. the primary components of interest and other financial charges are interest on short- and long-term borrowings. see note 10 for further information about average interest rates on borrowings.
debt extinguishment costs were $6.5 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. during 2021, we executed debt tenders in the second and fourth quarters and incurred debt extinguishment costs of $1.4 billion in the second quarter and $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter. the majority of these costs relate to the present value of accelerating future interest payments associated with the debt. as a result of these actions, we expect lower interest expense going forward.

provision (benefit) for income taxes            $(286)          $(487)              $552
for the year ended december 31, 2021, the consolidated income tax rate was 7.8% compared to (8.2)% for the year ended december 31, 2020. the tax rate for 2021 reflects a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss. the negative tax rate for 2020 reflects a tax benefit on pre-tax income.
the consolidated benefit for income taxes was $(0.3) billion and $(0.5) billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the benefit decreased due to tax associated with the increase in pre-tax income excluding the gain from the sale of our biopharma business and debt extinguishment costs ($2.0 billion) and from the nonrecurrence of the tax benefit recognized in 2020 for the completion of the internal revenue service (irs) audit for 2014-2015 ($0.1 billion). the increase in pre-tax income includes realized and unrealized gain on our remaining interest in baker hughes in 2021, compared to realized and unrealized loss in 2020. partially offsetting these items was the nonrecurrence of the tax expense in 2020 associated with the disposition of the biopharma business ($1.1 billion), the tax benefit on the debt extinguishment costs ($0.4 billion) as well as tax benefits associated with internal restructurings to recognize deductible stock and loan losses ($0.4 billion).
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the consolidated income tax benefit was $0.5 billion. the change in tax from a tax provision of $0.6 billion in 2019 to a tax benefit for 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income excluding the gain from the sale of our biopharma business and non-deductible goodwill impairment charges ($1.5 billion) and a decrease in valuation allowances on non-u.s. deferred tax assets ($0.2 billion) partially offset by the increase in tax expense associated with the disposition of the biopharma business in 2020 compared to the amount recognized on preparatory steps for the planned disposition in 2019 ($0.5 billion) and a decrease in benefit from the completion of irs audits ($0.2 billion).
absent additional taxes enacted as part of u.s. tax reform and non-u.s. losses without a tax benefit, our consolidated income tax provision is generally reduced because of the benefits of lower-taxed global operations as certain non-u.s. income is subject to local country tax rates that are below the u.s. statutory tax rate.
the rate of tax on our profitable non-u.s. earnings is below the u.s. statutory tax rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate and because ge funds certain non-u.s. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations and as of december 31, 2021, we have not decided to repatriate these earnings to the u.s. given u.s. tax reform, substantially all of our net prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. tax and accordingly we generally expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-u.s. cash without additional u.s. federal tax cost and any foreign withholding taxes on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit. in december 2021, the company announced plans to form three public companies focused on aviation, healthcare and energy. planning for and execution of this separation will result in tax including potentially tax on changes in indefinite reinvestment outside the u.s. the impact of a change in reinvestment will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.
a substantial portion of the benefit for lower-taxed non-u.s. earnings related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate is derived from our aviation operations located in singapore where the earnings are primarily taxed at a rate of 8% and our power operations located in switzerland where the earnings are taxed at between 9% and 18.6%.
2021 form 10-k the rate of tax on non-u.s. operations is increased, however, because we also incur losses in foreign jurisdictions where it is not likely that the losses can be utilized and no tax benefit is provided for those losses and valuation allowances against loss carryforwards are provided when it is no longer likely that the losses can be utilized. non-u.s. losses also limit our ability to claim u.s. foreign tax credits on certain operations, further increasing the rate of tax on non-u.s. operations. in addition, as part of u.s. tax reform, the u.s. has enacted a tax on "base eroding" payments from the u.s. we have taken restructuring actions to mitigate the impact from this provision. the u.s. has also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low tax income). because we have tangible assets outside the u.s. and pay significant foreign taxes, we generally do not expect a significant increase in tax liability from this new u.s. minimum tax. overall, these newly enacted provisions increase the rate of tax on our non-u.s. operations.

for the year ended december 31, 2021, the change from a benefit from global operations in 2020 to an expense from global operations in 2021 reflects lower benefits associated with legacy financial services operations.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the change from an expense from global operations in 2019 to a benefit from global operations in 2020 primarily reflects decrease in valuation allowances on non-u.s. deferred tax assets.
a more detailed analysis of differences between the u.s. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective rate, as well as other information about our income tax provisions, is provided in the critical accounting estimates section and note 14.
research and development. we conduct research and development (r&d) activities to continually enhance our existing products and services, develop new products and services to meet our customers' changing needs and requirements, and address new market opportunities. in addition to funding r&d internally, we also receive funding externally from our customers and partners, which contributes to the overall r&d for the company.

(b) customer funded is principally u.s. government funded in our aviation segment.
discontinued operations primarily comprise our ge capital aviation services (gecas) business, discontinued in 2021, our mortgage portfolio in poland, and other trailing assets and liabilities associated with prior dispositions. results of operations, financial position and cash flows for these businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented and the notes to the financial statements have been adjusted on a retrospective basis. see notes 2 and 22 for further information regarding our businesses in discontinued operations.
capital resources and liquidity financial policy. we intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy with a sustainable investment-grade long-term credit rating. in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company announced plans to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade companies, each of which will determine their own financial policies, including capital allocation, dividend, mergers and acquisitions and buy back decisions.
liquidity policy. we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to meet our business needs and financial obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. we believe that our consolidated liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.
consolidated liquidity. our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows* from our operating businesses, cash generated from asset sales and dispositions, and short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities. cash generation can be subject to variability based on many factors, including seasonality, receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term contracts, market conditions and our ability to execute dispositions. total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $15.8 billion at december 31, 2021, of which $6.4 billion was held in the u.s. and $9.4 billion was held outside the u.s.
*non-gaap financial measure
2021 form 10-k cash held in non-u.s. entities has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding amounts held in countries with currency controls) without additional federal tax cost. any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit. with regards to our announcement to form three public companies, we expect that planning for and execution of this separation will impact indefinite reinvestment. the impact of that change will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.
cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at december 31, 2021 included $2.0 billion of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions and $0.3 billion of restricted use cash. cash held in countries with currency controls represents amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the u.s. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the u.s. without incurring substantial costs. restricted use cash represents amounts that are not available to fund operations, and primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters. excluded from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $0.4 billion of cash in our run-off insurance business, which was classified as all other assets in the statement of financial position.
in connection with the program we launched in 2020 to fully monetize our baker hughes position over approximately three years, we received total proceeds of $4.1 billion in 2021, including $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. in addition, we received $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022. in addition, we expect to fully monetize our stake in aercap over time.
we provided capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion in the first quarters of 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and expect to provide further capital contributions of approximately $5.5 billion through 2024, including approximately $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our december 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. these contributions are subject to ongoing monitoring by the kansas insurance department (kid), and the total amount to be contributed could increase or decrease, or the timing could be accelerated, based upon the results of reserve adequacy testing or a decision by kid to modify the schedule of contributions set forth in january 2018. we are required to maintain specified capital levels at these insurance subsidiaries under capital maintenance agreements.
borrowings. consolidated total borrowings were $35.2 billion and $74.9 billion at december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, respectively, a decrease of $39.7 billion. the reduction in borrowings was driven by debt repurchases of $32.6 billion, net repayments and maturities of debt of $4.6 billion, $1.7 billion of fair value adjustments for debt in fair value hedge relationships, and $0.8 billion related to changes in foreign exchange rates and other amortization.
we have in place committed revolving credit facilities totaling $14.4 billion at december 31, 2021, comprised of a $10.0 billion unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and a total of $4.4 billion of bilateral revolving credit facilities.
liability management actions. during 2021, we completed debt tenders to repurchase a total of $32.6 billion of debt, comprising $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. see note 10 for further information.
credit ratings and conditions. we have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations. the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. moody's investors service (moody's), standard and poor's global ratings (s&p), and fitch ratings (fitch) currently issue ratings on our short- and long-term debt. as a result of our transition to one-column financial statement reporting in the fourth quarter of 2021, we are now presenting our credit ratings on a consolidated basis for the company. our credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the table below.
moody's        s&amp;p                    fitch outlook           negative       creditwatch negative       stable short term        p-2            a-2                        f3
long term         baa1           bbb+                       bbb in the fourth quarter of 2021, upon the completion of the gecas transaction, moody's and fitch affirmed our credit rating and outlook, and s&p resolved our creditwatch designation with no change to our rating. upon our subsequent announcement to form three independent companies, moody's and fitch affirmed their respective credit ratings and outlooks, and s&p placed us on creditwatch with negative implications.
we are disclosing our credit ratings and any current quarter updates to these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds and access to liquidity. our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. for a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings, see the financial risks section of risk factors in this report.
substantially all of the company's debt agreements in place at december 31, 2021 do not contain material credit rating covenants. our unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and certain of our bilateral revolving credit facilities contain a customary net debt-to-ebitda financial covenant, which we satisfied at december 31, 2021.
the company may from time to time enter into agreements that contain minimum ratings requirements. the following table provides a summary of the maximum estimated liquidity impact in the event of further downgrades below each stated ratings level.
2021 form 10-k triggers below           at december 31, 2021
our most significant contractual ratings requirements are related to ordinary course commercial activities. the timing within the quarter of the potential liquidity impact of these areas may differ, as can the remedies to resolving any potential breaches of required ratings levels.
foreign exchange and interest rate risks. as a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. such principal currencies include the euro, the chinese renminbi, the indian rupee and japanese yen, among others. the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings, excluding the earnings impact of the underlying hedged item, was less than $0.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 , 2020 and 2019. this analysis excludes any offsetting effect from the forecasted future transactions that are economically hedged. see note 20 for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.
exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. we apply policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. to test the effectiveness of our hedging actions, for interest rate risk we assumed that, on january 1, 2022, interest rates decreased by 100 basis points and the decrease remained in place for the next 12 months and for currency risk of assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies, we evaluated the effect of a 10% shift in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar (usd). the analyses indicated that our 2021 consolidated net earnings would decline by $0.1 billion for interest rate risk and less than $0.1 billion for foreign exchange risk.
libor reform. in connection with the transition away from the use of the london interbank offered rate (libor) as an interest rate benchmark, the ice benchmark administration limited (iba) plans to cease the remaining usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30, 2023. the company's most significant exposures to libor relate to preferred stock and certain floating-rate debt securities issued by the company, which use usd libor. such preferred stock and floating rate debt are governed by new york law.
on april 6, 2021, new york state legislation addressing the cessation of usd libor was signed into law, which provides a statutory remedy for contracts that include contractual fallback language that requires the selection of a benchmark replacement rate based on usd libor, such as our floating rate debt and preferred stock. on the date usd libor permanently ceases to be published or is announced to no longer be representative, our floating rate debt and preferred stock will be deemed to be replaced by the "recommended benchmark replacement", which is the secured overnight financing rate (sofr) plus a spread adjustment.
additionally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we are managing the transition from libor based on industry-wide libor reform efforts, including the libor protocols issued by the international swaps and derivatives association.
we are in the process of managing the transition, and any financial impact will be accounted for under accounting standards update (asu) 2020-04, reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.
statement of cash flows cash flows from continuing operations. the most significant source of cash in cfoa is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and post retirement plans. ge measures itself on a free cash flows* basis. this metric includes cfoa plus investments in property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software; this metric excludes any cash received from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. we believe that investors may also find it useful to compare free cash flows* performance without the effects of cash flows for taxes related to business sales, contributions to the ge pension plan, discontinued factoring programs, operating activities related to our run-off insurance business and eliminations related to our receivables factoring and supply chain finance programs. we believe this measure will better allow management and investors to evaluate the capacity of our operations to generate free cash flows.
the cfoa impact from factoring programs discontinued in 2021 of $(5,108) million represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the nine months ended december 31, 2021 had customer receivables not been previously sold to wcs or third parties in those discontinued programs. the cfoa impact associated with this activity in factoring programs that have now been discontinued was $(5,847) million and $(3,361) million in the year ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $(2,487) million. the cfoa impact for the three months ended december 31, 2020 was $(1,377) million. the cfoa impact from receivables factoring and supply chain finance eliminations represents activity related to those internal programs previously facilitated for our industrial segments by our working capital solutions business. we completed the exit from all internal factoring and supply chain finance programs in 2021 and therefore expect no future elimination activity related to these programs.

cash from operating activities was $0.9 billion in 2021, a decrease of $0.1 billion compared with 2020, primarily due to: an increase in financial services-related cash collateral paid net of settlements on derivative contracts of $3.0 billion, which is a standard market practice to minimize derivative counterparty exposures; an increase in cash used for working capital of $1.5 billion; a decrease in employee benefit liabilities (a component of all other operating activities) of $0.3 billion; partially offset by lower ge pension plan contributions (which are excluded from free cash flows*) of $2.5 billion; and an increase in net income (after adjusting for the gain on the sale of biopharma, non-cash losses related to our interest in baker hughes, goodwill impairments, provision for income taxes, non-operating benefit costs and non-operating debt extinguishment costs) primarily due to covid-19 pandemic impacts in our aviation segment in 2020. there was a $0.5 billion and $0.6 billion increase in aviation-related customer allowance accruals in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
we utilized the provision of the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) which allows employers to defer the payment of social security taxes and, as a result, we deferred $0.3 billion as of december 31, 2020. in accordance with the underlying terms, the company paid 50% of this balance during the fourth quarter of 2021. the remaining 50% is expected to be paid in 2022.
*non-gaap financial measure
2021 form 10-k changes in working capital compared to prior year were as follows: current receivables of $1.1 billion, driven by a lower decrease in sales of receivables to third parties of $0.9 billion; inventories, including deferred inventory, of $(1.8) billion, driven by higher material purchases and lower liquidations; current contract assets of $(0.6) billion, driven by lower net unfavorable changes in estimated profitability at aviation partially offset by the timing of revenue recognition relative to billings and collections on our long-term equipment contracts; accounts payable and equipment project accruals of $0.6 billion, driven by lower disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods; progress collections and current deferred income of $(0.8) billion, driven by higher net liquidations. progress collections and current deferred income included lower early payments received at our aviation military equipment business of $0.3 billion from a foreign government in 2021 compared to $0.7 billion from the u.s. department of defense in 2020.
cash from investing activities was $23.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $4.4 billion compared with 2020, primarily due to: an increase in proceeds of $3.7 billion from the sales of our retained ownership interest in baker hughes; an increase in proceeds of $1.8 billion from business dispositions ($22.4 billion from the combination of our gecas business with aercap in 2021, compared with $20.5 billion from the sale of our biopharma business in 2020); partially offset by the acquisition of bk medical by our healthcare business of $1.5 billion. cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which are components of free cash flows*, was $1.4 billion in 2021, down $0.4 billion compared with 2020. cash received related to net settlements between our continuing operations and businesses in discontinued operations (primarily gecas) was $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is a component of all other investing activities.
cash used for financing activities was $45.3 billion in 2021, an increase of $25.5 billion compared with 2020, primarily due to: higher payments for debt extinguishments of $22.7 billion; higher other net debt maturities of $5.3 billion; lower cash settlements of $0.7 billion on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt partially offset by nonrecurrence of repayments of commercial paper of $3.0 billion in 2020. we paid cash to repurchase long term debt of $39.2 billion and $16.5 billion, including debt extinguishment costs of $7.2 billion and $0.3 billion, excluding a non-cash debt basis adjustment of $0.6 billion and an insignificant amount in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
cash from operating activities was $1.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of $7.8 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: a general decrease in net income (after adjusting for the gain on the sale of biopharma, non-cash losses related to our interest in baker hughes, goodwill impairments, provision for income taxes, non-operating benefit costs, non-operating debt extinguishment costs and a non-cash charge related to our premium deficiency testing in 2019, which is a component of all other operating activities), primarily due to covid-19 impacts in our aviation segment; ge pension plan contributions (which are excluded from free cash flows*) of $2.5 billion; partially offset by increase in financial services-related cash collateral received net of settlements on derivative contracts of $0.6 billion; and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes of $0.5 billion. increases in aviation-related customer allowance accruals (which is a component of all other operating activities) of $0.6 billion were $0.2 billion higher compared with 2019.
we utilized the provision of the cares act which allows employers to defer the payment of social security taxes and, as a result, we deferred $0.3 billion as of december 31, 2020.
changes in working capital compared to prior year were as follows: current receivables of $1.5 billion, driven by lower volume, partially offset by a higher decrease in sales of receivables to third parties of $2.6 billion; inventories, including deferred inventory, of $2.7 billion, primarily driven by lower material purchases, partially offset by lower liquidations; current contract assets of $0.7 billion, primarily due to a net unfavorable change in estimated profitability of $1.2 billion at aviation; accounts payable and equipment project accruals of $(3.3) billion, driven by lower volume in 2020 and higher disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods; progress collections and current deferred income of $(1.7) billion, driven by higher net liquidations. progress collections and current deferred income included early payments received at our aviation military equipment business of $0.7 billion in 2020 as part of the u.s. department of defense's efforts to support vendors in its supply chain during the covid-19 pandemic.
cash from investing activities was $19.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $7.1 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: net proceeds from the sale of our biopharma business in 2020 of $20.5 billion; partially offset by the nonrecurrence of proceeds from the spin-off of our transportation business of $6.2 billion (including the sale of our retained ownership interests in wabtec); lower proceeds from sales of our stake in baker hughes of $2.6 billion (including the sale of a portion of our retained ownership interests in 2020); higher net purchases of equity investments of $1.5 billion and lower cash received related to net settlements between our continuing operations and businesses in discontinued operations of $1.5 billion (both components of all other investing activities); and lower other business dispositions of $1.1 billion. cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which are components of free cash flows*, was $1.7 billion in 2020, down $0.8 billion compared with 2019.
cash used for financing activities was $19.8 billion in 2020, an increase of $4.1 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: higher payments for debt extinguishments of $11.4 billion; a reduction in commercial paper of $3.0 billion; partially offset by an increase in other net debt issuances of $9.4 billion and lower cash settlements of $1.1 billion on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt. we paid cash to repurchase long term debt of $16.5 billion and $5.1 billion, including cash paid for debt extinguishment costs of $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
cash flows from discontinued operations. cash from operating activities in 2021 related primarily to cash generated from earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in our gecas business. cash used for investing activities decreased in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to an increase in net purchases of plant, property and equipment partially offset by an increase in net collections of financing receivables.
*non-gaap financial measure
2021 form 10-k cash from operating activities in 2020 related primarily to cash generated from earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in our gecas business. cash used for investing activities decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 due to the deconsolidation of baker hughes cash as a result of the reduction in our ownership interest in the segment in the third quarter of 2019 partially offset by lower business dispositions.
supply chain finance programs. we facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs with third parties, which provide participating suppliers the opportunity to sell their ge receivables to third parties at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties. at december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, included in accounts payable was $3.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, of supplier invoices that are subject to the third-party programs. total supplier invoices paid through these third-party programs were $6.9 billion and $4.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
critical accounting estimates. accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates. see note 1 for further information on our most significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition on long-term services agreements. we have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our power and aviation segments that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. however, contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. we recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. this requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.
customers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major event within the contract such as an overhaul. as a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. the estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. we generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.
to develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. in developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.
we routinely review estimates under long-term service agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.
we regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.
on december 31, 2021, our net long-term service agreements balance of $0.6 billion represents approximately 0.3% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $187.4 billion. our contracts (on average) are approximately 19.0% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. billings collected on these contracts were $10.0 billion and $9.6 billion during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. see notes 1 and 8 for further information.
impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets. we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter. in assessing the possibility that a reporting unit's fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates, we consider all available evidence, including (i) the results of our impairment testing from the most recent testing date (in particular, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed), (ii) downward revisions to internal forecasts or decreases in market multiples (and the magnitude thereof), if any, and (iii) declines in market capitalization below book value (and the magnitude and duration of those declines), if any.
we determine fair value for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. if multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
2021 form 10-k valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. a market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses.
under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. discount rates used in our annual reporting unit valuations ranged from 11.5% to 20.5%.
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, possible control premiums, determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the appropriate weighting applied to each approach. it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. to determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. see notes 1 and 7 for further information.
insurance and investment contracts. refer to the other items - insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. see notes 1 and 11 for further information.
pension assumptions. refer to note 12 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.
income taxes. our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. historically u.s. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. due to the enactment of u.s. tax reform, repatriations of available cash from foreign earnings are expected to be free of u.s. federal income tax but may incur withholding or state taxes. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations. at december 31, 2021, we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of tax reform but we reassess this on an ongoing basis. in december 2021, the company announced plans to form three public companies focused on aviation, healthcare and energy. planning for and execution of this separation will result in tax including potentially tax on changes in indefinite reinvestment outside the u.s. the impact of a change in reinvestment will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which heavily rely on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-u.s. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. of this, $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our legacy financial services businesses. see other consolidated information - income taxes section and notes 1 and 14 for further information.
loss contingencies. loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. see note 22 for further information.
2021 form 10-k other items insurance. the run-off insurance operations of north american life and health (nalh) primarily include employers reassurance corporation (erac) and union fidelity life insurance company (uflic). erac primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. uflic primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from genworth financial inc.(genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. the vast majority of nalh's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though erac and uflic have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. these long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. in many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on long-term care insurance policies.
our run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. the insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from december 31, 2020 to december 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.
in addition to nalh, electric insurance company (eic) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to ge and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
we regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. we believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to covid-19. however, the effects of covid-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. these monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.
key portfolio characteristics long-term care insurance contracts. the long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. for example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.
the erac long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.
the uflic long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.
presented in the table below are gaap and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.

structured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. we reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. these structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than- average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.
our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. as of december 31, 2021, across our u.s. and canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. in 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. the covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. we anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.
investment portfolio and other adjustments. our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our december 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. the portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of december 31, 2021.
in calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. to the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to accumulated other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. this adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. see note 3 for further information about our investment securities.
we manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. this process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. with the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from changes in the prices of equity instruments). we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria.
2021 form 10-k our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $31.0 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either erac or uflic as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of erac or uflic which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.
critical accounting estimates. our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.
future policy benefit reserves. future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.
claim reserves. claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.
reinsurance recoverables. we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on long-term care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. these receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption all other assets in our statement of financial position.
premium deficiency testing. we annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. the premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. a comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. the vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. in order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.
morbidity. morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. for long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.
2021 form 10-k rate of change in morbidity. our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim cost curves. these estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. this exercise of judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual testing, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base projections, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and health-care technology development. with respect to industry developments, we take into account that there are differences between and among industry peers in portfolio characteristics (such as demographic features of the insured populations), the aggregate effect of morbidity improvement or deterioration as applied to base claim cost projections, the extent to which such base cost projections reflect the most current experience, and the accepted diversity of practice in actuarial professional judgment. we assess the potential for any change in morbidity with reference to our existing base claim cost projections, reconstructed in 2017. projected improvement or deterioration in morbidity can have a material impact on our future claim cost projections, both on a stand-alone basis and also by virtue of influencing other variables such as discount rate and premium rate increases.
mortality. mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments.
discount rate. interest rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on expected investment yields, net of related investment expenses and expected defaults. in estimating future investment yields, we consider the actual yields on our current investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations and the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturities, net of other operating cash flows, and the projected future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations. lower future investment yields result in a lower discount rate and a higher present value of future policy benefit reserves.
future long-term care premium rate increases. long-term care insurance policies allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. as a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. while we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. the amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. we consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations. higher future premium rate increases lower the present value of future policy benefit reserves and lower future premium rate increases increase the present value of future policy benefit reserves.
terminations. terminations refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to either mortality, lapse (non-payment of premiums by a policyholder), or, in the case of long-term care insurance, benefit exhaustion. termination rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment. lower termination rates increase, while higher termination rates decrease, the present value of expected future benefit payments.
in 2017, based on elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance contracts, we initiated a comprehensive review of all premium deficiency testing assumptions across all insurance products, resulting in a reconstruction of our future claim cost projections for long-term care insurance products. while our long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some emerging modest favorable experience, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. however, the extent of actual experience since 2017 to date is limited in the context of a long-tailed, multi-decade portfolio.
2021 premium deficiency testing. we completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2021. these procedures included updating experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2020, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. our 2021 premium deficiency testing started with the positive margin of less than 2% of the recorded future policy benefit reserves that resulted from our 2020 premium deficiency testing. using updated assumptions, the 2021 premium deficiency testing results indicated a significant increase in the positive margin to approximately 11% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at september 30, 2021. as a result, the assumptions updated in connection with the premium deficiency recognized in 2019 remain locked-in and will remain so unless another premium deficiency occurs in the future.
2021 form 10-k the significant increase in the premium deficiency testing margin resulting from our 2021 premium deficiency testing was largely attributable to an increase in the overall discount rate to a weighted average rate of 6.15% compared to 5.70% in 2020 ($2.2 billion). this increase in the discount rate from 2020 reflects further progress of our previously communicated investment portfolio realignment strategy, that includes increased amounts allocated to growth assets, consisting of private equity, equity-like securities and select high yield credit strategies, from our previous target of approximately 8% up to approximately 15%. these amounts are expected to be funded over the next 5 to 7 years from the remaining projected capital contribution of approximately $5.5 billion through 2024 and regular portfolio cash flows while maintaining an overall a-rated fixed income portfolio. the 2021 discount rate assumptions also reflect a lower expected reinvestment rate on fixed-income investments versus that applied in 2020, due to lower prevailing benchmark interest rates in the u.s, grading to a lower expected long-term average investment yield over a shorter period and slightly lower actual yields on our fixed-income investment security portfolio. as a result of this increased allocation to higher-yielding assets, our run-off insurance operations may experience future earnings volatility due to investments carried at fair value with changes in fair values reported in earnings and changes in the allowance for credit losses, and temporary elevated amounts of unfunded investment commitments.
while our observed long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some modest favorable emerging morbidity experience in the period since the 2017 reconstruction of our future claim cost projections, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. based on the application of professional actuarial judgment to the factors discussed above, we have made no substantial change to our assumptions concerning morbidity, morbidity improvement, mortality, mortality improvement, terminations, or long-term care insurance premium rate increases in 2021. as with all assumptions underlying our premium deficiency testing, we will continue to monitor these factors, which may result in future changes in our assumptions.
since our premium deficiency testing performed in 2020, we have implemented approximately $0.2 billion of previously approved long-term care insurance premium rate increase actions and made no substantial changes to the amount of projected future premium rate increase approvals. our 2021 premium deficiency test includes approximately $1.7 billion of anticipated future premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, of which approximately $0.9 billion has been approved and not yet implemented. this represents a decrease of $0.2 billion from our 2020 premium deficiency test to account for actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030 and includes the effects of the higher discount rate mentioned above and longer anticipated timing to achieve and implement certain premium rate approvals.
as a result of exposure period cut-off dates to permit experience to develop and lags in ceding company data reporting from our ceding companies, the impact of covid-19 was generally not reflected in the experience studies data used in our 2021 premium deficiency testing. however, we assessed certain scenarios to better understand potential impacts associated with covid-19 and, due to the currently observed insignificance and perceived short-term nature of such uncertain future impacts, including the natural offsets from mortality in the aggregate across our run-off insurance products (i.e., for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments), concluded adjustments to our primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency testing were not warranted.
when results of the premium deficiency testing indicate overall reserves are sufficient, we are also required to assess whether additional future policy benefit reserves are required to be accrued over time in the future. such an accrual would be required if profits are projected in earlier future periods followed by losses projected in later future years (i.e., profits followed by losses). when this pattern of profits followed by losses is projected, we would be required to accrue a liability in the expected profitable years by the amount necessary to offset projected losses in later future years. we noted our projections as of third quarter 2021 indicate the present value of projected earnings in each future year to be positive, and therefore, no further adjustments to our future policy benefit reserves were required at this time.
gaap reserve sensitivities. the results of our premium deficiency testing are sensitive to the assumptions described above. considering the results of the 2021 premium deficiency test which resulted in a margin, any future net adverse changes in our assumptions may reduce the margin or result in a premium deficiency requiring an increase to future policy benefit reserves. for example, hypothetical adverse changes in key assumptions related to our future policy benefits reserves, holding all other assumptions constant, would have the following estimated increase to the projected present value of future cash flows as presented in the table below. any future net favorable changes to these assumptions could result in a lower projected present value of future cash flows and additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio, including higher investment income. the assumptions within our future policy benefit reserves are subject to significant uncertainties, including those inherent in the complex nature of our reinsurance treaties. many of our assumptions are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities, the use of different factors or effect from converting to modeling future cash flow projections for our long-term insurance exposures to a "first principles" model based on more granular assumptions of expected future claim experience could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below.

statutory considerations. our run-off insurance subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices. statutory accounting practices, not gaap, determine the minimum required statutory capital levels of our insurance legal entities. we annually perform statutory asset adequacy testing and expect our december 31, 2021 testing process to be completed in the first quarter of 2022, the results of which may affect the amount or timing of capital contributions from ge to the insurance legal entities.
statutory accounting practices are set forth by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) as well as state laws, regulation and general administrative rules and differ in certain respects from gaap. under statutory accounting practices, base formulaic reserve assumptions typically do not change unless approved by our primary regulator, kid. in addition to base reserves, statutory accounting practices require additional actuarial reserves (aar) be established based on results of asset adequacy testing reflecting moderately adverse conditions (i.e., assumptions include a provision for adverse deviation (pad) rather than current assumptions without a pad as required for premium deficiency testing under gaap). as a result, our statutory asset adequacy testing assumptions reflect less long-term care insurance morbidity improvement and for shorter durations, restrictions on future long-term care insurance premium rate increases, no life insurance mortality improvement and a lower discount rate, among other differences. as a result, several of the sensitivities described in the table above would be less impactful on our statutory reserves.
the adverse impact on our statutory aar arising from our revised assumptions in 2017, including the collectability of reinsurance recoverables, is expected to require approximately $14.5 billion of additional capital to our run-off insurance subsidiaries in 2018-2024. for statutory accounting purposes, kid approved our request for a permitted accounting practice to recognize the 2017 aar increase over a seven-year period. capital of $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion were contributed to our run-off insurance subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. we expect to provide further capital contributions of approximately $5.5 billion through 2024 (of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our december 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing), subject to ongoing monitoring by kid. ge is a party to capital maintenance agreements with erac and uflic under which ge is required to maintain their minimum statutory capital levels at 300% of their year-end authorized control level risk-based capital requirements as defined from time to time by the naic.
2021 form 10-k if our future policy benefit reserves established under gaap are realized over the estimated remaining life of our run-off insurance obligations, we would expect the $14.5 billion of capital contributed to the run-off insurance operations over the 2018 to 2024 period to be considered statutory capital surplus at the end of the estimated remaining life with no additional charge to gaap earnings. however, should the more conservative statutory assumptions be realized, we would be required to record the difference between gaap assumptions and statutory assumptions as a charge to gaap earnings in the future periods. see other items - new accounting standards and notes 1 and 11 for further information.
new accounting standards. the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance contracts that is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1, 2023, with an election to adopt early, and restatement of prior periods presented. we intend to adopt the new guidance effective january 1, 2023 (with transition adjustments as of january 1, 2021), using the modified retrospective transition method where permitted. we are evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and anticipate that its adoption will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities. the new guidance requires cash flow assumptions used in the measurement of various insurance liabilities to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumptions need to be revised with any required changes recorded in earnings. under the current accounting guidance, the discount rate is based on expected investment yields, while under the new guidance the discount rate will be equivalent to the upper-medium grade (i.e., single a) fixed-income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liability and is required to be updated in each reporting period with changes recorded in other comprehensive income. we expect that the single-a rate under the new guidance at the transition date will be lower than our current discount rate. in measuring the insurance liabilities under the new guidance, contracts shall not be grouped together from different issue years. these changes will result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustments. while we continue to evaluate the effect of the new guidance on our ongoing financial reporting, we anticipate that its adoption will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. as the new guidance is only applicable to the measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities under gaap, it will not affect the accounting for our insurance reserves or the levels of capital and surplus under statutory accounting practices.
non-gaap financial measures. we believe that presenting non-gaap financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. this includes adjustments in recent periods to gaap financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business. in addition, management recognizes that certain non-gaap terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. in various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-gaap financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically organic revenues by segment; organic revenues, and equipment and services organic revenues (2) profit, specifically organic profit and profit margin by segment; adjusted profit and profit margin (excluding certain items); adjusted organic profit and profit margin; adjusted earnings (loss); and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (eps). the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow.

the service cost for our pension and other benefit plans are included in adjusted earnings*, which represents the ongoing cost of providing pension benefits to our employees. the components of non-operating benefit costs are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance. we believe the retained costs in adjusted earnings* and adjusted eps* provides management and investors a useful measure to evaluate the performance of the total company and increases period-to-period comparability. we also use adjusted eps* as a performance metric at the company level for our annual executive incentive plan for 2021.

five-year performance graph management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a). the consolidated financial statements of general electric company are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in u.s. dollars in millions. certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. discussions throughout this md&a are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. the md&a should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.
in the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap. certain of these data are considered "non-gaap financial measures" under sec rules. see the non-gaap financial measures section for the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
changes in financial reporting. on november 1, 2021, we completed the combination of our ge capital aviation services (gecas) business with aercap holdings n.v. (aercap). upon completion of this transaction, in order to focus on our core industrial businesses of aviation, healthcare, renewable energy and power, we voluntarily transitioned from three-column to simpler one-column reporting for all periods presented.
previously, we presented our financial statements in a three-column format, which allowed investors to see our industrial operations separately from our financial services operations (ge capital). moving to one-column consolidated financial statements reflects the reduction in size of our financial services portfolio as a result of various strategic actions taken over recent years.
we also made these related reporting changes for all periods presented:
•began presenting the results of the remainder of our former capital segment, including energy financial services (efs) and our run-off insurance operations, within corporate;
•reclassified amounts related to our efs, working capital solutions (wcs) and treasury businesses from our formerly captioned ge capital revenues from services to other income to align with our industrial segment presentation of derivative, equity method and other investment income. there was no change to the presentation of our run-off insurance revenues and, consequently, our run-off insurance revenues are now presented as a separate line in our statement of earnings (loss);
•reclassified our formerly captioned financing receivables and other ge capital receivables to all other assets to further simplify our statement of financial position given the reduction of these balances over time in relation to consolidated total assets;
•ceased referring to ge industrial, a term formerly defined as the adding together of all industrial affiliates giving effect to the elimination of transactions among such affiliates. therefore, all key performance indicators and non-gaap financial metrics previously identified as pertaining to ge industrial have been redefined to reflect total company results; and
•redefined the basis on which profit is determined for the remainder of our former capital segment which is now reported within corporate. previously, interest and other financial charges, income taxes, non-operating benefit costs and preferred stock dividends were included in determining our former capital segment profit (which we sometimes referred to as net earnings). to align with our industrial segments, these items are now excluded in determining profit for all businesses reported within corporate except efs, which will continue to be reported on a net earnings basis given the integral nature of production tax credits (ptcs) and investment tax credits (itcs) in relation to its business model.
2021 form 10-k in addition, effective december 31, 2021, we have changed the way we present sales of spare parts, upgrade equipment and other aftermarket goods that are used in the provision of our services in our statement of earnings (loss) to conform with the way we manage the businesses and have historically presented them in md&a and other related notes. specifically, we now consistently present sales of spare parts used in a service arrangement as part of sales of services and the related costs as costs of services sold. see note 1 for further information.
consolidated results significant developments. ge announced it plans to form three public companies focused on the growth sectors of aviation, healthcare and energy. in november 2021, we announced a strategic plan to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies from our (i) aviation business, (ii) healthcare business and (iii) renewable energy, power and digital businesses that we will combine. we intend to pursue a tax-free spin-off of healthcare in early 2023, creating a pure play company at the center of precision health, and we expect to retain a stake of 19.9% in the new company. we intend to pursue a tax-free spin-off of the combined renewable energy, power and digital businesses in early 2024, and that new company will be positioned to lead the energy transition. following these transactions, ge will be an aviation-focused company, shaping the future of flight. as independently run companies, each can benefit from greater focus, tailored capital allocation, and strategic flexibility to deliver long-term growth and create value for customers, investors and employees. the respective capital structures, brands and leadership teams for each independent company will be determined and announced later.
coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has impacted global economies, resulting in workforce and travel restrictions, supply chain and production disruptions and reduced demand and spending across many sectors. since the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, these factors have had a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. while factors related directly and indirectly to the covid-19 pandemic have been impacting operations and financial performance at varying levels across all our businesses, the most significant impact to date has been at our aviation segment. for details about impacts related to our businesses and actions we have taken in response, as applicable, refer to the respective segment sections within md&a. we anticipate that our operations and financial performance will continue to be impacted by the covid-19 pandemic in future periods. these impacts will ultimately depend on many factors that are not within our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; the emergence of covid-19 virus variants; and the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines.
gecas. on november 1, 2021, we completed the combination of our gecas business with aercap and received $22.6 billion in cash, subject to future closing adjustments, 111.5 million shares of aercap common stock (approximately 46% ownership interest) valued at approximately $6.6 billion based on aercap's closing share price on october 29, 2021, and a $1.0 billion aercap senior note. in connection with the closing of the transaction, the company recorded a non-cash after-tax charge of $3.9 billion in discontinued operations in 2021, including a loss of $0.2 billion in the fourth quarter. additionally, we have elected to prospectively measure our investment in aercap at fair value and expect to have continuing involvement with aercap, primarily through our ownership interest and ongoing sales or leases of products and services. we expect to fully monetize our stake in aercap over time. see notes 2 and 3 for further information.
liability management actions. during 2021, we completed debt tenders to repurchase a total of $32.6 billion of debt, comprising $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. the total after-tax loss on these actions was $6.1 billion ($6.5 billion pre-tax), comprising an after-tax loss of $1.1 billion ($1.4 billion pre-tax) in the second quarter of 2021 and an after-tax loss of $5.0 billion ($5.1 billion pre-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2021. the majority of the loss relates to the present value of accelerating future interest payments associated with the debt. as a result of these actions, we expect lower interest expense going forward.
factoring. effective april 1, 2021, we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we subsequently discontinued our remaining unconsolidated receivables facility. for the nine months ended december 31, 2021, the adverse impact to ge businesses' cash flows from operating activities (cfoa) was $5.1 billion, including $1.6 billion related to the unconsolidated receivables facility in the fourth quarter, which primarily represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the period had customer receivables not been previously sold and is excluded from free cash flows*. the adverse cfoa impact associated with activity in factoring programs that have now been discontinued was $5.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021.
reverse stock split. in the second quarter of 2021, we announced that we would proceed with the 1-for-8 reverse stock split, as approved by shareholders, and filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effectuate the reverse stock split after the close of trading on july 30, 2021. ge common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on august 2, 2021. our shares of outstanding common stock and earnings per share calculation have been retroactively restated for all periods presented.
bk medical. in the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired bk medical, a leader in surgical ultrasound imaging and guidance, from altaris capital partners for a cash purchase price of $1.5 billion.
*non-gaap financial measure
2021 form 10-k summary of 2021 results. total revenues were $74.2 billion, down $1.6 billion for the year, driven primarily by decreases at aviation, power and healthcare.
continuing earnings (loss) per share was $(3.25). excluding debt extinguishment costs, gains (losses) on equity securities, non-operating benefit costs, earnings from our run-off insurance business and restructuring and other charges, adjusted earnings per share* was $1.71. for the year ended december 31, 2021, profit (loss) was $(3.7) billion and profit margins were (5.0)%, down $9.7 billion, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of the prior year gain on the sale of our biopharma business of $12.4 billion and higher debt extinguishment costs of $6.2 billion, partially offset by a higher net gain on equity securities of $3.8 billion, higher segment profit of $1.9 billion, the nonrecurrence of goodwill impairments of $0.9 billion, a decrease in non-operating benefit costs of $0.6 billion, a decrease in adjusted corporate operating costs* of $0.4 billion, higher profit on our run-off insurance business of $0.4 billion, the nonrecurrence of steam asset impairments in the prior year of $0.4 billion, lower interest and other financial charges of $0.2 billion, and the nonrecurrence of the legal reserves associated with the sec investigation in the prior year of $0.2 billion. adjusted organic profit* increased $2.7 billion, driven primarily by increases at aviation, power and healthcare. additionally, we continue to experience inflation pressure in our supply chain as well as delays in sourcing key materials needed for our products. the most significant impact to date has been at our healthcare segment, which has delayed our ability to convert remaining performance obligation (rpo) to revenue. while we are taking actions to limit this pressure, we may experience a greater impact on our longer cycle businesses in future periods.
cash flows from operating activities were $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. cfoa decreased primarily due to an increase in cash collateral paid net of settlements on derivative contracts and an increase in cash used for working capital, partially offset by lower ge pension plan contributions (which are excluded from free cash flows (fcf)*) and an increase in net income (after adjusting for the gain on the sale of biopharma, non-cash gains/losses related to our interest in baker hughes, non-operating benefit costs and non-operating debt extinguishment costs). fcf* were $1.9 billion and $0.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. fcf* increased primarily due to an increase in net income (after adjusting for the gain on the sale of biopharma, non-cash gains/losses related to our interest in baker hughes, non-operating benefit costs and non-operating debt extinguishment costs) and an increase in cash from working capital (after adjusting for the impact from discontinued factoring programs and eliminations related to our receivables factoring and supply chain finance programs), partially offset by an increase in cash collateral paid net of settlements on derivative contracts. we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs in 2021. in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, the adverse impact to cfoa was $5.1 billion, which primarily represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the period had customer receivables not been previously sold and is excluded from fcf*. see the capital resources and liquidity - statement of cash flows section for further information.
rpo is unfilled customer orders for products and product services (expected life of contract sales for product services) excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty. in the second quarter of 2021, we voluntarily replaced our quarterly disclosures of backlog with rpo as a key metric, one commonly used across our industries, in order to simplify our reporting and align with our peers. see note 23 for further information.
(a) rpo as of december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020 excludes the biopharma business due to its disposition in the first quarter of 2020. rpo as of december 31, 2019 included $1,227 million related to biopharma.
as of december 31, 2021, rpo increased $9.2 billion (4%) from december 31, 2020, primarily at aviation, from engines contracted under long-term service agreements that have now been put into service; at healthcare, from new contracts and renewals with large customers as well as supply chain challenges in converting rpo to revenue; and at renewable energy, primarily at offshore wind; partially offset by a decrease at power from sales outpacing new orders in gas power and the continued wind down of the steam power new build coal business.
as of december 31, 2020, rpo decreased $14.8 billion (6%) from december 31, 2019 primarily driven by aviation due to a reduction in commercial services. the reduction in commercial services reflects lower anticipated engine utilization, the cancellation of equipment unit orders, customer fleet restructuring and contract modifications. power decreased due to sales outpacing new orders; healthcare decreased with the disposition of the biopharma business of $1.2 billion; and renewable energy increased due to new orders outpacing sales.
*non-gaap financial measure
2021 form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, total revenues decreased $1.6 billion (2%). equipment revenues decreased primarily at power, due to decreased gas power equipment revenues on lower turnkey sales and steam power equipment on the exit of new build coal; at aviation, due to fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments; and at healthcare, due to the disposition of the biopharma business; partially offset by an increase at renewable energy driven by higher revenue at offshore wind. services revenues increased primarily at power, due to an increase in gas power and steam power services revenues; at healthcare, due to increased volume in imaging and ultrasound and a return to pre-pandemic volume in pharmaceutical diagnostics; and at aviation, primarily due to increased shop visit volume; partially offset by a decrease at renewable energy, primarily due to lower repower unit deliveries at onshore wind. insurance revenues increased $0.2 billion (8)%. the decrease in revenues included the net effects of acquisitions of $0.1 billion, the net effects of dispositions of $1.5 billion and the effects of a stronger u.s. dollar of $1.0 billion. excluding insurance revenues and the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency, organic revenues* decreased $1.5 billion (2%), with equipment revenues down $3.0 billion (8%) and services revenues up $1.5 billion (4%). organic revenues* decreased at aviation, power and renewable energy, partially offset by an increase at healthcare.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, total revenues decreased $14.4 billion (16%). the decrease in services revenues was primarily at aviation, driven by lower commercial spare part shipments, decreased shop visits and the cumulative impact of changes in billing and cost assumptions in our long-term service agreements; and at power, due to declines in transactional part sales and upgrades at gas power. the decrease in equipment revenues was primarily at aviation, due to fewer commercial install and spare engine unit shipments; and at healthcare, due to the disposition of the biopharma business; partially offset by increases at renewable energy, primarily from onshore wind with more wind turbine shipments than in the prior year, and offshore wind; and at gas power, due to an increase in heavy-duty gas turbine unit shipments. insurance revenues increased $0.1 billion (2%). the decrease in revenues included the net effects of acquisitions of $0.1 billion, the net effects of dispositions of $3.6 billion and the effects of a weaker u.s. dollar of $0.3 billion. excluding insurance revenues and the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency, organic revenues* decreased $10.7 billion (13%), with a decrease in services revenues of $8.8 billion (20%) and a decrease in equipment revenues of $1.9 billion (5%). organic revenues* decreased at aviation and power, partially offset by increases at healthcare and renewable energy.

competition & regulation. the global businesses for aircraft jet engines, maintenance, component repair and overhaul services (including parts sales) are highly competitive. both domestic and international markets are important to the growth and success of the business. product development cycles are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success. research and development expenditures are important in this business, as are focused intellectual property strategies and protection of key aircraft engine design, manufacture, repair and product upgrade technologies. in addition, we are subject to market and regulatory dynamics related to decarbonization which will require a combination of technological innovation in the fuel efficiency of engines, expanding the use of sustainable aviation fuels and the development of electric flight and hydrogen-based aviation technologies. aircraft engine and systems orders tend to follow civil air travel demand and military procurement cycles.
our products, services and activities are subject to a number of global regulators such as the u.s. federal aviation administration (faa), european union aviation safety agency (easa), civil aviation administration of china (caac) and other regulatory bodies.
2021 form 10-k significant trends & developments. the global covid-19 pandemic continues to have a material adverse effect on the global airline industry, although aviation's results in 2021 reflect improvement in market fundamentals. a key underlying driver of aviation's commercial engine and services business is global commercial air traffic, which in turn is driven by economic activity and consumer and business propensity to travel. since the beginning of the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, we have seen varied levels of recovery in global markets. government travel restrictions, public health advisories, individuals' propensity to travel and continued cases of the virus have all impacted the level of air travel. aviation regularly tracks global departures, which for 2021, were approximately 30% below 2019. global departures improved during 2021, up approximately 20% compared to 2020, but levels of recovery varied across regions due in large part to the emergence of covid-19 virus variants. aviation remains confident in the recovery, while actively monitoring the impact of travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, and economic and industry forecasts. we are in frequent dialogue with our airline and airframe customers about the outlook for commercial air travel, new aircraft production, fleet retirements, and after-market services, including shop visit and spare parts demand. given current trends, we expect domestic travel routes primarily served by narrowbody aircraft to recover before long-haul, international travel routes, which are primarily served by widebody aircraft. consistent with industry projections, aviation continues to estimate the duration of the market recovery to be prolonged over the next couple of years, dependent on containing the spread of the virus, effective inoculation programs and government collaboration to encourage travel, particularly around reducing quarantine requirements.
aviation has taken several actions to respond to the current adverse environment and is actively monitoring the pace of demand recovery to ensure the business is appropriately sized for the future. in addition, we continue to partner with our airline and leasing customers and collaborate with our airframe partners on production rates for 2022 and beyond.
as it relates to the military environment, aviation continues to forecast strong military demand creating future growth opportunities for our military business unit as the u.s. department of defense and foreign governments have continued flight operations, and have allocated budgets to upgrade and modernize their existing fleets. during 2021, aviation experienced supply chain challenges impacting the delivery of military engines, which the business is actively addressing.
total engineering, comprising company, customer and partner-funded and nonrecurring engineering costs, decreased compared to prior year in line with the changes in the commercial environment and due to the timing of planned program expenditures. aviation continues to be committed to investment in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight. in june 2021, aviation and safran announced revolutionary innovation for sustainable engines (rise), a technology development program targeting more than 20% lower fuel consumption and co2 emissions compared to today's engines. in september 2021, aviation's catalyst engine, the first clean-sheet turboprop design entering the business and general aviation market in 50 years, completed its first flight.
aviation is taking actions to protect its ability to serve its customers now and as the global airline industry recovers. aviation's deep history of innovation and technology leadership, commercial engine installed base of approximately 39,400 units, with approximately 10,800 units under long-term service agreements, and military engine installed base of approximately 26,200 units represents strong long-term fundamentals. aviation expects to emerge from the covid-19 pandemic well-positioned to drive long-term profitable growth and cash generation over time.

for the year ended december 31, 2021, segment revenues were flat and segment losses were up $0.1 billion (11%).
rpo as of december 31, 2021 increased $0.7 billion (2%) from december 31, 2020 primarily driven by the offshore vineyard wind (u.s) and dogger bank (u.k.) wind farms and from higher onshore wind services, partially offset by equipment sales exceeding new orders at onshore and grid and the impact from a stronger u.s. dollar. the decrease at onshore wind is largely driven by ptc uncertainty delaying investment in north america, while at grid is primarily due to increased commercial selectivity in certain product lines.
revenues decreased $0.4 billion (2%) organically*, primarily from lower revenue at grid due to increased commercial selectivity and fewer wind turbine and repower deliveries at onshore wind, partially offset by higher revenue at offshore wind's legacy edf project.
segment losses increased 6% organically*, primarily from lower repower volume at onshore wind, lower volume at grid and lower margins on new product introductions at onshore wind, partially offset by the favorable impact of cost reduction actions and lower project related charges.

2021 form 10-k power. power serves power generation, industrial, government and other customers worldwide with products and services related to energy production. our products and technologies harness resources such as oil, gas, fossil, diesel and nuclear to produce electric power and include gas and steam turbines, full balance of plant, upgrade and service solutions, as well as data-leveraging software. we have organized the businesses within our power segment into gas power, steam, power conversion and nuclear and other.
gas power - offers a wide spectrum of heavy-duty and aeroderivative gas turbines for utilities, independent power producers and numerous industrial applications, ranging from small, mobile power to utility scale power plants. gas power also delivers maintenance and service solutions across total plant assets and over their operational lifecycle.
steam power - offers a broad portfolio of technologies and services predominately for nuclear and fossil power plants to help customers deliver reliable power as they transition to a lower carbon future.
power conversion, nuclear and other - applies the science and systems of power conversion to provide motors, generators, automation and control equipment and drives for energy intensive industries such as marine, oil and gas, mining, rail, metals and test systems. through joint ventures with hitachi, it also provides nuclear technology solutions for boiling water reactors including reactor design, reactor fuel and support services.
competition & regulation. worldwide competition for power generation products and services is intense. demand for power generation is global, and as a result, is sensitive to the economic and political environments of each country in which we do business. our products and services sold to end customers are often subject to many regulatory requirements and performance standards under different federal, state, foreign and energy industry standards. in addition, we are subject to market and other dynamics related to decarbonization, where it will remain important to lower greenhouse gas emissions for decades to come, which will likely depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today, but may become more important over time (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies or small modular or other advanced nuclear power).
significant trends & developments. power continues to streamline its business to better align with market demand and drive its business units with an operational rigor and discipline that is focused on its customers' lifecycle experience. we remain focused on our underwriting discipline, commercial selectivity and risk management to ensure we are securing deals that meet our financial hurdles and we have a high confidence to deliver for our customers.
during the current period, global gas generation was down low-single-digits due to higher gas prices. however, ge gas turbine utilization continues to be resilient as megawatt hours grew high-single-digits from incremental ha gas turbine units coming online running baseload power. looking ahead, we anticipate the power market to continue to be impacted by overcapacity in the industry, continued price pressure from competition on servicing the installed base, and the uncertain timing of deal closures due to financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets, as well as the ongoing impacts of covid-19. although market factors related to the energy transition such as greater renewable energy penetration and the adoption of climate change-related policies continue to impact long-term demand (and related financing), to differing degrees across markets globally, we expect the gas market to remain stable through the next decade with gas generation continuing to grow low-single-digits. we believe gas will play a critical role in the energy transition and are encouraged by the growth in gas power services.
as separately announced on february 10, 2022, we signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding for ge steam power to sell a portion of its business to électricité de france s.a. (edf), which will result in a reclassification of that business to held for sale in the first quarter of 2022. a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge will be taken related to the remaining business intangible and fixed assets of approximately $0.7 to $0.8 billion. the sale transaction is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2023, subject to completion of the parties' respective information and consultation processes and satisfaction of certain conditions, and closing the transaction is expected to result in a significant gain.
we continue to invest in new product development, such as our ha-turbines and nuclear small modular reactors. our fundamentals remain strong with approximately $68.7 billion in rpo and a gas turbine installed base greater than 7,000 units, including approximately 1,800 units under long-term service agreements.

for the year ended december 31, 2021, segment revenues were down $0.7 billion (4%) and segment profit was up $0.5 billion.
rpo as of december 31, 2021 decreased $4.6 billion (6%) from december 31, 2020, primarily driven by the continued wind down of the steam power new build coal business, sales outpacing new orders in gas power contractual services, and a significant gas power equipment order from the prior year that did not repeat.
revenues decreased $0.7 billion (4%) organically*, primarily due to decreased gas power equipment revenues on lower turnkey sales and steam power equipment on the exit of new build coal, partially offset by an increase in gas power and steam power services revenues.
profit increased $0.5 billion organically* due to increases in gas power services revenues and margins, predominately in the long-term services portfolio, and aeroderivative sales and continued efforts to streamline the businesses, partially offset by decreases due to gas power and steam power equipment revenues and contract and legal charges.

2021 form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2021, revenues remained relatively flat primarily as the result of $0.3 billion lower revenue due to the sale of our lighting business in june 2020 offset by $0.2 billion of higher revenue primarily as the result of strong investment results in our run-off insurance business and $0.2 billion of lower intersegment eliminations. corporate operating profit decreased by $6.3 billion due to $12.5 billion of lower gains on purchases and sales of business interests primarily due to a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of our biopharma business in 2020. this decrease was partially offset by a $3.8 billion change in gains (losses) on equity securities primarily related to $2.9 billion and $0.7 billion of mark-to-market activity on our baker hughes and aercap shares respectively. in addition, corporate operating profit increased due to lower restructuring and other charges primarily at aviation and corporate, partially offset by power, and nonrecurrence of non-cash impairment charges and settlement of the sec investigation in 2020, and higher income in our run-off insurance business primarily driven by strong investment results and lower claims.
adjusted total corporate operating costs* decreased by $0.4 billion primarily as the result of $0.5 billion of cost reductions in our corporate functions. in addition, corporate cost decreased by $0.2 billion as the result of lower intercompany elimination activity from project financing investments associated with wind energy projects in our renewable energy segment, lower intersegment eliminations, partially offset by higher spare engine sales from our aviation segment to our gecas business before its combination with aercap in november 2021. these decreases were partially offset by $0.2 billion of higher costs associated with ehs and other items.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, revenues decreased by $0.9 billion, primarily as a result of a $0.5 billion decrease in revenues due to the sale of our current and lighting businesses in april 2019 and june 2020, respectively, $0.5 billion of higher inter-segment eliminations, partially offset by $0.1 billion of higher revenue in our run-off insurance business. corporate operating profit increased by $11.2 billion due to $12.6 billion of higher gains on purchases and sales of business interests primarily due to a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of our biopharma business in 2020, partially offset by a $2.8 billion change in gains (losses) on equity securities primarily related to mark-to-market activity on our baker hughes shares. corporate operating profit also increased due to lower restructuring and other charges, primarily at corporate and power, partially offset by higher charges at aviation, lower non-cash impairment charges, partially offset by $0.2 billion for the settlement of the sec investigation in 2020. in addition, corporate profit increased by $1.0 billion due to the nonrecurrence of $1.0 billion pre-tax charge identified through our annual insurance premium deficiency review in our run-off insurance business in 2019.
adjusted total corporate operating costs* remained relatively flat in 2020 due to $0.2 billion of lower ehs and other items, $0.3 billion of cost reductions in our digital business and corporate functions, offset by $0.4 billion of higher costs in our ge capital businesses primarily due to lower gains from the sale of equity method investments at efs, higher marks and volume decline. overall, eliminations were relatively flat due to higher intercompany elimination activity from project financing investments associated with wind energy projects in our renewable energy segment, higher intersegment eliminations, offset by lower spare engine sales from our aviation segment to our previously owned gecas business.

2021 form 10-k interest and other financial charges were $1.9 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the decreases for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to lower average borrowings balances, partially offset by a lower allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations. inclusive of interest expense in discontinued operations, total interest and other financial charges were $2.5 billion, $3.0 billion and $4.2 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. the decreases for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 were driven primarily by lower average borrowings balances. the primary components of interest and other financial charges are interest on short- and long-term borrowings. see note 10 for further information about average interest rates on borrowings.
debt extinguishment costs were $6.5 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. during 2021, we executed debt tenders in the second and fourth quarters and incurred debt extinguishment costs of $1.4 billion in the second quarter and $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter. the majority of these costs relate to the present value of accelerating future interest payments associated with the debt. as a result of these actions, we expect lower interest expense going forward.

provision (benefit) for income taxes            $(286)          $(487)              $552
for the year ended december 31, 2021, the consolidated income tax rate was 7.8% compared to (8.2)% for the year ended december 31, 2020. the tax rate for 2021 reflects a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss. the negative tax rate for 2020 reflects a tax benefit on pre-tax income.
the consolidated benefit for income taxes was $(0.3) billion and $(0.5) billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the benefit decreased due to tax associated with the increase in pre-tax income excluding the gain from the sale of our biopharma business and debt extinguishment costs ($2.0 billion) and from the nonrecurrence of the tax benefit recognized in 2020 for the completion of the internal revenue service (irs) audit for 2014-2015 ($0.1 billion). the increase in pre-tax income includes realized and unrealized gain on our remaining interest in baker hughes in 2021, compared to realized and unrealized loss in 2020. partially offsetting these items was the nonrecurrence of the tax expense in 2020 associated with the disposition of the biopharma business ($1.1 billion), the tax benefit on the debt extinguishment costs ($0.4 billion) as well as tax benefits associated with internal restructurings to recognize deductible stock and loan losses ($0.4 billion).
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the consolidated income tax benefit was $0.5 billion. the change in tax from a tax provision of $0.6 billion in 2019 to a tax benefit for 2020 was primarily due to the decrease in pre-tax income excluding the gain from the sale of our biopharma business and non-deductible goodwill impairment charges ($1.5 billion) and a decrease in valuation allowances on non-u.s. deferred tax assets ($0.2 billion) partially offset by the increase in tax expense associated with the disposition of the biopharma business in 2020 compared to the amount recognized on preparatory steps for the planned disposition in 2019 ($0.5 billion) and a decrease in benefit from the completion of irs audits ($0.2 billion).
absent additional taxes enacted as part of u.s. tax reform and non-u.s. losses without a tax benefit, our consolidated income tax provision is generally reduced because of the benefits of lower-taxed global operations as certain non-u.s. income is subject to local country tax rates that are below the u.s. statutory tax rate.
the rate of tax on our profitable non-u.s. earnings is below the u.s. statutory tax rate because we have significant business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate and because ge funds certain non-u.s. operations through foreign companies that are subject to low foreign taxes. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations and as of december 31, 2021, we have not decided to repatriate these earnings to the u.s. given u.s. tax reform, substantially all of our net prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. tax and accordingly we generally expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-u.s. cash without additional u.s. federal tax cost and any foreign withholding taxes on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit. in december 2021, the company announced plans to form three public companies focused on aviation, healthcare and energy. planning for and execution of this separation will result in tax including potentially tax on changes in indefinite reinvestment outside the u.s. the impact of a change in reinvestment will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.
a substantial portion of the benefit for lower-taxed non-u.s. earnings related to business operations subject to tax in countries where the tax on that income is lower than the u.s. statutory rate is derived from our aviation operations located in singapore where the earnings are primarily taxed at a rate of 8% and our power operations located in switzerland where the earnings are taxed at between 9% and 18.6%.
2021 form 10-k the rate of tax on non-u.s. operations is increased, however, because we also incur losses in foreign jurisdictions where it is not likely that the losses can be utilized and no tax benefit is provided for those losses and valuation allowances against loss carryforwards are provided when it is no longer likely that the losses can be utilized. non-u.s. losses also limit our ability to claim u.s. foreign tax credits on certain operations, further increasing the rate of tax on non-u.s. operations. in addition, as part of u.s. tax reform, the u.s. has enacted a tax on "base eroding" payments from the u.s. we have taken restructuring actions to mitigate the impact from this provision. the u.s. has also enacted a minimum tax on foreign earnings (global intangible low tax income). because we have tangible assets outside the u.s. and pay significant foreign taxes, we generally do not expect a significant increase in tax liability from this new u.s. minimum tax. overall, these newly enacted provisions increase the rate of tax on our non-u.s. operations.

for the year ended december 31, 2021, the change from a benefit from global operations in 2020 to an expense from global operations in 2021 reflects lower benefits associated with legacy financial services operations.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, the change from an expense from global operations in 2019 to a benefit from global operations in 2020 primarily reflects decrease in valuation allowances on non-u.s. deferred tax assets.

capital resources and liquidity financial policy. we intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy with a sustainable investment-grade long-term credit rating. in the fourth quarter of 2021, the company announced plans to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade companies, each of which will determine their own financial policies, including capital allocation, dividend, mergers and acquisitions and buy back decisions.
liquidity policy. we maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to meet our business needs and financial obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. we believe that our consolidated liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.
consolidated liquidity. our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, free cash flows* from our operating businesses, cash generated from asset sales and dispositions, and short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities. cash generation can be subject to variability based on many factors, including seasonality, receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term contracts, market conditions and our ability to execute dispositions. total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $15.8 billion at december 31, 2021, of which $6.4 billion was held in the u.s. and $9.4 billion was held outside the u.s.

2021 form 10-k cash held in non-u.s. entities has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated earnings were subject to u.s. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding amounts held in countries with currency controls) without additional federal tax cost. any foreign withholding tax on a repatriation to the u.s. would potentially be partially offset by a u.s. foreign tax credit. with regards to our announcement to form three public companies, we expect that planning for and execution of this separation will impact indefinite reinvestment. the impact of that change will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.
cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at december 31, 2021 included $2.0 billion of cash held in countries with currency control restrictions and $0.3 billion of restricted use cash. cash held in countries with currency controls represents amounts held in countries that may restrict the transfer of funds to the u.s. or limit our ability to transfer funds to the u.s. without incurring substantial costs. restricted use cash represents amounts that are not available to fund operations, and primarily comprised funds restricted in connection with certain ongoing litigation matters. excluded from cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $0.4 billion of cash in our run-off insurance business, which was classified as all other assets in the statement of financial position.
in connection with the program we launched in 2020 to fully monetize our baker hughes position over approximately three years, we received total proceeds of $4.1 billion in 2021, including $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. in addition, we received $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022. in addition, we expect to fully monetize our stake in aercap over time.
we provided capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion in the first quarters of 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and expect to provide further capital contributions of approximately $5.5 billion through 2024, including approximately $2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our december 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. these contributions are subject to ongoing monitoring by the kansas insurance department (kid), and the total amount to be contributed could increase or decrease, or the timing could be accelerated, based upon the results of reserve adequacy testing or a decision by kid to modify the schedule of contributions set forth in january 2018. we are required to maintain specified capital levels at these insurance subsidiaries under capital maintenance agreements.
borrowings. consolidated total borrowings were $35.2 billion and $74.9 billion at december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, respectively, a decrease of $39.7 billion. the reduction in borrowings was driven by debt repurchases of $32.6 billion, net repayments and maturities of debt of $4.6 billion, $1.7 billion of fair value adjustments for debt in fair value hedge relationships, and $0.8 billion related to changes in foreign exchange rates and other amortization.
we have in place committed revolving credit facilities totaling $14.4 billion at december 31, 2021, comprised of a $10.0 billion unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and a total of $4.4 billion of bilateral revolving credit facilities.
liability management actions. during 2021, we completed debt tenders to repurchase a total of $32.6 billion of debt, comprising $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. see note 10 for further information.
credit ratings and conditions. we have relied, and may continue to rely, on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund, among other things, a significant portion of our operations. the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. moody's investors service (moody's), standard and poor's global ratings (s&p), and fitch ratings (fitch) currently issue ratings on our short- and long-term debt. as a result of our transition to one-column financial statement reporting in the fourth quarter of 2021, we are now presenting our credit ratings on a consolidated basis for the company. our credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the table below.
moody's        s&amp;p                    fitch outlook           negative       creditwatch negative       stable short term        p-2            a-2                        f3

we are disclosing our credit ratings and any current quarter updates to these ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds and access to liquidity. our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. for a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings, see the financial risks section of risk factors in this report.
substantially all of the company's debt agreements in place at december 31, 2021 do not contain material credit rating covenants. our unused back-up revolving syndicated credit facility and certain of our bilateral revolving credit facilities contain a customary net debt-to-ebitda financial covenant, which we satisfied at december 31, 2021.
the company may from time to time enter into agreements that contain minimum ratings requirements. the following table provides a summary of the maximum estimated liquidity impact in the event of further downgrades below each stated ratings level.
2021 form 10-k triggers below           at december 31, 2021
our most significant contractual ratings requirements are related to ordinary course commercial activities. the timing within the quarter of the potential liquidity impact of these areas may differ, as can the remedies to resolving any potential breaches of required ratings levels.
foreign exchange and interest rate risks. as a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. such principal currencies include the euro, the chinese renminbi, the indian rupee and japanese yen, among others. the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings, excluding the earnings impact of the underlying hedged item, was less than $0.1 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 , 2020 and 2019. this analysis excludes any offsetting effect from the forecasted future transactions that are economically hedged. see note 20 for further information about our risk exposures, our use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our financial statements.
exchange rate and interest rate risks are managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. we apply policies to manage each of these risks, including prohibitions on speculative activities. it is our policy to minimize currency exposures and to conduct operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedge strategies. to test the effectiveness of our hedging actions, for interest rate risk we assumed that, on january 1, 2022, interest rates decreased by 100 basis points and the decrease remained in place for the next 12 months and for currency risk of assets and liabilities denominated in other than their functional currencies, we evaluated the effect of a 10% shift in exchange rates against the u.s. dollar (usd). the analyses indicated that our 2021 consolidated net earnings would decline by $0.1 billion for interest rate risk and less than $0.1 billion for foreign exchange risk.
libor reform. in connection with the transition away from the use of the london interbank offered rate (libor) as an interest rate benchmark, the ice benchmark administration limited (iba) plans to cease the remaining usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june 30, 2023. the company's most significant exposures to libor relate to preferred stock and certain floating-rate debt securities issued by the company, which use usd libor. such preferred stock and floating rate debt are governed by new york law.
on april 6, 2021, new york state legislation addressing the cessation of usd libor was signed into law, which provides a statutory remedy for contracts that include contractual fallback language that requires the selection of a benchmark replacement rate based on usd libor, such as our floating rate debt and preferred stock. on the date usd libor permanently ceases to be published or is announced to no longer be representative, our floating rate debt and preferred stock will be deemed to be replaced by the "recommended benchmark replacement", which is the secured overnight financing rate (sofr) plus a spread adjustment.
additionally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we are managing the transition from libor based on industry-wide libor reform efforts, including the libor protocols issued by the international swaps and derivatives association.
we are in the process of managing the transition, and any financial impact will be accounted for under accounting standards update (asu) 2020-04, reference rate reform (topic 848): facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.
statement of cash flows cash flows from continuing operations. the most significant source of cash in cfoa is customer-related activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. the most significant operating use of cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and post retirement plans. ge measures itself on a free cash flows* basis. this metric includes cfoa plus investments in property, plant and equipment and additions to internal-use software; this metric excludes any cash received from dispositions of property, plant and equipment. we believe that investors may also find it useful to compare free cash flows* performance without the effects of cash flows for taxes related to business sales, contributions to the ge pension plan, discontinued factoring programs, operating activities related to our run-off insurance business and eliminations related to our receivables factoring and supply chain finance programs. we believe this measure will better allow management and investors to evaluate the capacity of our operations to generate free cash flows.
the cfoa impact from factoring programs discontinued in 2021 of $(5,108) million represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the nine months ended december 31, 2021 had customer receivables not been previously sold to wcs or third parties in those discontinued programs. the cfoa impact associated with this activity in factoring programs that have now been discontinued was $(5,847) million and $(3,361) million in the year ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, an increase of $(2,487) million. the cfoa impact for the three months ended december 31, 2020 was $(1,377) million. the cfoa impact from receivables factoring and supply chain finance eliminations represents activity related to those internal programs previously facilitated for our industrial segments by our working capital solutions business. we completed the exit from all internal factoring and supply chain finance programs in 2021 and therefore expect no future elimination activity related to these programs.

cash from operating activities was $0.9 billion in 2021, a decrease of $0.1 billion compared with 2020, primarily due to: an increase in financial services-related cash collateral paid net of settlements on derivative contracts of $3.0 billion, which is a standard market practice to minimize derivative counterparty exposures; an increase in cash used for working capital of $1.5 billion; a decrease in employee benefit liabilities (a component of all other operating activities) of $0.3 billion; partially offset by lower ge pension plan contributions (which are excluded from free cash flows*) of $2.5 billion; and an increase in net income (after adjusting for the gain on the sale of biopharma, non-cash losses related to our interest in baker hughes, goodwill impairments, provision for income taxes, non-operating benefit costs and non-operating debt extinguishment costs) primarily due to covid-19 pandemic impacts in our aviation segment in 2020. there was a $0.5 billion and $0.6 billion increase in aviation-related customer allowance accruals in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
we utilized the provision of the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act) which allows employers to defer the payment of social security taxes and, as a result, we deferred $0.3 billion as of december 31, 2020. in accordance with the underlying terms, the company paid 50% of this balance during the fourth quarter of 2021. the remaining 50% is expected to be paid in 2022.
*non-gaap financial measure
2021 form 10-k changes in working capital compared to prior year were as follows: current receivables of $1.1 billion, driven by a lower decrease in sales of receivables to third parties of $0.9 billion; inventories, including deferred inventory, of $(1.8) billion, driven by higher material purchases and lower liquidations; current contract assets of $(0.6) billion, driven by lower net unfavorable changes in estimated profitability at aviation partially offset by the timing of revenue recognition relative to billings and collections on our long-term equipment contracts; accounts payable and equipment project accruals of $0.6 billion, driven by lower disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods; progress collections and current deferred income of $(0.8) billion, driven by higher net liquidations. progress collections and current deferred income included lower early payments received at our aviation military equipment business of $0.3 billion from a foreign government in 2021 compared to $0.7 billion from the u.s. department of defense in 2020.
cash from investing activities was $23.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $4.4 billion compared with 2020, primarily due to: an increase in proceeds of $3.7 billion from the sales of our retained ownership interest in baker hughes; an increase in proceeds of $1.8 billion from business dispositions ($22.4 billion from the combination of our gecas business with aercap in 2021, compared with $20.5 billion from the sale of our biopharma business in 2020); partially offset by the acquisition of bk medical by our healthcare business of $1.5 billion. cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which are components of free cash flows*, was $1.4 billion in 2021, down $0.4 billion compared with 2020. cash received related to net settlements between our continuing operations and businesses in discontinued operations (primarily gecas) was $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is a component of all other investing activities.
cash used for financing activities was $45.3 billion in 2021, an increase of $25.5 billion compared with 2020, primarily due to: higher payments for debt extinguishments of $22.7 billion; higher other net debt maturities of $5.3 billion; lower cash settlements of $0.7 billion on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt partially offset by nonrecurrence of repayments of commercial paper of $3.0 billion in 2020. we paid cash to repurchase long term debt of $39.2 billion and $16.5 billion, including debt extinguishment costs of $7.2 billion and $0.3 billion, excluding a non-cash debt basis adjustment of $0.6 billion and an insignificant amount in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
cash from operating activities was $1.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of $7.8 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: a general decrease in net income (after adjusting for the gain on the sale of biopharma, non-cash losses related to our interest in baker hughes, goodwill impairments, provision for income taxes, non-operating benefit costs, non-operating debt extinguishment costs and a non-cash charge related to our premium deficiency testing in 2019, which is a component of all other operating activities), primarily due to covid-19 impacts in our aviation segment; ge pension plan contributions (which are excluded from free cash flows*) of $2.5 billion; partially offset by increase in financial services-related cash collateral received net of settlements on derivative contracts of $0.6 billion; and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes of $0.5 billion. increases in aviation-related customer allowance accruals (which is a component of all other operating activities) of $0.6 billion were $0.2 billion higher compared with 2019.
we utilized the provision of the cares act which allows employers to defer the payment of social security taxes and, as a result, we deferred $0.3 billion as of december 31, 2020.
changes in working capital compared to prior year were as follows: current receivables of $1.5 billion, driven by lower volume, partially offset by a higher decrease in sales of receivables to third parties of $2.6 billion; inventories, including deferred inventory, of $2.7 billion, primarily driven by lower material purchases, partially offset by lower liquidations; current contract assets of $0.7 billion, primarily due to a net unfavorable change in estimated profitability of $1.2 billion at aviation; accounts payable and equipment project accruals of $(3.3) billion, driven by lower volume in 2020 and higher disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods; progress collections and current deferred income of $(1.7) billion, driven by higher net liquidations. progress collections and current deferred income included early payments received at our aviation military equipment business of $0.7 billion in 2020 as part of the u.s. department of defense's efforts to support vendors in its supply chain during the covid-19 pandemic.
cash from investing activities was $19.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $7.1 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: net proceeds from the sale of our biopharma business in 2020 of $20.5 billion; partially offset by the nonrecurrence of proceeds from the spin-off of our transportation business of $6.2 billion (including the sale of our retained ownership interests in wabtec); lower proceeds from sales of our stake in baker hughes of $2.6 billion (including the sale of a portion of our retained ownership interests in 2020); higher net purchases of equity investments of $1.5 billion and lower cash received related to net settlements between our continuing operations and businesses in discontinued operations of $1.5 billion (both components of all other investing activities); and lower other business dispositions of $1.1 billion. cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment and internal-use software, which are components of free cash flows*, was $1.7 billion in 2020, down $0.8 billion compared with 2019.
cash used for financing activities was $19.8 billion in 2020, an increase of $4.1 billion compared with 2019, primarily due to: higher payments for debt extinguishments of $11.4 billion; a reduction in commercial paper of $3.0 billion; partially offset by an increase in other net debt issuances of $9.4 billion and lower cash settlements of $1.1 billion on derivatives hedging foreign currency debt. we paid cash to repurchase long term debt of $16.5 billion and $5.1 billion, including cash paid for debt extinguishment costs of $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
cash flows from discontinued operations. cash from operating activities in 2021 related primarily to cash generated from earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in our gecas business. cash used for investing activities decreased in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to an increase in net purchases of plant, property and equipment partially offset by an increase in net collections of financing receivables.
*non-gaap financial measure
2021 form 10-k cash from operating activities in 2020 related primarily to cash generated from earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in our gecas business. cash used for investing activities decreased in 2020 compared with 2019 due to the deconsolidation of baker hughes cash as a result of the reduction in our ownership interest in the segment in the third quarter of 2019 partially offset by lower business dispositions.
supply chain finance programs. we facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs with third parties, which provide participating suppliers the opportunity to sell their ge receivables to third parties at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the third parties. at december 31, 2021 and december 31, 2020, included in accounts payable was $3.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, of supplier invoices that are subject to the third-party programs. total supplier invoices paid through these third-party programs were $6.9 billion and $4.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
critical accounting estimates. accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates. see note 1 for further information on our most significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition on long-term services agreements. we have long-term service agreements with our customers predominately within our power and aviation segments that require us to maintain the customers' assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. however, contract modifications that extend or revise contracts are not uncommon. we recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. this requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required maintenance services.
customers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major event within the contract such as an overhaul. as a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. the estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life, impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. customers' asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhauls and other service events over the life of the contract. we generally use a combination of both historical utilization trends as well as forward-looking information such as market conditions and potential asset retirements in developing our revenue estimates.
to develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. in developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.
we routinely review estimates under long-term service agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. these revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. contract modifications that change the rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified contract as a new contract.
we regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination. we gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategies through close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. revisions may affect a long-term services agreement's total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.
on december 31, 2021, our net long-term service agreements balance of $0.6 billion represents approximately 0.3% of our total estimated life of contract billings of $187.4 billion. our contracts (on average) are approximately 19.0% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs. revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements balance by $0.4 billion. billings collected on these contracts were $10.0 billion and $9.6 billion during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. see notes 1 and 8 for further information.
impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible assets. we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter. in assessing the possibility that a reporting unit's fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates, we consider all available evidence, including (i) the results of our impairment testing from the most recent testing date (in particular, the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed), (ii) downward revisions to internal forecasts or decreases in market multiples (and the magnitude thereof), if any, and (iii) declines in market capitalization below book value (and the magnitude and duration of those declines), if any.
we determine fair value for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. we assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. if multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
2021 form 10-k valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. the selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. a market approach is limited to reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have the characteristics similar to our businesses.
under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business. we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. discount rates used in our annual reporting unit valuations ranged from 11.5% to 20.5%.
estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results, internal forecasts, market observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, possible control premiums, determining the appropriate discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the appropriate weighting applied to each approach. it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. determining whether an impairment loss has occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flows and the useful life over which these cash flows will occur. to determine fair value, we use our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate discount rate. see notes 1 and 7 for further information.

pension assumptions. refer to note 12 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.
income taxes. our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. historically u.s. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. due to the enactment of u.s. tax reform, repatriations of available cash from foreign earnings are expected to be free of u.s. federal income tax but may incur withholding or state taxes. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the company. most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-u.s. business operations. at december 31, 2021, we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision as a result of tax reform but we reassess this on an ongoing basis. in december 2021, the company announced plans to form three public companies focused on aviation, healthcare and energy. planning for and execution of this separation will result in tax including potentially tax on changes in indefinite reinvestment outside the u.s. the impact of a change in reinvestment will be recorded when there is a specific change in ability and intent to reinvest earnings.
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which heavily rely on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. amounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-u.s. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. of this, $0.1 billion and $0.3 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our legacy financial services businesses. see other consolidated information - income taxes section and notes 1 and 14 for further information.
loss contingencies. loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, product quality and losses resulting from other events and developments. when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. when there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. see note 22 for further information.
2021 form 10-k other items insurance. the run-off insurance operations of north american life and health (nalh) primarily include employers reassurance corporation (erac) and union fidelity life insurance company (uflic). erac primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. uflic primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from genworth financial inc.(genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. the vast majority of nalh's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though erac and uflic have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. these long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. in many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on long-term care insurance policies.
our run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. the insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from december 31, 2020 to december 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.
in addition to nalh, electric insurance company (eic) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to ge and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
we regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. we believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to covid-19. however, the effects of covid-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. these monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.
key portfolio characteristics long-term care insurance contracts. the long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. for example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.
the erac long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.
the uflic long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.
presented in the table below are gaap and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.

structured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. we reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. these structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-than- average life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.
our life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. as of december 31, 2021, across our u.s. and canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. in 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. the covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. we anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.
investment portfolio and other adjustments. our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our december 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. the portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of december 31, 2021.
in calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. to the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to accumulated other comprehensive income. at december 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. this adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. see note 3 for further information about our investment securities.
we manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. this process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. with the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from changes in the prices of equity instruments). we regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria.
2021 form 10-k our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $31.0 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either erac or uflic as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of erac or uflic which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.
critical accounting estimates. our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.
future policy benefit reserves. future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.
claim reserves. claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.
reinsurance recoverables. we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on long-term care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. these receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption all other assets in our statement of financial position.
premium deficiency testing. we annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. the premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. a comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. the vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. in order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.
morbidity. morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. for long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.
2021 form 10-k rate of change in morbidity. our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimates of projected future changes in the morbidity rates reflected in our base claim cost curves. these estimates draw upon a number of inputs, some of which are subjective, and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristics specific to our portfolios. this exercise of judgment considers factors such as the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial experts engaged to advise us in our annual testing, the observed actual experience in our portfolios measured against our base projections, industry developments, and other trends, including advances in the state of medical care and health-care technology development. with respect to industry developments, we take into account that there are differences between and among industry peers in portfolio characteristics (such as demographic features of the insured populations), the aggregate effect of morbidity improvement or deterioration as applied to base claim cost projections, the extent to which such base cost projections reflect the most current experience, and the accepted diversity of practice in actuarial professional judgment. we assess the potential for any change in morbidity with reference to our existing base claim cost projections, reconstructed in 2017. projected improvement or deterioration in morbidity can have a material impact on our future claim cost projections, both on a stand-alone basis and also by virtue of influencing other variables such as discount rate and premium rate increases.
mortality. mortality assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on published mortality tables as adjusted for the results of our experience studies and estimates of expected future mortality improvement. for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments.
discount rate. interest rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on expected investment yields, net of related investment expenses and expected defaults. in estimating future investment yields, we consider the actual yields on our current investment securities held by our run-off insurance operations and the future rates at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturities, net of other operating cash flows, and the projected future capital contributions into our run-off insurance operations. lower future investment yields result in a lower discount rate and a higher present value of future policy benefit reserves.
future long-term care premium rate increases. long-term care insurance policies allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premiums, or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefits, with approval by state regulators, should actual experience emerge worse than what was projected when such policies were initially underwritten. as a reinsurer, we rely upon the primary insurers that issued the underlying policies to file proposed premium rate increases on those policies with the relevant state insurance regulators. while we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increases, we often collaborate with the primary insurers in accordance with reinsurance contractual terms to file proposed premium rate increases. the amount of times that rate increases have occurred varies by ceding company. we consider recent experience of rate increase filings made by our ceding companies along with state insurance regulatory processes and precedents in establishing our current expectations. higher future premium rate increases lower the present value of future policy benefit reserves and lower future premium rate increases increase the present value of future policy benefit reserves.
terminations. terminations refers to the rate at which the underlying policies are cancelled due to either mortality, lapse (non-payment of premiums by a policyholder), or, in the case of long-term care insurance, benefit exhaustion. termination rate assumptions used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserves are based on the results of our experience studies and reflect actuarial judgment. lower termination rates increase, while higher termination rates decrease, the present value of expected future benefit payments.
in 2017, based on elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance contracts, we initiated a comprehensive review of all premium deficiency testing assumptions across all insurance products, resulting in a reconstruction of our future claim cost projections for long-term care insurance products. while our long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some emerging modest favorable experience, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. however, the extent of actual experience since 2017 to date is limited in the context of a long-tailed, multi-decade portfolio.
2021 premium deficiency testing. we completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2021. these procedures included updating experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2020, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. our 2021 premium deficiency testing started with the positive margin of less than 2% of the recorded future policy benefit reserves that resulted from our 2020 premium deficiency testing. using updated assumptions, the 2021 premium deficiency testing results indicated a significant increase in the positive margin to approximately 11% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at september 30, 2021. as a result, the assumptions updated in connection with the premium deficiency recognized in 2019 remain locked-in and will remain so unless another premium deficiency occurs in the future.
2021 form 10-k the significant increase in the premium deficiency testing margin resulting from our 2021 premium deficiency testing was largely attributable to an increase in the overall discount rate to a weighted average rate of 6.15% compared to 5.70% in 2020 ($2.2 billion). this increase in the discount rate from 2020 reflects further progress of our previously communicated investment portfolio realignment strategy, that includes increased amounts allocated to growth assets, consisting of private equity, equity-like securities and select high yield credit strategies, from our previous target of approximately 8% up to approximately 15%. these amounts are expected to be funded over the next 5 to 7 years from the remaining projected capital contribution of approximately $5.5 billion through 2024 and regular portfolio cash flows while maintaining an overall a-rated fixed income portfolio. the 2021 discount rate assumptions also reflect a lower expected reinvestment rate on fixed-income investments versus that applied in 2020, due to lower prevailing benchmark interest rates in the u.s, grading to a lower expected long-term average investment yield over a shorter period and slightly lower actual yields on our fixed-income investment security portfolio. as a result of this increased allocation to higher-yielding assets, our run-off insurance operations may experience future earnings volatility due to investments carried at fair value with changes in fair values reported in earnings and changes in the allowance for credit losses, and temporary elevated amounts of unfunded investment commitments.
while our observed long-term care insurance claim experience has shown some modest favorable emerging morbidity experience in the period since the 2017 reconstruction of our future claim cost projections, it remains largely in-line with those reconstructed projections. based on the application of professional actuarial judgment to the factors discussed above, we have made no substantial change to our assumptions concerning morbidity, morbidity improvement, mortality, mortality improvement, terminations, or long-term care insurance premium rate increases in 2021. as with all assumptions underlying our premium deficiency testing, we will continue to monitor these factors, which may result in future changes in our assumptions.
since our premium deficiency testing performed in 2020, we have implemented approximately $0.2 billion of previously approved long-term care insurance premium rate increase actions and made no substantial changes to the amount of projected future premium rate increase approvals. our 2021 premium deficiency test includes approximately $1.7 billion of anticipated future premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, of which approximately $0.9 billion has been approved and not yet implemented. this represents a decrease of $0.2 billion from our 2020 premium deficiency test to account for actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030 and includes the effects of the higher discount rate mentioned above and longer anticipated timing to achieve and implement certain premium rate approvals.
as a result of exposure period cut-off dates to permit experience to develop and lags in ceding company data reporting from our ceding companies, the impact of covid-19 was generally not reflected in the experience studies data used in our 2021 premium deficiency testing. however, we assessed certain scenarios to better understand potential impacts associated with covid-19 and, due to the currently observed insignificance and perceived short-term nature of such uncertain future impacts, including the natural offsets from mortality in the aggregate across our run-off insurance products (i.e., for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments), concluded adjustments to our primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency testing were not warranted.
when results of the premium deficiency testing indicate overall reserves are sufficient, we are also required to assess whether additional future policy benefit reserves are required to be accrued over time in the future. such an accrual would be required if profits are projected in earlier future periods followed by losses projected in later future years (i.e., profits followed by losses). when this pattern of profits followed by losses is projected, we would be required to accrue a liability in the expected profitable years by the amount necessary to offset projected losses in later future years. we noted our projections as of third quarter 2021 indicate the present value of projected earnings in each future year to be positive, and therefore, no further adjustments to our future policy benefit reserves were required at this time.
gaap reserve sensitivities. the results of our premium deficiency testing are sensitive to the assumptions described above. considering the results of the 2021 premium deficiency test which resulted in a margin, any future net adverse changes in our assumptions may reduce the margin or result in a premium deficiency requiring an increase to future policy benefit reserves. for example, hypothetical adverse changes in key assumptions related to our future policy benefits reserves, holding all other assumptions constant, would have the following estimated increase to the projected present value of future cash flows as presented in the table below. any future net favorable changes to these assumptions could result in a lower projected present value of future cash flows and additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio, including higher investment income. the assumptions within our future policy benefit reserves are subject to significant uncertainties, including those inherent in the complex nature of our reinsurance treaties. many of our assumptions are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. small changes in the amounts used in the sensitivities, the use of different factors or effect from converting to modeling future cash flow projections for our long-term insurance exposures to a "first principles" model based on more granular assumptions of expected future claim experience could result in materially different outcomes from those reflected below.

statutory considerations. our run-off insurance subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices. statutory accounting practices, not gaap, determine the minimum required statutory capital levels of our insurance legal entities. we annually perform statutory asset adequacy testing and expect our december 31, 2021 testing process to be completed in the first quarter of 2022, the results of which may affect the amount or timing of capital contributions from ge to the insurance legal entities.
statutory accounting practices are set forth by the national association of insurance commissioners (naic) as well as state laws, regulation and general administrative rules and differ in certain respects from gaap. under statutory accounting practices, base formulaic reserve assumptions typically do not change unless approved by our primary regulator, kid. in addition to base reserves, statutory accounting practices require additional actuarial reserves (aar) be established based on results of asset adequacy testing reflecting moderately adverse conditions (i.e., assumptions include a provision for adverse deviation (pad) rather than current assumptions without a pad as required for premium deficiency testing under gaap). as a result, our statutory asset adequacy testing assumptions reflect less long-term care insurance morbidity improvement and for shorter durations, restrictions on future long-term care insurance premium rate increases, no life insurance mortality improvement and a lower discount rate, among other differences. as a result, several of the sensitivities described in the table above would be less impactful on our statutory reserves.
the adverse impact on our statutory aar arising from our revised assumptions in 2017, including the collectability of reinsurance recoverables, is expected to require approximately $14.5 billion of additional capital to our run-off insurance subsidiaries in 2018-2024. for statutory accounting purposes, kid approved our request for a permitted accounting practice to recognize the 2017 aar increase over a seven-year period. capital of $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion were contributed to our run-off insurance subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. we expect to provide further capital contributions of approximately $5.5 billion through 2024 (of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our december 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing), subject to ongoing monitoring by kid. ge is a party to capital maintenance agreements with erac and uflic under which ge is required to maintain their minimum statutory capital levels at 300% of their year-end authorized control level risk-based capital requirements as defined from time to time by the naic.
2021 form 10-k if our future policy benefit reserves established under gaap are realized over the estimated remaining life of our run-off insurance obligations, we would expect the $14.5 billion of capital contributed to the run-off insurance operations over the 2018 to 2024 period to be considered statutory capital surplus at the end of the estimated remaining life with no additional charge to gaap earnings. however, should the more conservative statutory assumptions be realized, we would be required to record the difference between gaap assumptions and statutory assumptions as a charge to gaap earnings in the future periods. see other items - new accounting standards and notes 1 and 11 for further information.
new accounting standards. the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance contracts that is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january 1, 2023, with an election to adopt early, and restatement of prior periods presented. we intend to adopt the new guidance effective january 1, 2023 (with transition adjustments as of january 1, 2021), using the modified retrospective transition method where permitted. we are evaluating the effect of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and anticipate that its adoption will significantly change the accounting for measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities. the new guidance requires cash flow assumptions used in the measurement of various insurance liabilities to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumptions need to be revised with any required changes recorded in earnings. under the current accounting guidance, the discount rate is based on expected investment yields, while under the new guidance the discount rate will be equivalent to the upper-medium grade (i.e., single a) fixed-income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristics of the liability and is required to be updated in each reporting period with changes recorded in other comprehensive income. we expect that the single-a rate under the new guidance at the transition date will be lower than our current discount rate. in measuring the insurance liabilities under the new guidance, contracts shall not be grouped together from different issue years. these changes will result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustments. while we continue to evaluate the effect of the new guidance on our ongoing financial reporting, we anticipate that its adoption will materially affect our financial statements and require changes to certain of our processes, systems, and controls. as the new guidance is only applicable to the measurements of our long-duration insurance liabilities under gaap, it will not affect the accounting for our insurance reserves or the levels of capital and surplus under statutory accounting practices.
non-gaap financial measures. we believe that presenting non-gaap financial measures provides management and investors useful measures to evaluate performance and trends of the total company and its businesses. this includes adjustments in recent periods to gaap financial measures to increase period-to-period comparability following actions to strengthen our overall financial position and how we manage our business. in addition, management recognizes that certain non-gaap terms may be interpreted differently by other companies under different circumstances. in various sections of this report we have made reference to the following non-gaap financial measures in describing our (1) revenues, specifically organic revenues by segment; organic revenues, and equipment and services organic revenues (2) profit, specifically organic profit and profit margin by segment; adjusted profit and profit margin (excluding certain items); adjusted organic profit and profit margin; adjusted earnings (loss); and adjusted earnings (loss) per share (eps). the reasons we use these non-gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures follow.

the service cost for our pension and other benefit plans are included in adjusted earnings*, which represents the ongoing cost of providing pension benefits to our employees. the components of non-operating benefit costs are mainly driven by capital allocation decisions and market performance. we believe the retained costs in adjusted earnings* and adjusted eps* provides management and investors a useful measure to evaluate the performance of the total company and increases period-to-period comparability. we also use adjusted eps* as a performance metric at the company level for our annual executive incentive plan for 2021.

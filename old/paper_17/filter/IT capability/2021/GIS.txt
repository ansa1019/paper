item 1a - risk factors our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
business and industry risks global health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the covid-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
the public health crisis caused by the covid-19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments, businesses, including us, and the public at large to limit covid-19's spread have had, and we expect will continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of operations including, without limitation, the following:
 we have experienced, and may continue to experience, a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the world that have been affected by the covid-19 pandemic. in particular, sales of our products in the away-from-home food outlets across all our major markets have been negatively affected by reduced consumer traffic resulting from shelter-in-place regulations or recommendations and closings of restaurants, schools and cafeterias. if the covid-19 pandemic persists or intensifies, its negative impacts on our sales, particularly in away-from-home food outlets, could be more prolonged and may become more severe.
 deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets affected by the covid-19 pandemic, such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could cause a decrease in demand for our products.
 we have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. we have implemented employee safety measures, based on guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention and world health organization, across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use, and temperature screenings. these measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid-19 among our employees. illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. we may face additional production disruptions in the future, which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs.
 changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in subsequent quarters. short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain.
 the failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations.
 significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell, or distribute our products (including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees' ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, and sale of our products) could adversely impact our operations and results.
 actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the covid-19 pandemic may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us.
the categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
the consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. all of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. in most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. if our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. if we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. if we are unable to build and sustain
brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products.
we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.
there has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. in addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. if we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers' needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. in addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. in fiscal 2021, walmart accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 29 percent of net sales of our north america retail segment. for more information on significant customers, please see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability.
the principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics (such as the covid-19 pandemic), and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile during the covid-19 pandemic. commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, energy, and transportation costs. if we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.
concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers to avoid certain products or ingredients.
we could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products or ingredients. adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.
we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products.
our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. if we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain-free or legume-rich pet food, or other product ingredients or attributes.
we may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories.
the food industry's growth potential is constrained by population growth. our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. one way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. if we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.
our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.
maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. the value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. the use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and
opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted.
operating risks if we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate.
our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. we periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. if we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.
our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics (such as the covid-19 pandemic), governmental restrictions or mandates, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single supplier. the failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. our suppliers' policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.
short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.
in fiscal 2021, 26 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the united states. we are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. these risks include:
 political and economic instability;
 exchange controls and currency exchange rates;
 nationalization or government control of operations;
 compliance with anti-corruption regulations;
 uncertainty relating to the impact of the united kingdom's exit from the european union;
 foreign tax treaties and policies; and
 restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.
our financial performance on a u.s. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. these fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. our principal exposures are to the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese renminbi, euro, japanese yen, mexican peso, and swiss franc. from time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.
a strengthening in the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate, such as has generally occurred during the covid-19 pandemic to-date, would negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses.
our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.
information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. these technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business.
our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.
from time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. if we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.
legal and regulatory risks if our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured.
we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. a widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.
new regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.
our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the united states department of agriculture, the federal food and drug administration, the occupational safety and health administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees. our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. we may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed. changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.
significant covid-19 related changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products (including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees' ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products) could adversely impact our operations and results.
we are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. we are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and
compliance costs to differ from our estimates. we cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
financial and economic risks volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.
we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. these gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. we also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.
economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.
the willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. in those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. in addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our convenience stores & foodservice segment. any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.
as of may 30, 2021, we had total debt, redeemable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $13.5 billion. the agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. our level of indebtedness may limit our:
 ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and
 flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.
there are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. if we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.
our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.
global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.
we depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. although we believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. we also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. if we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.
the covid-19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets. we may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. a disruption in the financial markets may have a
negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts.
from time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (ibors) and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an ibor. there is currently uncertainty whether certain ibors will continue to be available after 2021. if certain ibors cease to be available, we may need to amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders. as a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.
volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.
we sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the united states, canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.
a change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.
as of may 30, 2021, we had $20.7 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. we compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. we also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. if current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly impaired. our europe & australia reporting unit had experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor this business. while we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.
we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the blue buffalo, pillsbury, totino's, progresso, yoplait, old el paso, yoki, häagen-dazs, and annie's brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. if current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, then our indefinite-lived intangible assets could become significantly impaired. our progresso, green giant, and epic brands had experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor these businesses.
for further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a global packaged foods company. we develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. we work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers' evolving needs and preferences. in addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. we believe our brand-building approach is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe.
our fundamental financial goal is to generate competitively differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term. we believe achieving that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth, margin expansion, cash conversion, and cash return to shareholders over time.
our long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time:
 mid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;
 mid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share (eps);
we are executing our accelerate strategy to drive sustainable, profitable growth and top-tier shareholder returns over the long term. the strategy focuses on four pillars to create competitive advantages and win: boldly building brands, relentlessly innovating, unleashing our scale, and being a force for good. we are prioritizing our core markets, global platforms, and local gem brands that have the best prospects for profitable growth and we are committed to reshaping our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further enhance our growth profile.
we expect that changes in consumer behaviors driven by the covid-19 pandemic will result in ongoing elevated consumer demand for food at home, relative to pre-pandemic levels. these changes include more time spent working from home and increased consumer appreciation for cooking and baking. we plan to capitalize on these opportunities, addressing evolving consumer needs through our leading brands, innovation, and advantaged capabilities to generate profitable growth.
in fiscal 2021, we executed well amid the uncertain environment caused by the pandemic, delivering strong growth in organic net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted eps. we achieved each of the three priorities we established at the beginning of the year:
we competed effectively, everywhere we play, highlighted by market share gains across each of our five global platforms: cereal, pet food, ice cream, snack bars, and mexican food. our positive market share performance amid pandemic-driven elevated demand for food at home helped drive organic net sales growth in our north america retail, europe & australia, and asia & latin america segments. conversely, lower away-from-home food demand stemming from the pandemic resulted in a decline in organic net sales for our convenience stores & foodservice segment. for our pet segment, which was largely unaffected by the pandemic, we were able to generate organic net sales growth despite the comparison against an extra month of results in the prior year.
we drove efficiency to fuel investment in our brands and capabilities. we generated strong levels of holistic margin management (hmm) cost savings and were able to meaningfully increase our investment in brand building activities and in strategic capabilities such as e-commerce, digital, data & analytics, and strategic revenue management.
we reduced our debt leverage and increased our financial flexibility. as a result of our continued cash discipline, we were able to reduce our debt and generate a reduction in our leverage ratio. due to our improved balance sheet position, we were able to resume dividend growth and share repurchase activity during fiscal 2021.
we also announced important transactions during fiscal 2021 intended to reshape our portfolio for growth, in line with our accelerate strategy. in march 2021, we announced the proposed sale of our european yoplait operations to sodiaal, in exchange for full ownership of the canadian yoplait business and a reduced royalty rate for the use of the yoplait and liberté brands in the united states and canada. the proposed transaction would be anticipated to close by the end of calendar 2021, subject to appropriate labor consultations, regulatory filings, and other customary closing conditions. in may 2021, we reached a definitive agreement to acquire tyson foods' pet treats business for $1.2 billion in cash. the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2021 rose 3 percent to $18.1 billion. on an organic basis, net sales increased 4 percent compared to year-ago levels. operating profit of $3.1 billion increased 6 percent. adjusted operating profit of $3.2 billion increased 2 percent on a constant-currency basis. diluted eps of $3.78 was up 6 percent compared to fiscal 2020 results. adjusted diluted eps of $3.79 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the "non-gaap measures" section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (gaap)).
net cash provided by operations totaled $3.0 billion in fiscal 2021 representing a conversion rate of 127 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. this cash generation supported capital investments totaling $531 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2.4 billion at a conversion rate of 103 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. we returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.2 billion and share repurchases totaling $301 million, and we reduced total debt outstanding by $928 million. our ratio of net debt-to-operating cash flow was 3.7 in fiscal 2021, and our net debt-to-adjusted earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (net debt-to-adjusted ebitda) ratio was 2.9 (see the "non-gaap measures" section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap).
a detailed review of our fiscal 2021 performance compared to fiscal 2020 appears below in the section titled "fiscal 2021 consolidated results of operations." a detailed review of our fiscal 2020 performance compared to our fiscal 2019 performance is set forth in part ii, item 7 of our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended may 31, 2020 under the caption "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - fiscal 2020 results of consolidated operations," which is incorporated herein by reference.
in fiscal 2022, we expect to continue to compete effectively in a dynamic environment, work aggressively to navigate a turbulent cost environment, and successfully execute our portfolio and organization reshaping actions. we expect the largest factors impacting our performance will be the relative balance of at-home versus away-from-home consumer food demand and the inflationary cost environment, both of which remain uncertain. we expect at-home food demand will decline year over year across most of our core markets, though will remain above pre-pandemic levels. conversely, we expect away-from-home food demand to continue to recover, though not fully to pre-pandemic levels. with roughly 85 percent of our net sales representing at-home food occasions, we expect these dynamics to result in lower aggregate consumer demand in our categories in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 levels.
total input cost inflation is expected to be approximately 7 percent of cost of goods sold in fiscal 2022. we are addressing the inflationary environment with strong hmm cost savings expected to total roughly 4 percent of cost of goods sold and with positive net price realization generated through our strategic revenue management capability.
 organic net sales are expected to decline 1 to 3 percent, which is generally in line with the expected level of aggregate category demand in fiscal 2022.
 constant-currency adjusted operating profit is expected to decline 2 to 4 percent from the base of $3.2 billion reported in fiscal 2021.
 relative to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2019, the midpoints of these fiscal 2022 guidance ranges equate to 3-year compound annual growth rates of approximately 2 percent for organic net sales, approximately 2 percent for constant-currency adjusted operating profit, and approximately 5 percent for constant-currency adjusted diluted eps.
see the "non-gaap measures" section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by gaap.
certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in item 8 of this report.
fiscal 2021 consolidated results of operations fiscal 2021 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2020. fiscal 2020 included 13 months of pet operating segment results as we changed the pet operating segment's reporting period from an april fiscal year end to a may fiscal year end to match our fiscal calendar.
in fiscal 2021, net sales increased 3 percent compared to fiscal 2020 and organic net sales increased 4 percent compared to last year. operating profit margin of 17.3 percent was up 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by favorable net price realization and mix, a favorable change to the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, and favorable net corporate investment activity, partially offset by higher input costs, higher restructuring charges, and the loss on the sale of our

we strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. for fiscal 2021, core working capital increased 6 percent, compared to a net sales increase of 3 percent. as of may 30, 2021, our core working capital balance was a net liability of $194 million compared to a net liability of $206 million in fiscal 2020. the $12 million change was primarily due to lower inventory balances in fiscal 2020 driven by the surge in at-home demand at the outset of the pandemic, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable in fiscal 2021 due to increased costs incurred to service demand. in fiscal 2020, core working capital decreased $591 million, compared to a net sales increase of 5 percent.

to ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines and have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe. in response to uncertainty surrounding the availability and cost of commercial paper borrowings as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we issued $750 million of fixed-rate notes in april 2020 and reduced our borrowings under commercial paper programs. as the covid-19 pandemic evolves, we will continue to evaluate its impact to our sources of liquidity. we also have uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign operations.
we have material contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business and we believe that cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. as of may 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.
we have $2,464 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including €200 million of 2.2 percent fixed-rate notes due june 2021, €500 million of 0.0 percent fixed-rate notes due august 2021, €500 million of 0.0 percent fixed-rate notes due november 2021, and $1 billion of 3.15 percent fixed-rate notes due december 2021. we believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.
our net debt to operating cash flow ratio increased to 3.7 in fiscal 2021 from 3.2 in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by a decrease in cash provided by operations. our net debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio declined to 2.9 in fiscal 2021 from 3.2 in fiscal 2020 (see the "non-gaap measures" section below for our use of this measure not defined by gaap).
we have a 51 percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl. sodiaal international (sodiaal) holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. we consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. we record sodiaal's 50 percent interest in yoplait marques snc and liberté marques sàrl as noncontrolling interests, and its 49 percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets. these euro- and canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in u.s. dollars on our consolidated balance sheets. sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before december 2024. as of may 30, 2021, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $605 million which approximates its fair value.
in march 2021, we entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding to sell our 51 percent controlling interest in our european yoplait business to sodiaal. as part of the proposed transaction, we would obtain sodiaal's 49 percent ownership interest in our canadian yogurt business, making the canadian yogurt business a wholly owned subsidiary. the proposed transaction would be anticipated to close in fiscal 2022, subject to labor consultations, regulatory filings, and other customary closing conditions.
the third-party holder of the general mills cereals, llc (gmc) class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder's capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). on june 1, 2021, the floating preferred return rate on gmc's class a interests was reset to the sum of three-month libor plus 160 basis points. the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction.
we have an option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. if we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder's capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period.
critical accounting estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies, please see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. our critical accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. these estimates include our accounting for revenue recognition, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.
considerations related to the covid-19 pandemic the continuing impact that the recent covid-19 pandemic will have on our consolidated results of operations is uncertain. we saw increased orders from retail customers across all geographies in response to increased consumer demand for food at home. we also experienced a covid-19-related decrease in consumer traffic in away-from-home food outlets. in fiscal 2022, we expect at-home food demand will decline year over year across most of our core markets though will remain above pre-pandemic levels. conversely, we expect away-from home food demand to continue to recover, though not fully to pre-pandemic levels. we expect one of the largest factors impacting our performance will be relative balance of at-home versus away-from-home consumer food demand, primarily driven by the level of virus control in markets around the world, which remains uncertain. we have considered the potential impacts of the covid-19 pandemic in our significant accounting estimates as of may 30, 2021, and will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business and consolidated results of operations.
revenue recognition our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption and other reductions to the transaction price, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. differences between the estimated and actual reduction to the transaction price are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. our accrued trade and coupon promotion liabilities were $508 million as of may 30, 2021, and $471 million as of may 31, 2020. because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations.
valuation of long-lived assets we estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.
intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. we use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. we also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.
we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.
as of may 30, 2021, we had $21 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. we performed our fiscal 2021 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and we determined there was no impairment of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values.
while having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2021 assessment date, the europe & australia reporting unit and the progresso, green giant, and epic brand intangible assets had risk of decreasing coverage. we will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.
redeemable interest the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value of the redeemable interest include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. as of may 30, 2021, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $605 million.
stock-based compensation the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. for more information on these assumptions, please see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the black-scholes option-pricing model were as follows:
estimated fair values of stock options granted     $8.03                 $7.10                 $5.35
expected term                                        8.5   years           8.5   years           8.5   years expected volatility                                 19.5       %          17.4       %          16.3       %
the risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the u.s. treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. an increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent. if all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2021 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2021 option awards by 7 percent.
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense.
any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating cash flow. the actual impact on future years' cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes.
realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings. because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.
income taxes we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change. for more information on income taxes, please see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the united states, canada, switzerland, france, and the united kingdom. we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the united states, canada, and brazil. under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the united states, canada, and mexico. please see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.
we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants' active working lives. accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net
periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates.
expected rate of return on plan assets our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. we review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.
our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 11.4 percent, 10.8 percent, 9.3 percent, 8.0 percent, and 8.3 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended may 30, 2021.
on a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 5.72 percent for fiscal 2021, 6.95 percent for fiscal 2020, and 7.25 percent for fiscal 2019. for fiscal 2022, we increased our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to 5.96 percent due to expected long-term asset returns.
lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $72 million for fiscal 2022. a market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. the market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income.
discount rates we estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our united states and most of our international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of may 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the aa above median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2022 by approximately $54 million. all obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as "all or almost all" inactive participants.
health care cost trend rates we review our health care cost trend rates annually. our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. this information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience
and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.3 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.0 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2021. rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees' benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.
any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as "all or almost all" inactive participants.
financial statement impact in fiscal 2021, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $4 million compared to $2 million of income in fiscal 2020 and $24 million of expense in fiscal 2019. as of may 30, 2021, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative unrecognized actuarial net gains of $179 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets. these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap.
actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans.
recently issued accounting pronouncements in march 2020, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued optional accounting guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. the new standard provides expedients and exceptions to existing accounting requirements for contract modifications and hedge accounting related to transitioning from discontinued reference rates, such as libor, to alternative reference rates, if certain criteria are met. the new accounting requirements can be applied as of the beginning of the interim period including march 12, 2020, or any date thereafter, through december 31, 2022. we are in the process of reviewing our contracts and arrangements that will be affected by a discontinued reference rate and are analyzing the impact of this guidance on our results of operations and financial position.
non-gaap measures we have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by gaap. we believe that these measures provide useful information to investors and include these measures in other communications to investors.
for each of these non-gaap financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure, an explanation of why we believe the non-gaap measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional material purposes for which our management or board of directors uses the non-gaap measure. these non-gaap measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable gaap measure.
several measures below are presented on an adjusted basis. the adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management's judgment, significantly affect the year-to-year assessment of operating results.
organic net sales growth rates we provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. this measure is used in reporting to our board of directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. we believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53rd week, when applicable, have on year-to-year comparability. a reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant gaap measures, are included in our consolidated results of operations and results of segment operations discussions in the md&a above.
adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis this measure is used in reporting to our board of directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. we believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the operating profit measure we use to evaluate operating profit performance on a comparable year-to-year basis. additionally, the measure is evaluated on a constant-currency basis by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
our adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows:
2021          2020   change operating profit as reported                                           $3,144.8      $2,953.9   6     %

percentage change in operating profit as reported     impact of foreign currency exchange     percentage change in operating profit on constant-currency basis north america retail                        flat                                                  flat                                    flat europe &amp; australia                      33                         %                          9                   pts                 24                                 %
forward-looking financial measures our fiscal 2022 outlook for organic net sales growth, constant-currency adjusted operating profit, adjusted diluted eps, and free cash flow are non-gaap financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring charges and project-related costs, acquisition transaction and integration costs, acquisitions, divestitures, and mark-to-market effects. we are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking gaap financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing or impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2022. the unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2022 gaap financial results.
for fiscal 2022, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions) and divestitures completed prior to fiscal 2022 to have an immaterial impact on net sales growth; foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted eps growth; and restructuring charges and project-related costs related to actions previously announced to total approximately $10 million to $60 million. our fiscal 2022 guidance does not incorporate the potential impacts of any acquisitions and divestitures that have not yet been completed.

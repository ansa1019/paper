item 1a. risk factors.
our operations are affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. in evaluating investment in the company and the forward-looking information contained in this annual report on form 10-k or presented elsewhere from time to time, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below. any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. the risks described below are not all inclusive but are designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. in addition to such risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.
risks related to economic conditions the covid-19 global pandemic may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the covid-19 global pandemic, including resurgences and variants of the virus that causes covid-19, and efforts to reduce its spread have led, and may continue to lead to, significant changes in levels of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets. these factors have led, and may continue to lead, to reduced demand for industrial gas products, particularly in our merchant business. in addition, covid-19 may result in reduced sales in our other businesses, lower returns for certain of our projects, and the potential delay or cancellation of certain projects in our pipeline.
in addition, we are monitoring the health of our employees and many of our employees, including those based at our headquarters, are working remotely in accordance with health safety guidance and applicable governmental orders. action by health or other governmental authorities requiring the closure of our facilities, recommending other physical distancing measures, or mandating vaccination against covid-19 could negatively impact our business and those of our service providers and customers. although we have business continuity and other safeguards in place, we cannot be certain that they will be fully effective for extended periods of time.
table of contents as the pandemic and responses to it continue to evolve we may experience further adverse impacts on our operations, and our ability to access capital on favorable terms, or at all, may be impaired. in addition, we may face unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products when restrictions on business and travel end. if demand for our products exceeds our capacity, it could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships. although the duration and ultimate impact of these factors is unknown at this time, the decline in economic conditions due to covid-19, or another disease-causing similar impacts, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and such impact may be material.
further, to the extent covid-19 adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.
changes in global and regional economic conditions, the markets we serve, or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies, the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash flows.
demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past, including most recently due to covid-19, and may do so in the future. reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings. in addition, reduced demand could depress sales, reduce our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits.
in addition, our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment. a decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated contract terminations, project delays or the inability to recover plant investments, any of which may negatively impact our financial results.
weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or otherwise make us unable to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming on-stream when expected. these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market, product, or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.
our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal, and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability.
in fiscal year 2021, over 60% of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states and many of our operations, suppliers, and employees are located outside the united states. our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations, import and trade restrictions, trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting u.s. companies doing business abroad. changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, strained relations between countries, or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
table of contents our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states, particularly in markets such as china, india, indonesia, and the middle east, and involve significantly larger and more complex projects, including gasification and large-scale hydrogen projects, some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. we are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources, in some cases through joint ventures, in developing markets, which we believe to have high growth potential. our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. in addition, our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation, respectively, without full compensation for loss. successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time.
furthermore, because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the united states, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. we choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' earnings into dollars. accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see item 7a, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, below.
risks related to our business operational and project execution risks, particularly with respect to our largest projects, may adversely affect our operations or financial results.
a significant and growing portion of our business involves gasification and other large-scale projects that involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may last up to several years and involve the investment of billions of dollars. these projects are technically complex, often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities and face significant financing, development, operational and reputational risks. we may encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and materials delivery delays, schedule changes, customer scope changes, delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rights-of-way, inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants, weather-related delays, delays by customers' contractors in completing their portion of a project, technical or transportation difficulties, cost overruns, supply difficulties, geopolitical risks and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule. in some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. we may not be able to recover any of these costs. in addition, in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing. these financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which, if not met, could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses. all of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties, any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future.
the operation of our facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, vehicle accidents, or cyber incidents. if operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flows. in addition, our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements, which depend, in part, on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets.
table of contents we are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. regulations addressing, among other things, import/export restrictions, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
we are subject to government regulation in the united states and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business. the application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear. compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability. if there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results. compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional, unplanned capital expenditures. export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses. increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirements, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the united kingdom bribery act and the china anti-unfair competition law, could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred. in addition, we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the u.s. and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us, or certain of our affiliates, from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct. such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities.
further, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy. any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. in addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.
we may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, or effectively disentangle divested businesses.
our ability to grow revenue, earnings, and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify, successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices, and realize expected growth, synergies, and operating efficiencies. we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. in addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses, the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance. in addition, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations.
we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. for example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all. in addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes with buyers. in addition, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities. our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions.
table of contents the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.
we depend on information technology to enable us to operate safely and efficiently and interface with our customers as well as to maintain our internal control environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency. our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, property damage, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach. in addition, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, and may subject us to legal liability.
as with most large systems, our information technology systems have in the past been, and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. to date, we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could: interrupt our operations at one or more sites; delay production and shipments; result in the theft of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets; damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation; result in defective products or services, physical damage to facilities, pipelines or delivery systems, including those we own or operate for third parties, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws, or increased costs for security and remediation; or raise concerns regarding our internal control environment and internal control over financial reporting. each of these consequences could adversely affect our business, reputation and our financial statements.
our business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our employees, vendors, and customers. the protection of such information, as well as our proprietary information, is critical to us. the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. we also, from time to time, export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states. breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability. these events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.
interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.
hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of our business. because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, inflation and energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings. a disruption in the supply of energy, components, or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, the covid-19 pandemic, natural events, or other disruption, could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results.
table of contents we typically contract to pass-through cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers, but such cost pass-through results in declining margins, and cost variability can negatively impact our other operating results. for example, we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs. in addition, increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings. even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.
we are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings. existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base. these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. failure of the technologies to work as predicted, or unintended consequences of new designs or uses, could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or damage to our reputation. in addition, gasification and other large-scale projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination, and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others, such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations. additionally, there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and replaced by other market alternatives. performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. in addition, performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts for gasification projects.
protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights.
as we develop new technologies, it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against third-party infringement. we own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services. as we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted, or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests. we may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against third-party infringement. it is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm.
we are the world's leading supplier of hydrogen, the primary use of which is the production of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health. to make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers, we use steam methane reforming, which produces carbon dioxide. in addition, gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and value-added products; however, our gasification projects also produce carbon dioxide. some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing ghg emissions, including co2, which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations. furthermore, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs.
increased public concern and governmental action may result in more international, u.s. federal and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg emissions. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.
table of contents our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.
we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. while we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable. also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular period.
costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.
we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products. future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. in addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. these additional costs may adversely affect our financial results. for a more detailed description of these matters, see item 1, business-environmental regulation, above.
the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.
changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. various levels of government, including the u.s. federal government, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. further changes in tax laws in the u.s. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, and terrorism. any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to third-party liability claims. additionally, such events could impact our suppliers, customers, and partners, which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us, or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results.
table of contents the united kingdom's ("uk") exit from european union ("eu") membership could adversely affect our european operations.
although the uk's exit from eu membership on 31 january 2021 ("brexit") did not result in material disruptions to customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, or our european business, the ultimate effects of brexit on us are still difficult to predict. adverse consequences from brexit may include greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu members and increased regulatory complexities. any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our european business overall.
inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.
we face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments. introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for, or impact pricing of our products, negatively impacting financial results. in addition, competitors' pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share.

business overview air products and chemicals, inc., a delaware corporation originally founded in 1940, serves customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, equipment, and services. focused on serving energy, environment and emerging markets, we provide essential industrial gases, related equipment, and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. we are the world's largest supplier of hydrogen and have built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and liquefied natural gas ("lng") process technology and equipment. we develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world's largest industrial gas projects, including gasification projects that sustainably convert abundant natural resources into syngas for the production of high-value power, fuels, and chemicals and are developing carbon capture projects and world-scale low carbon and carbon-free hydrogen projects that will support global transportation and the energy transition away from fossil fuels.
table of contents with operations in over 50 countries, in fiscal year 2021 we had sales of $10.3 billion and assets of $26.9 billion. approximately 20,875 passionate, talented, and committed employees from diverse backgrounds are driven by our higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability, and address the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world.
•corporate and other this management's discussion and analysis discusses our results based on these operations. refer to note 23, business segment and geographic information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.
on 4 november 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments effective 1 october 2021. refer to note 24, subsequent events, for additional information.
2021 in summary in fiscal year 2021, we continued to execute our growth strategy, including announcement of several new gasification, carbon capture, and hydrogen projects that will drive the world's energy transition from fossil fuels. at the same time, we remained focused on our base business, delivering consistent results despite external challenges globally and absorbing costs for additional resources needed to support growth. in the second half of the year, demand for most merchant products returned to pre-pandemic levels. additionally, we continued to create shareholder value by increasing the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.50 per share, representing a 12% increase from the previous dividend. this is the 39th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.
•sales of $10.3 billion increased 17%, or $1.5 billion, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, higher volumes, favorable currency impacts, and positive pricing that more than offset power cost increases in the second half of the year.
•adjusted ebitda of $3,883.2 increased 7%, or $263.4, and adjusted ebitda margin of 37.6% decreased 330 bp.

2022 outlook the guidance below should be read in conjunction with the forward-looking statements of this annual report on form 10-k.
we believe our achievements in 2021 are just the beginning of our journey providing gasification, carbon capture, and hydrogen for mobility solutions to address the world's most significant energy and environmental sustainability challenges. for example, we expect our world-scale jazan gasification project with aramco, acwa power, and air products qudra to begin contributing to our results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. we expect to continue to pursue new, high-return opportunities that are aligned with our growth strategy and to add the resources necessary for project development and execution. we remain committed to creating shareholder value through capital deployment and delivering increased dividends, as we have done for the past 39 consecutive years.
the duration and extent of ongoing global challenges, such as rising energy costs, energy consumption curtailment, and supply chain disruptions, remain uncertain. for our merchant business, we plan to continue pricing actions to recover higher energy costs. we expect to add new projects to our onsite business model, which has contractual protection from energy cost fluctuations and generates stable cash flow. we expect higher costs from planned maintenance activities on our facilities in fiscal year 2022 and higher pension expense resulting from lower expected returns on assets.
additionally, we expect the lu'an facility to continue operating under the interim agreement discussed below through fiscal year 2022.
in fiscal year 2022, we will also continue to focus on our other sustainability goals, including our commitment to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions intensity and advance diversity and inclusion.
on 4 november 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments, including the separation of our industrial gases - emea segment into two separate reporting segments: industrial gases - europe and industrial gases - middle east. the results of an affiliate formerly reflected in the industrial gases - asia segment will now be reported in the industrial gases - middle east segment. additionally, the results of our industrial gases - global operating segment will be reflected in the corporate and other segment. beginning with our quarterly report on form 10-q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, segment results will be presented on a retrospective basis to reflect the reorganization.

table of contents sales of $10,323.0 increased 17%, or $1,466.7, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 6%, higher volumes of 5%, favorable currency impacts of 4%, and positive pricing of 2%. we experienced significantly higher energy and natural gas costs in the second half of fiscal year 2021, particularly in north america and europe. contractual provisions associated with our on-site business, which represents approximately half our total company sales, allow us to pass these costs to our customers. positive volumes from new assets, our sale of equipment businesses, and merchant demand recovery from covid-19 were partially offset by reduced contributions from the lu'an gasification project discussed below. favorable currency was primarily driven by the appreciation of the british pound sterling, chinese renminbi, euro, and south korean won against the u.s. dollar. continued focus on pricing actions, including energy cost recovery, in our merchant businesses resulted in price improvement in each of our three regional segments.
lu'an clean energy company ("lu'an"), a long-term onsite customer in asia with which we have a consolidated joint venture, restarted its facility in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 following successful completion of major maintenance work in september 2020. our facility resumed operations, and the joint venture is supplying product at reduced charges as agreed upon with lu'an under a short-term agreement reached in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. as a result of this agreement, we recognized lower revenue in our industrial gases - asia segment in each quarter of fiscal year 2021. we expect this short-term reduction in charges to extend through fiscal year 2022.
cost of sales and gross margin total cost of sales of $7,209.3, including the facility closure discussed below, increased 23%, or $1,351.2. the increase from the prior year was primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of $479, higher costs associated with sales volumes of $433, unfavorable currency impacts of $233, and higher costs, including power and other cost inflation, of $183. gross margin of 30.2% decreased 370 bp from 33.9% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, higher costs, and the reduced lu'an contribution, partially offset by the positive impact of our pricing actions.
facility closure in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recorded a charge of $23.2 ($17.4 after-tax, or $0.08 per share) primarily for a noncash write-down of assets associated with a contract termination in the industrial gases - americas segment. this charge is reflected as "facility closure" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021 and was not recorded in segment results.
gain on exchange with joint venture partner in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recognized a gain of $36.8 ($27.3 after-tax, or $0.12 per share) on an exchange with the tyczka group, a former joint venture partner in our industrial gases - emea segment. as part of the exchange, we separated our 50/50 joint venture in germany into two separate businesses so each party could acquire a portion of the business on a 100% basis. the gain included $12.7 from the revaluation of our previously held equity interest in the portion of the business that we retained and $24.1 from the sale of our equity interest in the remaining business. the gain is reflected as "gain on exchange with joint venture partner" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021 and was not recorded in segment results. refer to note 3, acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
table of contents other income (expense), net other income of $52.8 decreased 19%, or $12.6. the prior year was favorably impacted by an adjustment for a benefit plan liability due to a change in plan terms. this impact was partially offset by the settlement of a supply contract in the current year.
operating income and margin operating income of $2,281.4 increased 2%, or $43.8, as favorable currency of $96, positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $95, and a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner of $37 were partially offset by higher operating costs of $127, prior year income associated with the company headquarters relocation of $34, and a facility closure of $23. despite higher sales volumes, the volume impact on operating income was minimal due to reduced contributions from lu'an. unfavorable operating costs were driven by the addition of resources to support our growth strategy and higher planned maintenance activities.
operating margin of 22.1% decreased 320 bp from 25.3% in the prior year, primarily due to the higher operating costs, higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which contributed to sales but not operating income, and reduced contributions from lu'an, partially offset by positive pricing. the positive impact from a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner in the current year was offset by prior year income associated with the company headquarters relocation.
equity affiliates' income equity affiliates' income of $294.1 increased 11%, or $29.3. higher income from affiliates in the regional segments was partially offset by a prior year benefit of $33.8 from the enactment of the india finance act 2020. refer to note 21, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we expect our equity affiliates' income to grow in future periods due to our investment in the jazan integrated gasification and power company joint venture.
less: capitalized interest                           28.3            15.9
interest incurred increased 36%, or $44.9, primarily driven by a higher debt balance due to the issuance of u.s. dollar- and euro-denominated fixed-rate notes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. capitalized interest increased $12.4 due to a higher carrying value of projects under construction.
other non-operating income (expense), net other non-operating income of $73.7 increased $43.0. we recorded higher non-service pension income in 2021 due to lower interest costs and higher total assets, primarily for our u.s. pension plans. the current year also included favorable currency impacts. these factors were partially offset by lower interest income on cash and cash items due to lower interest rates.
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $70.3 ($0.32 per share) for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021. this included net tax benefits of $60.0 recorded for the release of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, of which $51.8 ($0.23 per share) was recorded in the fourth quarter for liabilities associated with the 2017 sale of our former performance materials division ("pmd") and $8.2 was recorded in the third quarter for liabilities associated with our former energy-from-waste business. additionally, we recorded a tax benefit from discontinued operations of $10.3 in the first quarter, primarily from the settlement of a state tax appeal related to the gain on the sale of pmd.
in fiscal year 2020, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $14.3 ($0.06 per share). this resulted from a pre-tax loss of $19.0 recorded in the second quarter to increase our existing liability for retained environmental obligations associated with the sale of our former amines business in september 2006. refer to the pace discussion within note 16, commitments and contingencies, for additional information.
table of contents net income and net income margin net income of $2,114.9, including income from discontinued operations discussed above, increased 10%, or $183.8. on a continuing operations basis, the increase was primarily driven by positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, favorable currency impacts, higher equity affiliates' income, and a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner, partially offset by unfavorable operating costs and a loss from a facility closure. in addition, less net income was attributable to noncontrolling interests, including our lu'an joint venture partner, in the current year. the prior year included income associated with the company headquarters relocation and a net benefit from the india finance act 2020.
adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda of $3,883.2 increased 7%, or $263.4, primarily due to favorable currency impacts, positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, and higher equity affiliates' income, partially offset by unfavorable operating costs. adjusted ebitda margin of 37.6% decreased 330 bp from 40.9% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which decreased margin by approximately 200 bp, and the unfavorable net operating costs.
effective tax rate our effective tax rate was 18.5% and 19.7% for the fiscal years ended 30 september 2021 and 2020, respectively. the current year rate was lower primarily due to income tax benefits of $21.5 recorded upon expiration of the statute of limitations for tax reserves previously established for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years. this included a benefit of $12.2 ($0.05 per share) for release of reserves established in 2017 for a tax election related to a non-u.s. subsidiary and other previously disclosed items ("tax election benefit and other"). refer to note 21 income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
additionally, the fiscal year 2020 effective tax rate reflected the unfavorable impact of india finance act 2020, which resulted in additional net income of $13.5 ($0.06 per share). this included an increase to equity affiliates' income of $33.8, partially offset by an increase to our income tax provision of $20.3 for changes in the future tax costs of repatriated earnings.

table of contents sales of $4,167.6 increased 15%, or $536.9, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 11% and positive pricing of 4%, as volumes and currency were flat versus the prior year. energy and natural gas cost pass through to customers was higher in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to natural gas prices, which rose significantly in the second quarter and remained elevated throughout the year. the pricing improvement was attributable to continued focus on pricing actions in our merchant business. volumes were flat as positive contributions from new assets, including hydrogen assets we acquired in april 2020, were offset by lower hydrogen and merchant demand. demand for most merchant products returned to pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2021.
equity affiliates' income of $112.5 increased 33%, or $28.2, primarily driven by higher income from affiliates in mexico.

sales of $2,444.9 increased 27%, or $518.6, due to higher volumes of 12%, favorable currency impacts of 7%, higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 5%, and positive pricing of 3%. the volume improvement was primarily driven by our base merchant business and new assets, including those from a business in israel that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020. while our liquid bulk business has largely recovered from covid-19, demand for packaged gases and hydrogen continues to be lower than pre-pandemic levels. favorable currency impacts were primarily driven by the appreciation of the british pound sterling and euro against the u.s. dollar. energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers was higher primarily in the second half of the year as we experienced significantly higher natural gas and electricity costs in europe. the pricing improvement was primarily attributable to our merchant business.
operating income of $557.4 increased 18%, or $84.1, due to higher volumes of $59, favorable currency impacts of $31, and positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $11, partially offset by unfavorable costs of $17. operating margin of 22.8% decreased 180 bp from 24.6% in the prior year, primarily due to impacts from higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which negatively impacted margin by approximately 100 bp, and unfavorable operating costs.
equity affiliates' income of $93.7 increased 25%, or $18.9, primarily due to higher income from affiliates in italy, saudi arabia, and south africa.

we present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), on an "adjusted" or "non-gaap" basis. on a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share ("eps"), adjusted ebitda, adjusted ebitda margin, adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures. on a segment basis, these measures include adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin. in addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-gaap financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or "non-gaap adjustments," have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted eps. for each non-gaap financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap.
our non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap. we believe these non-gaap financial measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of our business because such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with gaap, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results.
in many cases, non-gaap financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap measure to exclude non-gaap adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. for example, we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. the reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-gaap financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.
when applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-gaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-gaap adjustments. these tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.
table of contents adjusted diluted eps the table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. in periods that we have non-gaap adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. the per share impact for each non-gaap adjustment was calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted diluted eps due to rounding.

table of contents capital expenditures we define capital expenditures as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. a reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our reported capital expenditures is provided below:
cash used for investing activities                             $2,732.9          $3,560.0
other investing activities                                          5.8               3.9

liquidity and capital resources our cash balance and cash flows from operations are our primary sources of liquidity and are generally sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. in addition, we have the flexibility to access capital through a variety of financing activities, including accessing the capital markets, drawing upon our credit facility, or alternatively, accessing the commercial paper markets. at this time, we have not utilized, nor do we expect to access, our credit facility for additional liquidity. in addition, we have considered the impacts of covid-19 on our liquidity and capital resources and do not expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs.
as of 30 september 2021, we had $1,590.4 of foreign cash and cash items compared to total cash and cash items of $4,468.9. we do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to u.s. income tax upon repatriation to the u.s. depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside, the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. however, since we have significant current investment plans outside the u.s., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the u.s.

for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $3,335.2. other adjustments of $116.7 included pension plan contributions of $44.6 and pension income of $38.9 that did not have a cash impact. the working capital accounts were a source of cash of $16.7, primarily driven by a $187.9 source of cash from payables and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $130.5 use of cash from trade receivables, less allowances. the source of cash within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs, which also drove the use of cash within trade receivables as we contractually passed through these higher costs to customers.
table of contents for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $3,264.7. we recorded a net benefit of $13.5 on our consolidated income statements related to a recently enacted tax law in india during the second quarter. this net benefit, which is further discussed in note 21, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements, increased "undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates" by $33.8 and increased "deferred income taxes" by $20.3. the "gain on sale of assets and investments" of $45.8 includes a gain of $33.8 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters. refer to note 22, supplemental information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. the working capital accounts were a use of cash of $40.1, primarily driven by other working capital uses of $130.6, partially offset by a source of $84.4 from other receivables. the use of cash within "other working capital" was primarily due to timing of tax payments and a tax benefit as a result of the assets acquired in april 2020 from pbf energy inc. the source of cash within "other receivables" was primarily driven by maturities of forward exchange contracts.

cash used for investing activities                                      ($2,732.9)          ($3,560.0)
for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021, cash used for investing activities was $2,732.9. capital expenditures for plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,464.2. purchases of investments with terms greater than three months but less than one year of $2,100.7 exceeded proceeds from investments of $1,875.2, which resulted from maturities of time deposits and treasury securities.
for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2020, cash used for investing activities was $3,560.0. payments for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,509.0. this includes the acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from pbf energy inc. in delaware and california for approximately $580. additionally, acquisitions, less cash acquired, includes $183.3 for three businesses we acquired on 1 july 2020, the largest of which was a business in israel that primarily offers merchant gas products. refer to note 3, acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. purchases of investments of $2,865.5 related to time deposits and treasury securities with terms greater than three months and less than one year and exceeded proceeds from investments of $1,938.0. proceeds from sale of assets and investments of $80.3 included net proceeds of $44.1 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters.
capital expenditures capital expenditures is a non-gaap financial measure that we define as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. the components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below. we present a reconciliation of our capital expenditures to cash used for investing activities on page 36.
additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits          $2,464.2          $2,509.0
acquisitions, less cash acquired                                            10.5             183.3
capital expenditures                                                    $2,550.7          $2,716.7
capital expenditures in fiscal year 2021 totaled $2,550.7 compared to $2,716.7 in fiscal year 2020. the decrease of $166.0 was primarily driven by the prior year acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from pbf, partially offset by lower spending for acquisitions. additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements.
table of contents outlook for investing activities we expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 to be approximately $4.5 to $5 billion. in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we paid $1.6 billion, including approximately $130 from a non-controlling partner in one of our subsidiaries, for the initial investment in the jazan gasification and power project. we expect to make an additional investment of approximately $1 billion, which includes contribution from our non-controlling partner, for phase ii of the project in 2023. refer to note 24, subsequent events, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
it is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. these decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.
we anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. in addition, we intend to continue to evaluate (1) acquisitions of small- and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies; (2) purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and (3) investment in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth.
cash flows from financing activities fiscal year ended 30 september                                                             2021              2020

cash (used for) provided by financing activities                                 ($1,420.9)          $3,284.7
in fiscal year 2021, cash used for financing activities was $1,420.9 and primarily included dividend payments to shareholders of $1,256.7 and payments on long-term debt of $462.9, partially offset by long-term debt proceeds of $178.9 and investments by noncontrolling interests of $136.6. the payments on long-term debt included the repayment of a €350.0 million eurobond ($428) in june 2021.
in november 2021, we repaid our 3.0% senior note of $400, plus interest, on its maturity date.
in fiscal year 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $3,284.7 as we successfully accessed the debt markets in april 2020 to support opportunities for growth projects and repay upcoming debt maturities. long-term debt proceeds of $4,895.8 were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of $1,103.6 and payments on long-term debt of $406.6 primarily related to the repayment of a 2.0% eurobond of €300.0 million ($353.9) that matured on 7 august 2020. other financing activities were a use of cash of $97.2 and included financing charges associated with the third quarter debt issuance.
financing and capital structure capital needs in fiscal year 2021 were satisfied with cash from operations. total debt decreased from $7,907.8 as of 30 september 2020 to $7,637.2 as of 30 september 2021, primarily due to repayment of the €350 million eurobond, partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings on our foreign commitments. total debt includes related party debt of $358.4 and $338.5 as of 30 september 2021 and 30 september 2020, respectively, primarily associated with the lu'an joint venture. for additional detail, refer to note 14, debt, to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents on 31 march 2021, we entered into a five-year $2,500 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the "2021 credit agreement"), under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. the 2021 credit agreement provides a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. the only financial covenant in the 2021 credit agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to capitalization (equal to total debt plus total equity) not to exceed 70%. total debt as of 30 september 2021 and 30 september 2020, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization, was 35.2% and 38.9%, respectively. no borrowings were outstanding under the 2021 credit agreement as of 30 september 2021.
the 2021 credit agreement replaced our previous five-year $2,300.0 revolving credit agreement, which was to have matured on 31 march 2022. no borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement as of 30 september 2020 or at the time of its termination. no early termination penalties were incurred.
commitments of $296.7 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, $176.2 of which was borrowed and outstanding as of 30 september 2021.
as of 30 september 2021, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.
the board of directors determines whether to declare dividends and the timing and amount based on financial condition and other factors it deems relevant. in 2021, the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.50 per share, representing a 12% increase from the previous dividend of $1.34 per share. this is the 39th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.
discontinued operations in fiscal year 2021, cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of $6.7 resulted from cash received as part of a state tax settlement related to the sale of pmd in fiscal year 2017.
pension benefits we and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. the principal defined benefit pension plans are the u.s. salaried pension plan and the u.k. pension plan. these plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.
the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 september 2021 measurement date increased to $5,248.7 from $4,775.1 at the end of fiscal year 2020. the projected benefit obligation for these plans was $5,304.9 and $5,373.5 at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. the net unfunded liability decreased $542.2 from $598.4 to $56.2, primarily due to favorable asset experience. refer to note 15, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits.
pension (income)/expense, including special items noted below                   ($37.3)          $7.0
settlements, termination benefits, and curtailments ("special items")               1.8           5.2
we recognized pension income of $37.3 in fiscal year 2021 versus expense of $7.0 in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to lower interest cost and higher total assets. special items decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses.
2022 outlook in fiscal year 2022, we expect pension impacts to range from $5 million of income to $5 million of expense, which includes potential settlement losses of $5 to $10 million, depending on the timing of retirements. this forecast reflects a lower expected estimated return on assets due to the increased percentage of fixed income investments within the plan asset portfolios and higher interest cost, partially offset by lower forecasted actuarial loss amortization. in fiscal year 2022, our expected range of pension impacts includes approximately $80 for amortization of actuarial losses.
pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. with respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.
in addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. with the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. during 2021 and 2020, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $44.6 and $37.5, respectively.
for fiscal year 2022, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $40 to $50. the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. we do not expect covid-19 to impact our contribution forecast for fiscal year 2022.
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates refer to note 1, major accounting policies, and note 2, new accounting guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our major accounting policies and information concerning implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.
the accounting policies discussed below are those policies that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and/or future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. if conditions change, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors.
depreciable lives of plant and equipment plant and equipment, net at 30 september 2021 totaled $13,254.6, and depreciation expense totaled $1,284.1 during fiscal year 2021. plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.
economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially when business circumstances change. for example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, excessive wear and tear, or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. in these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.
the regional industrial gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer's facility. these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives. extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. as contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.
our regional industrial gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors' actions, etc.
in addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets, the remaining duration of long-term supply contracts served by the assets, and our historical experience with similar assets. management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change.
table of contents impairment of assets as discussed below, there were no triggering events in fiscal year 2021 that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups, reporting units that contain goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles assets, or equity method investments. we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded there were no indications of impairment.
impairment of assets - plant and equipment plant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign government-imposed restrictions or expropriations. plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances would include: (1) a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping; (2) a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition; (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset; (4) a reduction in revenues that is other than temporary; (5) a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping; or (6) changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.
if such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. if an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group's fair value and its carrying value. an estimate of the asset group's fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.
the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management's best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios. changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.
impairment of assets - goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. goodwill was $911.5 as of 30 september 2021. disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 9, goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.
we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. the tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. we have five reportable business segments, seven operating segments and ten reporting units, seven of which include a goodwill balance. refer to note 23, business segment and geographic information, for additional information. reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments.
as part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. however, we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
table of contents to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or adjusted ebitda margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or adjusted ebitda assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates.
if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. when the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. when both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test, noting no indications of impairment. the fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.
due to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 october 2021, we conducted an additional impairment test on our existing reporting units as of 30 september 2021. the fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value at 30 september 2021.
future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, changes in the strategy of the reporting unit, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.
impairment of assets - intangible assets intangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 september 2021 totaled $380.4 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. see the impairment discussion above under "impairment of assets - plant and equipment" for a description of how impairment losses are determined.
indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 september 2021 totaled $40.3 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. to determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.
in the fourth quarter of 2021, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles which resulted in no impairment.
table of contents impairment of assets - equity method investments investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,649.3 at 30 september 2021. the majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 7, summarized financial information of equity affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
an impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs. management's estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. we utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach. for the market approach, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies. changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.
in fiscal year 2021, there was no need to test any of our equity affiliate investments for impairment, as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.
revenue recognition - cost incurred input method revenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. we use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer.
accounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimates of revenues and costs. our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule delays, technical issues, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. when adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
in addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities, our sale of equipment projects within our industrial gases - global segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract.
we assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.
revenue recognition - on-site customer contracts for customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own and operate on or near the customer's facilities. certain of these on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition.
table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. as of 30 september 2021, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded as noncurrent, was $251.0, and net deferred tax liabilities were $1,080.7. tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2021 were $140.3, excluding interest and penalties. income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 september 2021 was $462.8. disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 21, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.
deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. however, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions, expense, and obligations associated with the defined benefit plans.
actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. we determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. note 15, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the u.s. and international plans. the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. mortality rates are based on the most recent u.s. and international mortality tables. we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. however, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover.
one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. we measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. the rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. these rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. a 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $20 per year.
table of contents the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. in determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans' liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. a 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $23 per year.
we use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses on equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. the market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value. expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.
loss contingencies in the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company. we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. when only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1, major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in note 16, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. for example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share of the liability increases. similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.

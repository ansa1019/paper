item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k in evaluating us and our common stock. some of these risks relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate, while others relate to the ownership of our common stock.
our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
risks relating to our business a substantial or extended decline in refining and marketing margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend.
our operating results, cash flows, future rate of growth, the carrying value of our assets and our ability to execute share repurchases and continue the payment of our base dividend are highly dependent on the margins we realize on our refined products. historically, refining and marketing margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile. our margins from the sale of gasoline and other refined products are influenced by a number of conditions, including the price of crude oil. the price of crude oil and the price at which we can sell our refined products may fluctuate independently due to a variety of regional and global market factors that are beyond our control, including:
•   transportation infrastructure availability, local market conditions and operation levels of other refineries in our markets;
•   natural gas and electricity supply costs incurred by refineries;
•   the ability of the members of opec to agree to and maintain production controls;
•   political instability, threatened or actual terrorist incidents, armed conflict, or other global political conditions;
•   local weather conditions;
•   seasonality of demand in our marketing area due to increased highway traffic in the spring and summer months;
•   the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy;
•   local, regional, national and worldwide economic conditions.
some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. the longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. we purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks weeks before we refine them and sell the refined products. price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. we also purchase refined products manufactured by others for resale to our customers. price changes during the periods between purchasing and reselling those refined products also could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
lower refining and marketing margins may reduce the amount of refined products we produce, which may reduce our revenues, income from operations and cash flows. significant reductions in refining and marketing margins could require us to reduce our capital expenditures, impair the carrying value of our assets (such as property, plant and equipment, inventory or goodwill), and decrease or eliminate our share repurchase activity and our base dividend.
our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our operations are subject to business interruptions such as scheduled refinery turnarounds, unplanned maintenance or unplanned events such as explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents, power outages, severe weather, labor disputes, or other natural or man-made disasters, such as acts of terrorism. for example, pipelines or railroads provide a nearly-exclusive form of transportation of crude oil to, or refined products from, some of our refineries. in such instances, a prolonged interruption, material reduction or cessation of service of such a pipeline or railway, whether due to private party or governmental action or other reason, could materially and adversely affect the operations, profitability and cash flows of the impacted refinery.
explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations may result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.
in addition, we operate in and adjacent to environmentally sensitive waters where tanker, pipeline, rail car and refined product transportation and storage operations are closely regulated by federal, state and local agencies and monitored by environmental interest groups. our coastal refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by tanker. in addition, our refineries receive crude oil and other feedstocks by rail car, truck and barge. transportation and storage of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined products over and adjacent to water involves inherent risk and subjects us to the provisions of the opa-90 and state laws in u.s. coastal and great lakes states and states bordering inland waterways on which we operate, as well as international laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. if we are unable to promptly and adequately contain any accident or discharge involving tankers, pipelines, rail cars or above ground storage tanks transporting or storing crude oil, other feedstocks or refined products, we may be subject to substantial liability. in addition, the service providers we have contracted to aid us in a discharge response may be unavailable due to weather conditions, governmental regulations or other local or global events. international, federal or state rulings could divert our response resources to other global events.
we do not insure against all potential losses, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected liabilities and increased costs.
we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards. uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards, including but not limited to, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases, cybersecurity breaches or other incidents involving our assets or operations, could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. marine vessel charter agreements may not provide complete indemnity for oil spills, and any marine charterer's liability insurance we carry may not cover all losses. historically, we also have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major facilities, with significant self-insured retentions. in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types and amounts we desire at reasonable rates.
we rely on the performance of our information technology systems, and the interruption or failure of any information technology system, including an interruption or failure due to a cybersecurity breach, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are heavily dependent on our information technology systems, including our network infrastructure and cloud applications, for the effective operation of our business. we rely on such systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee, customer, investor and payroll data, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including our supply chain, pipeline operations, gathering and processing operations, retail sales, credit card payments and authorizations at our retail outlets, financial transactions, banking and numerous other processes and transactions. these information systems involve data network and telecommunications, internet access and website functionality, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business. our systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events. we also face various other cybersecurity threats from criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusion, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance, including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable.
to protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack, we have implemented multiple layers of cybersecurity protections, infrastructure protection technologies, disaster recovery plans and employee training. while we have invested significant amounts in the protection of our technology systems and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over personally identifiable customer, investor and employee data, there can be no guarantee such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be effective.
certain vendors have access to sensitive information, including personally identifiable customer, investor and employee data and a breakdown of their technology systems or infrastructure as a result of a cyber-attack or otherwise could result in unauthorized disclosure of such information. unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or personally identifiable information, including by cyber-attacks or other security breach, could cause loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, reduce our customers' willingness to do business with us, disrupt the services we provide to customers and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. state and federal cybersecurity legislation could also impose new requirements, which could increase our cost of doing business.
competition in our industry is intense, and very aggressive competition could adversely impact our business.
we compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies, including certain multinational oil companies. competitors with integrated operations with exploration and production resources and broader access to resources may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions and to bear the risks inherent in the refining industry. for example, competitors that engage in exploration and production of crude oil may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.
we also face strong competition in the market for the sale of retail gasoline, diesel fuel and merchandise. our competitors include outlets owned or operated by fully integrated major oil companies or their dealers or jobbers, and other well-recognized national or regional retail outlets, often selling gasoline or merchandise at very competitive prices. several non-traditional retailers such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants are in the retail business. these non-traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the transportation fuels market and we expect their market share to grow. because of their diversity, integration of operations, experienced management and greater financial resources, these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability in the retail segment of the market. in addition, these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the pump and in the store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales. these activities by our competitors could pressure us to offer similar discounts, adversely affecting our profit margins.
additionally, the loss of market share by our convenience stores to these and other retailers relating to either gasoline or merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the development, availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business. we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers. increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations, technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability.
we utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil and refined products to and from our refineries. in addition to our own operational risks discussed above, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions. a prolonged disruption of the ability of the trucks, pipelines, railways or vessels to transport crude oil or refined products to or from one or more of our refineries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.
we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control over certain economic and business interests with our joint venture partners. our joint venture partners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals and interests or may be unable to meet their obligations. failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint-venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we may incur losses to our business as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.
we currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to enter into these types of transactions in the future. a failure of a futures commission merchant or counterparty to perform would affect these transactions. to the extent the instruments we utilize to manage these exposures are not effective, we may incur losses related to the ineffective portion of the derivative transaction or costs related to moving the derivative positions to another futures commission merchant or counterparty once a failure has occurred.
we have significant debt obligations; therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by a deterioration of our credit profile, a decrease in debt capacity or unsecured commercial credit available to us, or by factors adversely affecting credit markets generally.
at december 31, 2018, our total debt obligations for borrowed money and capital lease obligations were $27.98 billion, including $13.86 billion of obligations of mplx and $5.01 billion of obligations of andx. we may incur substantial additional debt obligations in the future.
•   increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;
•   limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;
•   limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders;
•   limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and
•   requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other purposes.
a decrease in our debt or commercial credit capacity, including unsecured credit extended by third-party suppliers, or a deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money and/or limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit. our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies. we cannot provide assurance that any of our credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. any changes in our credit capacity or credit profile could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we have a trade receivables securitization facility that provides liquidity of up to $750 million depending on the amount of eligible domestic trade accounts receivables. in periods of lower prices, we may not have sufficient eligible accounts receivables to support full availability of this facility.
historic or current operations could subject us to significant legal liability or restrict our ability to operate.
we currently are defending litigation and anticipate we will be required to defend new litigation in the future. our operations, including those of mplx and andx, and those of our predecessors and andeavor's predecessors could expose us to litigation and civil claims by private plaintiffs for alleged damages related to contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by releases of hazardous substances from our facilities, products liability, consumer credit or privacy laws, product pricing or antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations. while an adverse outcome in most litigation matters would not be expected to be material to us, in class-action litigation, large classes of plaintiffs may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances that could increase the amount of potential damages. attorneys general and other government officials may pursue litigation in which they seek to recover civil damages from companies on behalf of a state or its citizens for a variety of claims, including violation of consumer protection and product pricing laws or natural resources damages. we are defending litigation of that type and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation of that type in the future. if we are not able to successfully defend such litigation, it may result in liability to our company that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities. in addition to substantial liability, plaintiffs in litigation may also seek injunctive relief which, if imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
a portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
approximately 4,780 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. of these employees, approximately 1,465 employees at our galveston bay, mandan and martinez refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements which were set to expire on january 31, 2019. the parties continue their negotiations toward a new agreement, and are working under rolling extensions. approximately 425 employees at our martinez chemical plant, our los angeles refinery and our galveston bay refinery are covered by collective bargaining agreements expiring over the next several months. approximately 410 hourly employees at speedway are represented under collective bargaining agreements. the majority of these employees work at certain retail locations in new york and new jersey under agreements which expire on march 14, 2019 and june 30, 2019, respectively. the remaining speedway represented employees are drivers in minnesota under an agreement which expires in 2021. approximately 300 employees at our st. paul park and gallup refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in 2020. approximately 1,620 employees at our anacortes, canton, catlettsburg, los angeles, and salt lake city refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are due to expire in 2022. the remaining 560 hourly represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates ranging from 2021 to 2024. these contracts may be renewed at an increased cost to us. in addition, we have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements. any prolonged work stoppages disrupting operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, california requires refinery owners to pay prevailing wages to contract craft workers and restricts refiners' ability to hire qualified employees to a limited pool of applicants. legislation or changes in regulations could result in labor shortages higher labor costs, and an increased risk that contract employees become joint employees, which could trigger bargaining issues, employment discrimination liability issues as well as wage and benefit consequences, especially during critical maintenance and construction periods.
two of our subsidiaries act as general partners of publicly traded master limited partnerships, which may involve a greater exposure to certain legal liabilities than existed under our historic business operations.
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of mplx, a publicly traded mlp. another of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of andx, a publicly traded mlp. we acquired control of andx's general partner through the andeavor acquisition. our control of the general partners of mplx and andx may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest related to mplx and andx. any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if foreign investment in us or mplx exceeds certain levels, mplx could be prohibited from operating inland river vessels, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the shipping act of 1916 and merchant marine act of 1920, which we refer to collectively as the maritime laws, generally require that vessels engaged in u.s. coastwise trade be owned by u.s. citizens. among other requirements to establish citizenship, entities that own such vessels must be owned at least 75 percent by u.s. citizens. if we fail to maintain compliance with the maritime laws, mplx would be prohibited from operating vessels in the u.s. inland waters. such a prohibition could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to certain continuing contingent liabilities of marathon oil relating to taxes and other matters and to potential liabilities pursuant to the tax sharing agreement and separation and distribution agreement we entered into with marathon oil that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
although the spinoff occurred in mid-2011, certain liabilities of marathon oil could become our obligations. for example, under the internal revenue code of 1986 (the "code") and related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. in connection with the spinoff, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with marathon oil that allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the marathon oil consolidated tax reporting group between us and marathon oil. however, if marathon oil is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes. other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans as well as other contingent liabilities.
also pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, following the spinoff we are responsible generally for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries, whether accruing before, on or after the spinoff. we also agreed to be responsible for, and indemnify marathon oil with respect to, all taxes arising as a result of the spinoff (or certain internal restructuring transactions) failing to qualify as transactions under sections 368(a) and 355 of the code for u.s. federal income tax purposes to the extent such tax liability arises as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation by us or certain affiliates made in connection with the issuance of the private letter ruling relating to the spinoff or in the tax sharing agreement. in addition, we agreed to indemnify marathon oil for specified tax-related liabilities associated with our 2005 acquisition of the minority interest in our refining joint venture from ashland inc. our indemnification obligations to marathon oil and its subsidiaries, officers and directors are not limited or subject to any cap. if we are required to indemnify marathon oil and its subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors under the tax sharing agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. at this time, we cannot precisely quantify the amount of these liabilities that have been assumed pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, and there can be no assurances as to their final amounts.
also, in connection with the spinoff, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with marathon oil that provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions that were required to effect the spinoff, certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and marathon oil with respect to and resulting from the spinoff. among other things, the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to our downstream business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff, as well as certain obligations of marathon oil assumed by us. our obligations to indemnify marathon oil under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement could subject us to substantial liabilities. marathon oil also agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities retained by marathon oil, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from marathon oil will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, that marathon oil will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that marathon oil's insurers will cover us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff. moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from marathon oil or its insurers any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. the tax liabilities and underlying liabilities in the event marathon oil is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations described in this paragraph could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.
significant acquisitions in the future will involve the integration of new assets or businesses and present substantial risks that could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.
significant future transactions involving the addition of new assets or businesses will present potential risks, which may include, among others:
•   inaccurate assumptions about future synergies, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs;
•   an inability to successfully integrate assets or businesses we acquire;
•   a decrease in our liquidity resulting from using a portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement to finance transactions;
•   a significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance transactions;
•   the assumption of unknown environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;
a significant decrease or delay in oil and natural gas production in mplx's or andx's areas of operation, whether due to sustained declines in oil, natural gas and ngl prices, natural declines in well production, or otherwise, may adversely affect mplx's or andx's business, results of operations and financial condition, and could reduce their ability to make distributions to us.
a significant portion of mplx's operations are dependent upon production from oil and natural gas reserves and wells owned by its producer customers, which will naturally decline over time, which means that mplx's cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. to maintain or increase throughput levels and the utilization rate of mplx's facilities, mplx must continually obtain new oil, natural gas and ngl supplies, which depends in part on the level of successful drilling activity near its facilities. similarly, andx's operations are dependent in part on the production of crude oil in the bakken region and the production of natural gas and ngls in the green river, uinta and williston basins.
we have no control over the level of drilling activity in the areas of mplx's or andx's operations, the amount of reserves associated with the wells or the rate at which production from a well will decline. in addition, we have no control over producers or their production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, prevailing and projected energy prices, drilling costs per mcf or barrel, demand for hydrocarbons, operational challenges, access to downstream markets, the level of reserves, geological considerations, governmental regulations and the availability and cost of capital. because of these factors, even if new oil or natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by mplx or andx assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. if mplx and andx are not able to obtain new supplies of oil, natural gas or ngls to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on their pipelines and the utilization rates of their facilities would decline, which could have a material adverse effect on their business, results of operations and financial condition and could reduce their ability to make distributions to us.
decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity, production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves. the prices for oil, natural gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond our control, including global and local demand, production levels, changes in interstate pipeline gas quality specifications, imports and exports, seasonality and weather conditions, economic and political conditions domestically and internationally and governmental regulations. sustained periods of low prices could result in producers also significantly curtailing or limiting their oil and gas drilling operations which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of oil, natural gas and ngls to mplx's and andx's facilities and adversely affect their revenues and cash available for distribution to us. this impact may also be exacerbated due to the extent of mplx's commodity-based contracts, which are more directly impacted by changes in natural gas and ngl prices than its fee-based contracts due to frac spread exposure and may result in operating losses when natural gas becomes more expensive on a btu equivalent basis than ngl products. in addition, the purchase and resale of natural gas and ngls in the ordinary course exposes our midstream operations to volatility in natural gas or ngl prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales and the potential difference in the price associated with each transaction, and direct exposure may also occur naturally as a result of production processes. also, the significant volatility in natural gas, ngl and oil prices could adversely impact mplx's or andx's unit price, thereby increasing its distribution yield and cost of capital. such impacts could adversely impact mplx's and andx's ability to execute its long‐term organic growth projects, satisfy obligations to its customers and make distributions to unitholders at intended levels, and may also result in non-cash impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill or other-than-temporary non-cash impairments of our equity method investments.
significant stockholders may attempt to effect changes at our company or acquire control over our company, which could impact the pursuit of business strategies and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over our company. campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the management of our operations and the pursuit of our business strategies. as a result, stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we do not own all of the land on which certain of our assets are located, particularly our midstream assets, but rather obtain the rights to construct and operate such assets on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. therefore, we are subject to the possibility of more burdensome terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if our leases, rights-of-way or other property rights lapse or terminate or it is determined that we do not have valid leases, rights-of-way or other property rights. our loss of these rights, including loss through our inability to renew leases, right-of-way agreements or permits on satisfactory terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
risks relating to the andeavor acquisition the andeavor acquisition may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to mpc's earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share, which may negatively affect the market price of shares of mpc common stock.
the andeavor acquisition may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to mpc's earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share. earnings per share and cash flow from operations per share in the future are based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. in addition, future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected, including:
•   adverse changes in energy market conditions;
•   commodity prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;
•   competitive conditions;
•   capital expenditure obligations;
•   general economic conditions.
mpc has incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in connection with the andeavor acquisition, which may be in excess of those anticipated by mpc.
mpc has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the andeavor acquisition. mpc expects to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. these fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial.
mpc will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies' businesses. although mpc expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow mpc to offset integration-related costs
over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. see the risk factor below entitled "the integration of andeavor into mpc may not be as successful as anticipated."
the costs described above, as well as other unanticipated costs and expenses, could materially and adversely affect mpc's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
the andeavor acquisition involves numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax and other risks; potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; and uncertainties related to design, operation and integration of andeavor's internal control over financial reporting. difficulties in integrating andeavor into mpc may result in legacy andeavor assets performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among other factors:
•   the inability to successfully integrate the businesses of andeavor into mpc in a manner that permits mpc to achieve the full revenue and cost savings anticipated from the merger;
•   complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, integrated business;
•   integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services;
•   potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger;
•   integrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners;
mpc's results may suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the andeavor acquisition.
mpc's success depends, in part, on its ability to manage its expansion following the andeavor acquisition, which poses numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate the operations and business of andeavor into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers, vendors and business partners.
mpc may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the andeavor acquisition.
the success of the andeavor acquisition depends, in part, on mpc's ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining mpc's and andeavor's businesses, including the annual gross, run-rate, commercial and corporate synergies that mpc expects to realize within the first three years after the combination. the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the andeavor acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, may require more non-recurring costs and expenditures to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects. some of the assumptions that mpc has made, such as with respect to anticipated: operating synergies or the costs associated with realizing such synergies; significant long-term cash flow generation; the benefit from a substantial increase in scale and geographic diversity; complementary growth platforms for both midstream and retail businesses; positioning for potentially significant benefits from the international maritime organization change in specifications for marine bunker fuel; the expansion in opportunities for logistics growth in crude oil production basins and regions; further optimization of crude supply; and the continuation of mpc's investment grade credit profile, may not be realized. the integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. there could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the andeavor acquisition that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence.
we accounted for the andeavor and other acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets and liabilities of the acquired business be recorded to our balance sheet at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. any excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recognized as goodwill.
as of december 31, 2018, our balance sheet reflected $20.2 billion and $3.4 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets, respectively. these amounts include the preliminary estimates of goodwill and other intangible assets of $16.3 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, recognized in connection with the andeavor acquisition. to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment.
risks related to our industry meeting the requirements of evolving environmental or other laws or regulations may reduce our refining and marketing margin and may result in substantial capital expenditures and operating costs that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
•   characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels,

the specific impact of laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes. we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the epa's national ambient air quality standards ("naaqs") are among the regulations that impact our operations. in october 2015, the epa reduced the primary (health) ozone naaqs to 70 ppb from the prior ozone level of 75 ppb. on november 6, 2017, the epa finalized ozone attainment/unclassifiable designations under the new standard. in actions dated april 30, 2018, and july 25, 2018, the epa finalized nonattainment designations for certain areas under the lower primary ozone standard. in some areas, these nonattainment designations could result in increased costs associated with, or result in cancellation or delay of, capital projects at our facilities. states will also be required to adopt sips for nonattainment areas. these sips may include nox and/or voc reductions that could result in increased costs to our facilities. we cannot predict the various sip requirements at this time. the epa announced that it plans to review the naaqs level for particulate matter ("pm"). a reduction in the pm naaqs and subsequent designation of nonattainment could also result in increased costs associated with, or result in cancellation or delay of, capital projects at our facilities.
the eisa established increases in fuel mileage standards. the department of transportation's national highway safety administration and the epa work in conjunction to establish cafe standards and greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty vehicles that become more stringent over time. in addition, pursuant to a waiver granted by the epa, california and other states have enacted laws that require vehicle emission reductions. increases in fuel mileage standards and requirements for zero emission vehicles may reduce demand for refined product.
the eisa also expanded the renewable fuel standard ("rfs") program administered by the epa. governmental regulations encouraging the use of new or alternative fuels could pose a competitive threat to our operations. the eisa required the total
volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the u.s. to reach 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. the rfs presents production and logistics challenges for both the renewable fuels and petroleum refining industries, and may continue to require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. gasoline consumption has been lower than forecasted by the epa, which has led to concerns that the renewable fuel volumes may not be met. on november 30, 2018, epa finalized rfs volume requirements for the year 2019, and the biomass-based diesel volume requirement for year 2020. the epa used its cellulosic waiver authority to reduce the volumes for 2019 from the statutory amounts to the following: 19.92 billion gallons total renewable fuel; 4.92 billion gallons advanced biofuel; and 418 million gallons cellulosic biofuel. the epa set the biomass-based diesel volume requirement for 2020 at 2.43 billion gallons, which is significantly greater than the statutory floor of 1.0 billion gallons.
tax incentives and other subsidies have also made renewable fuels more competitive with refined products than they otherwise would have been, which may further reduce refined product margins. the tax incentives and subsidies are causing uncertainties because they have expired and been reinstituted retroactively. the biodiesel credit, for example, expired at the end of 2016 and was retroactively reinstated in early 2018. it is not certain whether the credit will be reinstituted beyond 2018.
on march 3, 2014, the epa signed the final tier 3 fuel standards. the final tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. in addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm, while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. since 2014, we have made approximately $490 million in capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards. for 2019, we expect an additional $260 million of capital expenditures to comply with these standards.
federal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could delay or impede producer's gas production or result in reduced volumes available for our midstream assets to gather, process and fractionate. while we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, we do provide gathering, processing and fractionation services with respect to natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by our customers as a result of such operations. if federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in shale formations and increase producers' costs of compliance.
climate change and greenhouse gas emission regulation could affect our operations, energy consumption patterns and regulatory obligations, any of which could affect our results of operations and financial condition.
currently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) and other emissions are in various phases of consideration, promulgation or implementation. these include actions to develop international, federal, regional or statewide programs, which could require reductions in our greenhouse gas or other emissions, establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for our refined products. requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.
for example, in california, the state legislature adopted sb 32 in 2016. sb 32 set a cap on emissions of 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 but did not establish a particular mechanism to achieve that target. the legislature also adopted a companion bill, ab 197, that most significantly directs the carb to prioritize direct emission reductions on large stationary sources. in 2017, the state legislature adopted ab 398 which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40% reduction target from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in sb 32. in 2009, carb adopted the low carbon fuel standard ("lcfs"). the lcfs was amended again in 2018 with the current version targeting a 20% reduction in fuel carbon intensity from a 2010 baseline by 2030. compliance is demonstrated by blending lower carbon intensity biofuels into gasoline and diesel or by purchasing credits. compliance with each of the cap and trade and lcfs programs is demonstrated through a market-based credit system. other states are proposing, or have already promulgated, low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. if we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers, sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase, we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits, or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
regional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex, subject to change and considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility, legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy. increasing concerns about climate change have also resulted in a number of international and national measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. additional stricter measures can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition.
international climate change-related efforts, such as the 2015 united nations conference on climate change, which led to the creation of the paris agreement, may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations. though the united states has announced its intention to withdraw from the paris agreement, withdrawal
it is not possible until november 2019 at the earliest. if the united states declines to withdraw, the extent of such regulation and the cost associated with compliance cannot be predicted.
we could also face increased climate‐related litigation with respect to our operations or products. governmental and other entities in california, new york, maryland and rhode island have filed lawsuits against coal, gas, oil and petroleum companies, including the company. the lawsuits allege damages as a result of climate change and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on the company's business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.
regulatory and other requirements concerning the transportation of crude oil and other commodities by rail may cause increases in transportation costs or limit the amount of crude oil that we can transport by rail.
we rely on a variety of systems to transport crude oil, including rail. rail transportation is regulated by federal, state and local authorities. new regulations or changes in existing regulations could result in increased compliance expenditures. for example, in 2015 the u.s. department of transportation issued new standards and regulations applicable to crude-by-rail transportation (enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for high-hazard flammable trains). these or other regulations that require the reduction of volatile or flammable constituents in crude oil that is transported by rail, change the design or standards for rail cars used to transport the crude oil we purchase, change the routing or scheduling of trains carrying crude oil, or require any other changes that detrimentally affect the economics of delivering north american crude oil by rail could increase the time required to move crude oil from production areas to our refineries, increase the cost of rail transportation and decrease the efficiency of shipments of crude oil by rail within our operations. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
severe weather events and other climate conditions may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations.
we have mature systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks, such as floods, hurricane-force winds, wildfires and snowstorms, and potential chronic physical risks, such as higher ocean levels. if any such events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. specifically, where appropriate, we are hardening and modernizing assets against weather damage and ensuring we have resiliency measures in place, such as storm-specific readiness plans. we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to protect our assets and operations from such physical risks and employ the evolving technologies and processes available to mitigate such risks. to the extent such severe weather events or other climate conditions increase in frequency and severity, we may be required to modify operations and incur costs that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
plans we may have to expand existing assets or construct new assets are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. such risks could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies.
our anticipated growth and planned expenditures are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable and existing regulations will remain intact to allow for the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand existing assets and to construct additional assets. however, policy decisions relating to the production, refining, transportation and marketing of carbon-based fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups. one of the ways we may grow our business is through the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing ones. the construction of a new pipeline or the expansion of an existing pipeline, by adding horsepower or pump stations or by adding additional pipelines along existing pipelines, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties, most of which are beyond our control. the approval process for storage and transportation projects has become increasingly challenging, due in part to state and local concerns related to pipelines, negative public perception regarding the oil and gas industry, and concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions downstream of pipeline operations. in addition, government disruptions, such as a u.s. federal government shutdown, may delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits, licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business. we have experienced construction delays related to these factors as a result of the u.s. federal government's recent shutdown. our expansion or construction projects may not be completed on schedule (or at all) or at the budgeted cost. in addition, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. for instance, if we build a new pipeline, the construction will occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities (including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities) could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results, thereby limiting our ability to grow and generate cash flows.
large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting project returns. if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results. delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce. such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
•   denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and/or permits;
•   adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors or suppliers;
•   market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and
•   nonperformance by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or subcontractors.
any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects. if we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the availability of crude oil and increases in crude oil prices may reduce profitability and refining and marketing margins.
the profitability of our operations depends largely on the difference between the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we obtain for refined products. a portion of our crude oil is purchased from various foreign national oil companies, production companies and trading companies, including suppliers from canada, the middle east and various other international locations. the market for crude oil and other feedstocks is largely a world market. we are, therefore, subject to the attendant political, geographic and economic risks of such a market. if one or more major supply sources were temporarily or permanently eliminated, we believe adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our operations, sales of refined products and refining and marketing margins could be adversely affected, materially and adversely impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to risks arising from our non-u.s. operations and generally to worldwide political and economic developments.
we have expanded the scope of our non-u.s. operations through the andeavor acquisition, particularly in mexico, south america and asia. our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by disruptions in any of these markets, including economic instability, restrictions on the transfer of funds, duties and tariffs, transportation delays, import and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest, security issues involving key personnel and changing regulatory and political environments. in addition, if trade relationships deteriorate with these countries, if existing trade agreements are modified or terminated, new economic sanctions relevant to such jurisdictions are passed or if taxes, border adjustments or tariffs make trading with these countries more costly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are required to comply with u.s. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws and regulations prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. our compliance policies and programs mandate compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws but may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance. our training and compliance program and our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from violations committed by our employees or agents. actual or alleged violations of
these laws could disrupt our business and cause us to incur significant legal expenses, and could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
more broadly, political and economic factors in global markets could impact crude oil and other feedstock supplies and could have a material adverse effect on us in other ways. hostilities in the middle east or the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the u.s. and other developed countries. a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for refined products, ngls and natural gas. additionally, these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult and/or costly for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate. additionally, tax policy, legislative or regulatory action and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability. for example, the u.s. government could prevent or restrict exports of refined products, ngls, natural gas or the conduct of business in or with certain foreign countries. in addition, foreign countries could restrict imports, investments or commercial transactions.
compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
additionally, many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities, and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties.
terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities or that impact our customers or the markets we serve could adversely affect our business.
the u.s. government has issued warnings that energy assets in general, including the nation's refining, pipeline and terminal infrastructure, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. the threat of terrorist attacks has subjected our operations to increased risks. any future terrorist attacks on our facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other pipelines, could have a material adverse effect on our business. similarly, any future terrorist attacks that severely disrupt the markets we serve could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
risks relating to ownership of our common stock provisions in our corporate governance documents could operate to delay or prevent a change in control of our company, dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our capital stock or affect its liquidity.
the existence of some provisions within our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable. these include provisions:
•   providing for the division of our board of directors into three classes with staggered terms;
•   limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;
•   prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;
•   establishing supermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation;
•   authorizing a large number of shares of common stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us; and
we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. however, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition.
our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. for example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our board of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.
finally, to facilitate compliance with the maritime laws, our restated certificate of incorporation limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non-u.s. citizens of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock to 23 percent of the outstanding shares. we may prohibit transfers that would cause ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock by non-u.s. citizens to exceed 23 percent. our restated certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to effect any and all measures necessary or desirable to monitor and limit foreign ownership of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock. these limitations could have an adverse impact on the liquidity of the market for our common stock if holders are unable to transfer shares to non-u.s. citizens due to the limitations on ownership by non-u.s. citizens. any such limitation on the liquidity of the market for our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all statements in this section, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. see "disclosures regarding forward-looking statements" and "risk factors" for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. the following information concerning our business, results of operations and financial condition should also be read in conjunction with the information included under item 1. business, item 1a. risk factors, item 6. selected financial data and item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
corporate overview we are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream company. we own and operate the nation's largest refining system through 16 refineries, located in the gulf coast, mid-continent and west coast regions of the united states, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 3.0 mmbpcd. our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers across the united states. we distribute refined products to our customers through transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services provided largely by our midstream segment. we believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers in the united states.
we have three strong brands: marathon®,  speedway® and arco®. the branded outlets, which primarily include the marathon brand, are established motor fuel brands across the united states available through approximately 6,800 branded outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 35 states, the district of columbia and mexico. we believe our retail segment operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the united states, with approximately 3,920 convenience stores, primarily under the speedway brand, and 1,065 direct dealer locations, primarily under the arco brand, across the united states.
we primarily conduct our midstream operations through our ownership interests in mplx and andx, which own and operate crude oil and light product transportation and logistics infrastructure as well as gathering, processing, and fractionation assets. as of december 31, 2018, we owned, leased or had ownership interests in approximately 16,600 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. we distribute our refined products through one of the largest terminal operations in the united states and one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and ngls from some of the largest supply basins in the united states to domestic and international markets. our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and ngl gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. our assets include approximately 9.9 bcf/d of gathering capacity, 11.0 bcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 790 mbpd of fractionation capacity as of december 31, 2018.
our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: refining & marketing; retail; and midstream. each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. see item 1. business for additional information on our segments.
•   refining &amp; marketing - refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our 16 refineries in the west coast, gulf coast and mid-continent regions of the united states, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products largely through transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services provided largely by our midstream segment. we sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our retail business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate primarily marathon® branded outlets.
•   retail - sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market across the united states through company-owned and operated convenience stores, primarily under the speedway brand, and long-term fuel supply contracts with direct dealers who operate locations mainly under the arco brand.
•   midstream - transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for the refining &amp; marketing segment via refining logistics assets, pipelines, terminals, towboats and barges; gathers, processes and transports natural gas; and gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets ngls. the midstream segment primarily reflects the results of mplx and andx, our sponsored master limited partnerships.
recent developments andeavor acquisition on october 1, 2018, we completed the andeavor acquisition. under the terms of the merger agreement, andeavor stockholders had the option to choose 1.87 shares of mpc common stock or $152.27 in cash per share of andeavor common stock. the merger agreement included election proration provisions that resulted in approximately 22.9 million shares of andeavor common stock being converted into cash consideration and the remaining 128.2 million shares of andeavor common stock being converted into stock consideration. andeavor stockholders received in the aggregate approximately 239.8 million shares of mpc common stock valued at $19.8 billion and approximately $3.5 billion in cash in connection with the andeavor acquisition. through the andeavor acquisition, we acquired the general partner and 156 million common units of andx, which is a publicly traded mlp that was formed to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics assets.
andeavor was a highly integrated marketing, logistics and refining company operating primarily in the western and mid-continent united states. andeavor's operations included procuring crude oil from its source or from other third parties, transporting the crude oil to one of its 10 refineries, and producing, marketing and distributing refined products. its marketing system included more than 3,300 stations marketed under multiple well-known fuel brands including arco®. also, as noted above, we acquired the general partner and 156 million common units of andx, a leading growth-oriented, full service, and diversified midstream company which owns and operates networks of crude oil, refined products and natural gas pipelines, terminals with crude oil and refined products storage capacity, rail loading and offloading facilities, marine terminals including storage, bulk petroleum distribution facilities, a trucking fleet and natural gas processing and fractionation complexes.
this transaction combined two strong, complementary companies to create a leading nationwide u.s. downstream energy company. the acquisition substantially increases our geographic diversification and scale and strengthens each of our operating segments by diversifying our refining portfolio into attractive markets and increasing access to advantaged feedstocks, enhancing our midstream footprint in the permian basin, and creating a nationwide retail and marketing portfolio all of which is expected to substantially improve efficiencies and our ability to serve customers. we expect the combination to generate up to approximately $1.4 billion in gross run-rate synergies within the first three years, significantly enhancing our long-term cash flow generation profile.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 for additional information on other acquisitions and investments in affiliates.
mplx financing activities in november 2018, mplx issued $2.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering. in december 2018, a portion of the net proceeds from the offering was used to redeem the $750 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due february 2023 issued by mplx and markwest. the remaining net proceeds have or will be used to repay borrowings under mplx's revolving credit facility and intercompany loan with mpc and for general partnership purposes.
executive summary results select results for 2018 and 2017 are reflected in the following table. the 2018 amounts include the results of andeavor from the october 1, 2018 acquisition date forward.

net income attributable to mpc decreased $652 million, or $1.42 per diluted share, in 2018 compared to 2017. increased income from operations was more than offset by the absence of a tax benefit of $1.5 billion resulting from the tcja in 2017 and increased net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2018. refer to the results of operations section for a discussion of financial results by segment for the three years ended december 31, 2018.
mplx and andx on february 1, 2018, we contributed our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to mplx in exchange for $4.1 billion in cash and approximately 114 million newly issued mplx units. immediately following the dropdown, our idrs were cancelled and our economic general partner interest was converted into a non-economic general partner interest, all in exchange for 275 million newly issued mplx common units. mplx financed the cash portion of the february 1, 2018 dropdown with its $4.1 billion 364-day term loan facility, which was entered into on january 2, 2018. on february 8, 2018, mplx issued $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering. mplx used $4.1 billion of the net proceeds of the offering to repay the 364-day term-loan facility. the remaining proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under mplx's revolving credit facility and intercompany loan agreement with us and for general partnership purposes.
the following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from mplx during 2018 and 2017 and andx distributions received after the october 1, 2018 acquisition of andeavor.

we owned approximately 505 million mplx common units at december 31, 2018 with a market value of $15.29 billion based on the december 31, 2018 closing unit price of $30.30. on january 25, 2019, mplx declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.6475 per common unit, which was paid february 14, 2019. as a result, mplx made distributions totaling $514 million to its common unitholders. mpc's portion of this distribution was approximately $327 million.
we owned approximately 156 million andx common units at december 31, 2018 with a market value of $5.07 billion based on the december 31, 2018 closing unit price of $32.49. on january 25, 2019, andx declared a quarterly cash distribution of $1.03 per common unit, which was paid february 14, 2019. as a result, andx made distributions totaling $238 million to its common unitholders. mpc's portion of this distribution was approximately $146 million.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 4 for additional information on mplx and andx.
liquidity as of december 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.61 billion, excluding mplx's and andx's cash and cash equivalents of $68 million and $10 million, respectively, and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our $6.0 billion bank revolving credit facilities or under our $750 million trade receivables securitization facility ("trade receivables facility"). as of december 31, 2018, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $750 million under the trade receivable facility. as of december 31, 2018, mplx had approximately $2.25 billion available under its $2.25 billion revolving credit agreement and $1 billion available through its intercompany loan agreement with mpc. as of december 31, 2018, andx had $855 million available under its $2.10 billion revolving credit agreements and $500 million available through its intercompany loan agreement with mpc.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for information on our new bank revolving credit facilities.
overview of segments refining & marketing refining & marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining & marketing margin and refinery throughputs. our total refining capacity was 3,021 mbpcd, 1,881 mbpcd and 1,817 mbpcd as of december 31, 2018, 2017 and
2016, respectively. the increase in 2018 was primarily due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1, 2018, which added 10 refineries with approximately 1,117 mbpcd of total refining capacity.
our refining & marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. as a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate west coast, mid-continent and gulf coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. the following will be used for these crack-spread calculations:
the following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.

sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)            450
sweet differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)           370
natural gas price sensitivity(d) (per $1.00/mmbtu)                    300
(a)   crack spread based on 38 percent wti, 38 percent lls and 24 percent ans with mid-continent, gulf coast and west coast product pricing, respectively and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.
in addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sour differential and the sweet differential, our refining & marketing margin is impacted by factors such as:
•   the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; and
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. at december 31, 2018, market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year. based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. the following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years and only reflects the activity for the acquired refineries after october 1, 2018.
2018   canton, detroit, galveston bay and martinez
2016   galveston bay, garyville and robinson we have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with mplx and andx. under these agreements, mplx and andx, which are reported in our midstream segment, provide transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services to our refining & marketing segment. certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil, refined products and other products. certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets.
retail our retail fuel margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers or direct dealers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees (where applicable), impacts the retail segment profitability. gasoline and distillate prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in supply and demand in the regions where we operate. numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. according to current estimates, 2018 gasoline demand remained at 9.3 million barrels per day for the third consecutive year. headwinds from a four-year high in average gasoline prices during 2018 offset the gasoline demand support from continuing economic growth and slowing fleet fuel efficiency gains. meanwhile, distillate demand was up for the second consecutive year on continuing economic growth in 2018, rising 5.2 percent from 2017 to the highest level since 2007 and the third highest u.s. demand level ever. truck tonnage posted its largest annual increase since 1998, rising 6.6 percent year over year in 2018, while port container traffic (at the 10 largest u.s. ports), grew 4.5 percent year over year in 2018 (through november). the margin on merchandise sold at our convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to our retail segment margin. almost half of our retail margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2018. this percentage decreased from 2017 due to the addition of long-term fuel supply contracts with direct dealers and fuel only locations as part of the andeavor acquisition. our retail convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. costs of refined products and merchandise are stated under the lifo inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. as of december 31, 2018, market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no lcm inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the year. based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.
midstream our midstream segment transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products, principally for our refining & marketing segment. the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. the profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. the profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals. the profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products. the profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets. a majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our refining & marketing segment and our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our refining & marketing segment. as discussed above in the refining & marketing section, mplx and andx, which are reported in our midstream segment, have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements related to services provided to our refining & marketing segment. under these agreements, mplx and andx have received various commitments of minimum throughput, storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets. the volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine
operations. key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. the volume of refined products that we transport, store, distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. in most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from may through september of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. as with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.
ngl and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of ngl transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. our midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‐party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‐related prices and the cost of third‐party transportation and fractionation services. to the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.
results of operations the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. the 2018 amounts include the results of andeavor from the october 1, 2018 acquisition date forward. this discussion should be read in conjunction with item 8. financial statements and supplementary data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance.

(a)   we adopted asu 2014-09, revenue - revenue from contracts with customers ("asc 606") as of january 1, 2018, and elected to report certain taxes on a net basis. we adopted the standard using the modified retrospective method, and, therefore, comparative information continues to reflect certain taxes on a gross basis. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes 2 and 3 for further information.
net income attributable to mpc decreased $652 million. increased income from operations was more than offset by a tax benefit of $1.5 billion resulting from the tcja in 2017 and increased income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2018. see segment results for additional information.
•   increased sales and other operating revenues of $21.65 billion mainly due to an increase in our refining &amp; marketing segment refined product sales volumes, which increased 402 mbpd, and higher averaged refined product sales prices, which increased $0.34 per gallon. the increase in volume is largely due to the andeavor acquisition on october 1, 2018. these increases were partially offset by our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under asc 606 prospectively from january 1, 2018, which resulted in a decrease in revenues of $6.66 billion for the year. see item 8.
financial statements and supplementary data - notes 2 and 3 for additional information on recently adopted accounting standards;
•   increased income from equity method investments of $67 million primarily due to an increase in income from midstream equity affiliates; and
◦   an increase in refined product cost of sales of $24.97 billion, primarily due to increased operations following the acquisition of andeavor along with higher raw material costs attributable to an increase in our average crude oil costs of $13.87 per barrel; and
◦   a decrease in certain taxes of $6.66 billion as a result of our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under asc 606 prospectively from january 1, 2018. for the year, certain taxes continue to be presented on a gross basis and are included in cost of revenues. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes 2 and 3 for additional information on recently adopted accounting standards;
•   increased depreciation and amortization of $376 million, primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the andeavor acquisition;
•   increased selling, general and administrative expenses of $724 million primarily due to approximately $197 million of transaction related costs for financial advisors, employee severance and other costs associated with the andeavor acquisition in addition to increased costs and expenses for the combined company; and
net interest and other financial costs increased $329 million mainly due to increased mplx borrowings and debt assumed in the acquisition of andeavor. in addition, mplx recognized $60 million of debt extinguishment costs in 2018 in connection with the redemption of its $750 million of senior notes due in 2023. we capitalized interest of $80 million in 2018 and $55 million in 2017. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for further details.
provision for income taxes increased $1.42 billion primarily due to the absence of a tax benefit of $1.5 billion in 2017 resulting from the tcja and an increase in our income before income taxes, which increased $1.22 billion. the effective tax rate of 21 percent in 2018 is consistent with the u.s. statutory rate of 21 percent, as permanent benefit differences related to income attributable to noncontrolling interest were offset by state and local tax expense. in 2017, our effective tax rate was impacted by 45 percentage points as a result of the tcja which decreased our effective tax rate from 31 percent to (14) percent. the effective tax rate, excluding the tcja, of 31 percent in 2017 was slightly less than the u.s. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 12 for further details.
noncontrolling interests increased $454 million due to higher mplx net income resulting primarily from the february 1, 2018 dropdown transaction, partially offset by the reduced ownership in mplx held by noncontrolling interests following the gp/idr exchange. noncontrolling ownership in mplx decreased to 36.4 percent at december 31, 2018 from 69.6 percent at december 31, 2017. in addition, 2018 reflects $68 million of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in andx of 36.4 percent for the period from october 1, 2018 through the end of the year.
net income attributable to mpc increased $2.26 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a tax benefit of $1.5 billion resulting from the tcja enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase in our refining & marketing segment income from operations of $964 million. see segment results for additional information.
•   increased sales to related parties of $567 million mainly due to sales from our refining &amp; marketing segment to pfj southeast, a joint venture with pilot flying j, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016;
•   increased income (loss) from equity method investments of $491 million primarily due to the absence of impairment charges related to equity method investments of $356 million recorded in 2016 along with increases in income from new and existing pipeline, natural gas, retail and marine affiliates;
•   decreased impairment expense of $130 million as the impairment expense in 2016 reflects a $130 million charge recorded by mplx to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the markwest merger; and
•   increased selling, general and administrative expenses of $97 million primarily due to increases in employee-related compensation and benefit expenses, higher corporate costs and net litigation settlement expenses of $29 million.
net interest and other financial costs increased $110 million in 2017 compared to 2016 mainly due to the mplx senior notes issued in february 2017 and a $45 million increase in pension settlement expenses, partially offset by decreased borrowings on the mpc term loan agreement. we capitalized interest of $55 million in 2017 and $63 million in 2016. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for further details.
provision for income taxes decreased $1.07 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. the tcja was signed into law on december 22, 2017 and provided several key changes to u.s. tax law, including a federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent replacing the 2017 rate applicable to mpc of 35 percent. mpc was required to calculate the effect of the tcja on its deferred tax balances as of the enactment date. the effect of the federal corporate income tax rate change reduced net deferred tax liabilities by $1.5 billion in 2017. this benefit was partially offset by an increase in our income before income taxes, which increased $1.52 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. the tcja impacted our effective tax rate by 45 percentage points in 2017, decreasing our effective tax rate from 31 percent to (14) percent. the effective tax rates, excluding the tcja in 2017, of 31 percent in 2017 and 33 percent in 2016, are slightly less than the u.s. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 12 for further details.
(a)   we adopted asc 606 (revenue from contracts with customers), as of january 1, 2018, and elected to report certain taxes on a net basis. we applied the standard using the modified retrospective method, and, therefore, comparative information continues to reflect certain taxes on a gross basis.
(b)   results related to refining logistics and fuels distribution are presented in the midstream segment prospectively from february 1, 2018. prior periods are not adjusted as these entities were not considered a business prior to february 1, 2018.
(b)   for comparability purposes, these amounts exclude sales taxes for all periods presented. as noted above, refining &amp; marketing revenues in 2018 reflect these taxes on a net basis, while 2017 and 2016 refining &amp; marketing revenues continue to reflect these taxes on a gross basis. the average refined product sales prices for 2017 and 2016 included excise taxes of $0.18 per gallon before this adjustment.
(f)   includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs.
the following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our refining & marketing segment's business. with the acquisition of andeavor, we revised our market data to include a west coast 3-2-1 crack spread. additionally, the chicago 6-3-2-1 crack spread was revised to reflect a mid-continent 3-2-1 crack spread and the gulf coast 6-3-2-1 crack spread was also revised to reflect a 3-2-1 crack spread. see the "overview of segments" section for further discussion of our revised crack spreads.
(a)   blended 3-2-1 wti/lls/ans crack spread 38/38/24 percent in 2018, blended 6-3-2-1 chicago/usgc crack spread is 40/60 percent for the first nine months of 2018 and in 2017 and 38/62 percent in 2016. these blends are based on mpc's refining capacity by region in each period.
(b)   beginning 4q 2018, blended mid-con/usgc/west coast crack spread is weighted 38/38/24 percent based on mpc's refining capacity by padd. from q1 2017 through q3 2018, the blended spread was weighted 40/60 percent mid-con/usgc.
refining & marketing segment revenues increased $17.91 billion primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes, which increased 402 mbpd, and higher refined product sales prices, which increased $0.34 per gallon. the increase in sales volumes is largely due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1, 2018. these increases were partially offset by our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under asc 606 prospectively from january 1, 2018, which resulted in a decrease in refining & marketing segment revenues of $4.58 billion in 2018. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes 2 and 3 for additional information on recently adopted accounting standards.
refining & marketing segment income from operations increased $160 million primarily due to higher throughputs as a result of the andeavor acquisition as well as wider sour and sweet crude differentials. for comparison purposes, as noted in the market indicators table, 2017 indicators have been included which reflect the new indicators we began using subsequent to the acquisition of andeavor. based on this, the usgc, mid-continent and west coast blended 3-2-1 crack spread was $10.62 per barrel in 2018 as compared to 10.22 per barrel in 2017. these crack spreads are net of rin crack adjustments of $1.61 and $3.57 for 2018 and 2017, respectively.
based on changes in the market indicators shown above and our refinery throughputs, we estimate a positive impact of $3.40 billion on refining & marketing segment income from operations, of which $1.81 billion and $1.59 billion are due to the effects of changes in price and volume, respectively. the market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of lcm inventory valuation adjustments, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had an estimated negative impact on refining & marketing segment income from operations of $698 million in 2018 compared to 2017. the significant elements of the negative impact were unfavorable crude acquisition costs and unfavorable product price realizations relative to the market indicators.
refinery direct operating costs decreased $0.12 per barrel in 2018 compared to 2017. the decrease includes a $0.13 per barrel decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs and a $0.12 per barrel decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily due to higher refinery throughput resulting from the addition of 10 refineries as part of the acquisition of andeavor. total turnaround costs increased due to costs related to these additional refineries as well as higher turnaround costs at our detroit and canton refineries, partially offset by lower turnaround costs at our galveston bay and garyville refineries. the increase in other manufacturing costs of $0.13 per barrel is mainly due to costs associated with the acquired refineries, partially offset by an increase in throughput due to the acquisition of andeavor. in addition, manufacturing costs and depreciation and amortization costs per barrel decreased due to the dropdown of refining and logistics assets to mplx on february 1, 2018.
we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance. our expenses associated with purchased rins were $316 million in 2018 compared to $457 million in 2017. the decrease in 2018 was primarily due to lower weighted average rin costs which more than offset the increase in our rins obligation subsequent to the acquisition of andeavor.
(c)   lls (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: arab light, kuwait, maya, western canadian select and mars].
refining & marketing segment income from operations increased $964 million in 2017 compared to 2016. segment income in 2016 includes a $345 million non-cash benefit related to the company's lcm inventory reserve. excluding the lcm inventory
benefit, the increase in segment results for 2017 primarily resulted from higher lls crack spreads in both the u.s. gulf coast and chicago markets. the lls blended crack spread for 2017 increased to $9.84 per barrel from $6.96 per barrel in 2016. these favorable effects were partially offset by less favorable product price realizations as compared to the spot market prices used in the lls blended crack spread.
based on changes in the market indicators shown above and our refinery throughputs, we estimate a positive impact of $2.33 billion for 2017 compared to 2016 on refining & marketing segment income from operations. the market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of lcm inventory valuation adjustments, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had an estimated negative impact on refining & marketing segment income from operations of $1.35 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. the significant elements of the negative impact were unfavorable product price realizations and unfavorable crude acquisition costs relative to the market indicators.
refinery direct operating costs decreased $0.17 per barrel in 2017 compared to 2016. the decrease in 2017 includes an $0.11 per barrel decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs resulting from lower turnaround activity at our garyville and robinson refineries partially offset by higher activity at our catlettsburg refinery.
we purchase rins to satisfy a portion of our rfs2 compliance. our expenses associated with purchased rins were $457 million in 2017 and $288 million in 2016. the increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher weighted average rin costs driven by higher market prices for purchased rins and increases in the number of rins purchased.

(a)   based on calendar-day capacity, which is an annual average that includes down time for planned maintenance and other normal operating activities.
(d)   includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs.
retail segment revenues increased $4.52 billion. the majority of this increase is due to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1, 2018, which added company-owned and operated retail locations, which are included in speedway fuel sales, and direct dealer locations. the existing retail business also saw a $1.18 billion increase in fuel and merchandise sales. total fuel sales increased $5.21 billion primarily due to an increase in speedway fuel sales volumes of 494 million gallons, the addition of direct dealer fuel sales of 644 million gallons and an increase in average gasoline and distillate selling prices of $0.37 per gallon. merchandise sales increased $339 million. the increases in speedway fuel sales and merchandise sales as well as the addition of sales to direct dealers were primarily due to the acquisition of andeavor. these increases were partially offset by our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under asc 606 prospectively from january 1, 2018, which resulted in a decrease in retail segment revenues of $844 million in 2018. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes 2 and 3 for additional information on recently adopted accounting standards.
retail segment income from operations increased $299 million primarily due to contributions from the retail operations acquired in the andeavor acquisition. for locations owned prior to the andeavor acquisition, increased gasoline and distillate and merchandise margins were more than offset by increased operating expenses.
retail segment income from operations decreased $4 million. segment income in 2016 includes a $25 million non-cash benefit related to the reversal of the company's lcm inventory reserve, which was recorded in 2015. excluding the lcm inventory benefit recognized in 2016, the increase in segment results for 2017 was primarily due to a full year of contributions from speedway's travel center joint venture formed in the fourth quarter 2016 and lower operating expense, partially offset by lower merchandise margin and lower gains from asset sales.
(a)   we adopted asc 606 (revenue from contracts with customers), as of january 1, 2018, and elected to report certain taxes on a net basis. we applied the standard using the modified retrospective method, and, therefore, comparative information continues to reflect certain taxes on a gross basis.
(b)   results related to refining logistics and fuels distribution dropdown into mplx are presented in the midstream segment prospectively from february 1, 2018. prior periods are not adjusted as these entities were not considered a business prior to february 1, 2018.
(a)   on owned common-carrier pipelines, excluding equity method investments.
(c)   includes amounts related to unconsolidated equity method investments on a 100 percent basis.
on february 1, 2018, we completed the dropdown of our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to mplx, which is reported in our midstream segment. refining logistics contains the integrated tank farm assets that support mpc's refining operations. fuels distribution is structured to provide a broad range of scheduling and marketing services as mpc's agent. these new businesses were reported in the midstream segment prospectively from february 1, 2018. no effect was given to prior periods as these entities were not considered businesses prior to february 1, 2018.
midstream segment revenue and income from operations increased $2.90 billion and $1.41 billion, respectively. revenue increased $1.94 billion primarily due to fees charged for fuels distribution and refining logistics services following the february 1, 2018 dropdown to mplx in addition to services provided by andx following the acquisition of andeavor on october 1, 2018. revenues also increased by approximately $502 million due to asc 606 gross ups. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 3 for additional information.
midstream segment revenue and income from operations increased $675 million and $291 million, respectively, primarily due to increased revenue from higher natural gas and ngl gathering, processing and fractionation volumes and changes in natural gas and ngl prices. segment results also benefited from the first quarter 2017 acquisitions of the ozark pipeline and our ownership interest in the bakken pipeline system. the comparison for 2017 and 2016 also reflects the absence of any revenues for the terminal services provided to the refining & marketing segment in the first quarter of 2016 versus the inclusion of revenues for these services in the first quarter of 2017. these assets were not considered a business prior to april 1, 2016, and therefore, no financial results for these assets were available from which to recast first quarter 2016 midstream segment results.

(a)   corporate and other unallocated items consists primarily of mpc's corporate administrative expenses and costs related to certain non-operating assets, except for corporate overhead expenses attributable to mplx and andx, which are included in the midstream segment. corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to the refining &amp; marketing and retail segments.
(b)   2018 and 2017 includes mpc's share of gains from the the sale of assets remaining from the canceled sandpiper pipeline project. 2016 includes impairments of goodwill and equity method investments. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes16 and 17.
corporate and other unallocated expenses increased $137 million in 2018 compared to 2017 largely due to increased costs and expenses for the combined company after the andeavor acquisition on october 1, 2018.

non-gaap financial measures management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with gaap ("non-gaap"). we believe these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to its most comparable gaap financial measure, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. these measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. the non-gaap financial measures we use are as follows:
income from equity method investments                                                               (74   )             (69   )              (5   )
(a)   2018 and 2017 margins and expenses do not reflect any results from the 41 travel centers contributed to pfj southeast, whereas they are reflected in the 2016 information. our share of the net results from the joint venture is reflected in income from equity method investments.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.69 billion at december 31, 2018 compared to $3.01 billion at december 31, 2017. net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table.
operating activities                   $6,158              $6,612              $4,017

net cash provided by operating activities decreased $454 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to an unfavorable change in working capital of $2.28 billion partially offset by an increase in operating results. net cash provided by operating activities increased $2.60 billion in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased operating results and favorable changes in working capital of $1.74 billion compared to 2017. the above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt.
for 2018, changes in working capital were a net $340 million use of cash, primarily due to the effect of decreases in energy commodity prices on working capital. accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower crude oil payable prices. inventories decreased primarily due to a decrease in crude and refined product inventories. current receivables decreased primarily due to lower crude oil receivable prices. all of these effects exclude the working capital acquired in connection with the acquisition of andeavor.
for 2017, changes in working capital were a net $1.94 billion source of cash, primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices on working capital. accounts payable increased primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes and prices; current receivables increased primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product receivable prices and volumes; and inventories decreased primarily due to lower crude oil inventory volumes.
for 2016, changes in working capital were a net $200 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices on working capital. accounts payable increased primarily due to higher crude oil payable prices; current
cash flows used in investing activities increased $4.27 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 and increased $431 million in 2017 compared to 2016.

financing activities were a source of cash of $222 million in 2018 and uses of cash of $1.09 billion in 2017 and $1.29 billion in 2016.
•   long-term debt borrowings and repayments, including debt issuance costs, were a net $5.36 billion source of cash in 2018 compared to a $2.24 billion source of cash in 2017 and a $1.42 billion use of cash in 2016. during 2018, mplx issued $7.75 billion of senior notes, redeemed $750 million of senior notes, borrowed and repaid $4.1 billion under the mplx term loan, and borrowed and repaid $1.41 billion and $1.92 billion, respectively, under the mplx credit agreement. in addition, mpc redeemed $600 million of senior notes. during 2017, mplx issued $2.25 billion of senior notes, borrowed $505 million under the mplx bank revolving credit agreement, repaid the remaining $250 million under the mplx term loan agreement and we repaid the remaining $200 million balance under the mpc term loan agreement. during 2016, mplx used proceeds from its issuance of the mplx preferred units to repay amounts outstanding under the mplx bank revolving credit facility and mpc chose to prepay $500 million under its term loan. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for additional information on our long-term debt.
•   cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $3.29 billion in 2018, $2.37 billion in 2017, and $197 million in 2016 associated with the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors. see the "capital requirements" section for further discussion of our stock repurchases.
•   cash used in dividend payments totaled $954 million in 2018, $773 million in 2017 and $719 million in 2016. the increase in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in our base dividend in addition to a net increase in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding due to issuances related to the andeavor acquisition, partially offset by share repurchases. the increase in 2017 was due to an increase in our base dividend, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of share repurchases. dividends per share were $1.84 in 2018, $1.52 in 2017 and $1.36 in 2016.
•   distributions to noncontrolling interests increased $209 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and $152 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in mplx's distribution per common unit. in 2018, distributions to
noncontrolling interests also included andx's distribution per common unit paid in the fourth quarter subsequent to the acquisition of andeavor on october 1, 2018.
•   cash proceeds from the issuance of mplx common units were $473 million in 2017 and $776 million in 2016. cash proceeds from the issuance of mplx preferred units was $984 million in 2016. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 4 for further discussion of mplx.

(a)   outstanding borrowings include $32 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility. excludes mplx's $2.25 billion bank revolving credit facility, which had no borrowings and $3 million of letters of credit outstanding as of december 31, 2018 and andx's $2.10 billion bank revolving credit facilities, which had $1.25 billion outstanding as of december 31, 2018.
because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, including a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.
on november 15, 2018, mplx issued $2.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering, consisting of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.800 percent unsecured senior notes due february 2029 and $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.500 percent unsecured senior notes due february 2049. on december 10, 2018, a portion of the net proceeds from the offering was used to redeem the $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500 percent unsecured notes due february 2023 issued by mplx and markwest. these notes were redeemed at 101.833 percent of the principal amount, plus the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $60 million. the remaining net proceeds have or will be used to repay borrowings under mplx's revolving credit facility and intercompany loan agreement with mpc and for general partnership purposes.
on february 8, 2018, mplx issued $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering, consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 percent unsecured senior notes due march 2023, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.000 percent unsecured senior notes due march 2028, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500 percent unsecured senior notes due april 2038, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.700 percent unsecured senior notes due april 2048, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.900 percent unsecured senior notes due april 2058. on february 8, 2018, $4.1 billion of the net proceeds were used to repay the 364-day term-loan facility, which was used to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the dropdown of refining logistics assets and distribution services to mplx. the remaining proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under mplx's revolving credit facility and intercompany loan agreement with mpc and for general partnership purposes.
commercial paper - we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2 billion in commercial paper outstanding, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. we do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities. at december 31, 2018, we had no amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.
mpc bank revolving credit facilities - on august 28, 2018, in connection with the andeavor acquisition, we entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of lenders to replace mpc's previous five-year $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility due in 2022 and our previous 364-day $1 billion bank revolving agreement that expired in july 2018. the new credit agreements, which became effective october 1, 2018, provide for a $5 billion five-year revolving credit facility that expires in 2023 and a $1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility that expires in 2019. the financial covenants and the interest rate terms contained in the new credit agreements are substantially the same as those contained in the previous bank revolving credit facilities. there were no borrowings and approximately $32 million of letters of credit outstanding under these facilities at december 31, 2018.
trade receivables facility - our trade receivables facility has a borrowing capacity of $750 million (depending on the amount of our eligible domestic trade accounts receivable) and a maturity date of july 19, 2019. as of december 31, 2018, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $750 million. there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2018. availability under our trade receivables facility is primarily a function of refined product selling prices.
mplx credit agreement - on july 21, 2017, mplx entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace the existing $2 billion five-year bank revolving credit facility with a $2.25 billion five-year bank revolving credit facility with a maturity date of july 2022 ("mplx credit agreement"). at december 31, 2018, mplx had no outstanding borrowings and $3 million of letters of credit outstanding under the bank revolving credit facility, resulting in total unused loan availability of approximately $2.25 billion.
andx credit agreements - through the andeavor acquisition on october 1, 2018, we acquired the general partner and 156 million units of andx. andx is party to a $1.1 billion revolving credit agreement and a $1.0 billion dropdown credit agreement both of which expire in january 2021 (together, the "andx credit agreements"). as of december 31, 2018, andx had approximately $1.25 billion outstanding borrowings under the andx credit agreements, resulting in total unused loan availability of $855 million.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 19 for further discussion of our debt.
the mpc credit agreements contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. the financial covenant included in the mpc credit agreements requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization (as defined in the mpc credit agreements) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. other covenants restrict us and/or certain of our subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the mpc credit agreements, including a ratio of consolidated net debt to total capitalization of 0.19 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the mpc credit agreements.
the mplx credit agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type. the mplx credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires mplx to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to consolidated ebitda (both as defined in the mplx credit agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). consolidated ebitda is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. other covenants restrict mplx and/or certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. as of december 31, 2018, mplx was in compliance with the covenants contained in the mplx credit agreement, including a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda of 3.80 to 1.0.
the andx credit agreements contain certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a financial covenant that requires andx to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the andx credit agreements) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 for the prior four fiscal quarters (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). consolidated ebitda used to calculate the consolidated leverage ratio is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. the covenants also restrict, among other things, andx's ability and/or the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to incur debt, create liens on assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. as of december 31, 2018, andx was in compliance with the covenants contained in the andx credit agreements, including a consolidated leverage ratio of 3.72 to 1.0.
as disclosed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements, we expect the adoption of the lease accounting standard update to result in the recognition of a significant lease obligation. the mpc bank revolving credit facility, the mplx credit agreement and the andx credit agreements contain provisions under which the effects of the new accounting standard are not recognized for purposes of financial covenant calculations.
our intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. as of february 1, 2019, the credit ratings on our, mplx's and andx's senior unsecured debt are as follows.
fitch                   bbb (stable outlook)
fitch                   bbb- (positive outlook)
standard &amp; poor's   bbb- (positive watch)
fitch                   bbb- (stable outlook)
the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.
none of the mpc credit agreements, the mplx credit agreement, the andx credit agreements or our trade receivables facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. however, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under such agreements. in addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment-grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services or other agreements.
capital requirements for information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the "capital spending" section.
share repurchases since january 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $18.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $13.10 billion of our common stock, leaving $4.9 billion available for repurchases as of december 31, 2018. under these authorizations, we have acquired 293 million shares at an average cost per share of $44.60. as part of our strategic actions to enhance shareholder value, for the year ended december 31, 2018, cash proceeds received from dropdowns to mplx during the year were used in part to repurchase $3.29 billion of our common stock. the table below summarizes our total share repurchases. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 9 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.
we may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through rule 10b5-1 plans. the timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.
capital lease obligations(b)                                                        897                  65                 127                   148                   557

capital spending the 2019 capital investment plan for mpc, mplx and andx and capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below. mpc's capital investment plan for 2019 totals approximately $2.8 billion for capital projects and investments, excluding mplx, andx, capitalized interest and acquisitions. mpc's 2019 capital investment plan includes all of the planned capital spending for refining & marketing, retail and corporate as well as a portion of the planned capital investments in midstream. the remainder of the planned capital spending for midstream reflects the capital investment plans for mplx and andx. we continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant.
capital expenditures and investments:(a)
(a)   capital expenditures include changes in capital accruals.
(b)   includes capitalized interest of $80 million, $55 million and $63 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the 2019 capital investment plan excludes capitalized interest.
refining & marketing the refining & marketing segment's forecasted 2019 capital spending and investments is approximately $1.8 billion. this amount includes approximately $1.02 billion of growth capital focused on refinery optimization, production of higher value products, increased capacity to upgrade residual fuel oil and expanded export capacity. investing to enhance margins, we will continue our disciplined high-return investments in resid upgrading capacity and the ability to produce more diesel. we also plan to continue investing in domestic light products supply placement flexibility, as well as increasing our export capacity. sustaining capital is approximately $730 million, which includes approximately $260 million related to regulatory spending for tier 3 gasoline.
major capital projects completed over the last three years have prepared us to increase our diesel production, process light crude oil, increase our export capabilities and meet the upcoming transportation fuel regulatory mandate (tier 3 fuel standards). in addition, the star investment project intended to transform our galveston bay refinery into a world-class refining complex is progressing according to plan and is scheduled to complete in 2022.
retail the retail segment's 2019 capital forecast of approximately $500 million is focused on conversion of recently acquired locations to the speedway brand and systems, growth in existing and new markets, dealer sites, commercial fueling/diesel expansion, food service through store remodels and high quality acquisitions.
major capital projects over the last three years included building new store locations, remodeling and rebuilding existing locations in core markets and building out our network of commercial fueling lane locations to capitalize on diesel demand growth. we also invested in the conversion, remodel and maintenance of stores acquired in 2014.
midstream mplx's capital investment plan includes $2.2 billion of organic growth capital and approximately $200 million of maintenance capital.this growth plan includes the addition of approximately 765 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity at five gas processing plants, two in the marcellus basin and three in the southwest, which expands mplx's processing capacity in the permian basin and the stack shale play of oklahoma. the growth plan also includes the addition of approximately 100 mbpd of fractionation capacity in the marcellus and utica basins, continued expansion of mplx's marine fleet and other projects including the permian long-haul crude oil, natural gas and ngl pipelines as well as export facility projects which will further enhance our full value chain capture.
major capital projects over the last three years included investments for the development of natural gas and gas liquids infrastructure to support mplx's producer customers, primarily in the marcellus and utica shale regions, development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects, including a build-out of utica shale infrastructure in connection with the cornerstone pipeline, a butane cavern in robinson, illinois, and a tank farm expansion in texas city, texas.
andx's capital investment plan includes $600 million of organic growth capital and approximately $100 million of maintenance capital. the growth plan includes the construction of additional crude storage capacity for unloading of marine vessels, the construction of a crude gathering system to provide connectivity to multiple long-haul pipelines and a pipeline interconnect project designed to provide direct connectivity between certain mpc refineries.
the remaining midstream segment's forecasted 2019 capital spend, excluding mplx and andx, is approximately $500 million which primarily relates to investments in equity affiliate pipelines, including our expected investments in the gray oak pipeline, a new pipeline spanning from the west texas permian basin to the gulf coast which is expected to be in service by the end of 2019.
corporate and other the 2019 capital forecast includes approximately $60 million to support corporate activities. major projects over the last three years included an expansion project for our corporate headquarters and upgrades to information technology systems.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.
we have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. in conjunction with the spinoff, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to marathon oil. these arrangements are described in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 25.
transactions with related parties we believe that transactions with related parties were conducted on terms comparable to those with unaffiliated parties. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 7 for discussion of activity with related parties.
environmental matters and compliance costs we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. if these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. however, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.
legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. the extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. for additional information see item 1a. risk factors.
our environmental expenditures, including non-regulatory expenditures, for each of the last three years were:
capital                           $380              $343              $302
(a)   based on the american petroleum institute's definition of environmental expenditures.
we accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. as environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.
new or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. we believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.
our environmental capital expenditures accounted for ten percent, twelve percent and eleven percent of capital expenditures, for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, excluding acquisitions. our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $420 million, or 7 percent, of total planned capital expenditures in 2019. actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. the amount of expenditures in 2019 is also dependent upon the resolution of the matters described in item 3. legal proceedings, which may require us to complete additional projects and increase our actual environmental capital and operating expenditures.
for more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see item 1. business - environmental matters, item 1a. risk factors and item 3. legal proceedings.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
fair value estimates fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. there are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. the income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. the cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. this is often referred to as current replacement cost. the cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.
the fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•   level 1 - observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
•   level 2 - observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. these are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.
•   level 3 - unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. the assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. we use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.
•   assessment of impairment of equity method investments;
•   recorded values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions; and
impairment assessments of long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions including:
•   future margins on products produced and sold. our estimates of future product margins are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews.
•   discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. we apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. this discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. a higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.
•   future capital requirements. these are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts.
the need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a poor outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, a significant reduction in natural gas or ngls processed, a significant reduction in refining or retail fuel margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment.
long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. for purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for refining & marketing segment assets, company-owned convenience store locations for retail segment assets, and the plant level or pipeline system level for midstream segment assets. if the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value.
unlike long-lived assets, goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. at december 31, 2018, we had a total of $20.18 billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including $16.31 billion that was preliminarily recognized as a result of the andeavor acquisition and remains subject to finalization within one year of the october 1, 2018 acquisition date.
for the reporting units included in our annual impairment testing for 2018, the analysis resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by percentages ranging from approximately 14 percent to 4,608 percent. the reporting unit with fair value exceeding its carrying value by approximately 14 percent has goodwill of $228 million at december 31, 2018. an increase of one percentage to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge as of november 30, 2018. significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units' fair value included estimates of future cash flows. if estimates for future cash flows, which are impacted by commodity prices and producers' production plans, were to decline, the overall reporting units' fair value would decrease, resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges. fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. as a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.
equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee's inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. at december 31, 2018, we had $5.90 billion of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
an estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. that is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 14 for additional information on our equity method investments. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 16 for additional information on our goodwill and intangibles.
acquisitions in accounting for business combinations, acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. a significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities. we use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for valuation assistance.
the fair value of assets and liabilities, including contingent consideration, as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity-specific differences. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the projected results used to determine fair value.
see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 5 for additional information on our acquisitions. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17 for additional information on fair value measurements.
derivatives we record all derivative instruments at fair value. substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value. fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 17. additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
variable interest entities we evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a vie. our interests in a vie are referred to as variable interests. variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the vie's assets. when we conclude that we hold an interest in a vie we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. a primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie. this controlling financial interest is evidenced by both (a) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie. we consolidate any vie when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. we must disclose the nature of any interests in a vie that is not consolidated.
significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a vie and in evaluating our interest in a vie. we use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a vie. we evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. we evaluate our interests in a vie to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. we use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the vie, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. we continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.
changes in the design or nature of the activities of a vie, or our involvement with a vie, may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity's status as a vie and/or our status as the primary beneficiary. such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization. this could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary, which would have a significant impact on our financial statements.
variable interest entities are discussed in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6.
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:
•   the mortality table used in determining future plan obligations.
we utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. we have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. the selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. in determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuaries' discount rate models. these models calculate an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using yield curves derived from aa or higher bond yields. the yield curves represent a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. the bonds used have an average rating of aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only non-callable bonds are included. outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding.
of the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. decreasing the discount rates of 4.21 percent for our pension plans and 4.26 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $69 million and $31 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $8 million and $1 million, respectively.
the long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 42 percent equity securities and 58 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan), past performance and other factors. certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. in addition, our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. we used the 6.15 percent long-term rate of return to determine our 2018 defined benefit pension expense. after evaluating activity in the capital markets, along with the current and projected plan investments, we did not change the asset rate of return for our primary plan from 6.15 percent effective for 2019. decreasing the 6.15 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $4 million.
compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans.
we utilized the 2018 mortality tables from the u.s. society of actuaries.

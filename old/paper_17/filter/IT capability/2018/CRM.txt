item 1a.   risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and financial condition.
risks related to our business and industry if our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the internet are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data, our data or our it systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant reputational harm, legal exposure and liabilities, or a negative financial impact.
our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and personally identifiable information. while we have security measures in place to protect our customers and our customers' customers' data, our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following:
•   third party attempts to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers' data, our data or our it systems;
•   efforts by individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states;
•   cyber-attacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate;
•   vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings;
•   vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on;
•   vulnerabilities existing within newly acquired or integrated technologies and infrastructures;
•   attacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners, or customers; and
•   employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems.
these risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. our board of directors, audit committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cyber-security policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as periodic updates on cyber-security events. although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security. for example, our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following:
•   frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage it systems and infrastructure, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, possibly resulting in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques;
•   the continued evolution of our internal it systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our it systems;
•   authorization by our customers to third-party technology providers to access their customer data, which may lead to our customers' inability to protect their data that is stored on our servers; and
•   our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.
in the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts and have experienced other security incidents. to date, such identified security events have not been material or significant to us, including to our reputation or business operations, or had a material financial impact, but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant.
a security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our it systems or data, or our customers' systems or data, including intellectual property, proprietary, sensitive, or other confidential information. a security breach could also result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal and financial exposure and liability. finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software, may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs, such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities.
defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability.
because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. we have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. such defects could also create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data. in addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. as we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies to meet the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses. as a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. we could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.
any interruptions or delays in services from third-parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.
we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the united states and other countries. we also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. any damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future. as we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase. interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable.
we use a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements. for many of our offerings, our production environment and customers' data are replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. they may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.
these hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services.
if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business. as we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we may move or transfer our data and our customers' data. despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business.
privacy concerns and laws such as the european union's general data protection regulation, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business.
regulation related to the provision of services over the internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. in some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the european union's ("eu") general data protection regulation that took effect in may 2018, impose new obligations directly on salesforce as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. in addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the california consumer privacy act ("ccpa") which will take effect in january 2020, continue to evolve and could expose us to further regulatory burdens. further, laws such as the european union's proposed e-privacy regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals' online activities.
although we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these developments, such as gdpr and ccpa readiness, these laws may require us to make additional changes to our services to enable salesforce or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance. these new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. these and other requirements could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers' ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. for example, ongoing legal challenges in europe to the mechanisms allowing companies to transfer personal data from the european economic area to the united states could result in further limitations on the ability to transfer data across borders, particularly if governments are unable or unwilling to reach new or maintain existing agreements that support cross-border data transfers, such as the eu-u.s. and swiss-u.s. privacy shield framework. additionally, certain countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business.
in addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, such as truste. if we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business.
furthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may cause concerns regarding data privacy and may cause our customers or our customers' customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.
our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business.
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from subscriptions to our crm enterprise cloud computing application services, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. our efforts to expand our services beyond the crm market may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. the markets for certain of our offerings, including our einstein artificial intelligence and data integration offerings, remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our efforts, and related investments, will ever result in significant revenue for us. in addition, we may be required to continuously enhance our artificial intelligence offerings so that quality recommendations can be provided to our customers. further, the introduction of significant platform changes and upgrades, including our lightning platform and customer 360 platform, may not succeed and early stage interest and adoption of such new services may not result in long term success or significant revenue for us.
additionally, if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internet-related and other technology trends and developments early enough, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed.
if we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. the success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature, service or enhancement by customers, administrators and developers, as well as our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our service offerings and
develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. in addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, app development platform and database technologies, as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems. we may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses. any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.
as we acquire and invest in companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock.
as part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. in particular, in may 2018, we completed our largest acquisition to date of mulesoft, for $6.4 billion, which we are continuing to integrate. acquisitions and other transactions, arrangements, and investments involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including:
•   potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all;
•   difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel;
•   diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;
•   the potential entry into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;
•   potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;
•   differences between our values and those of our acquired companies;
•   difficulties in re-training key employees of acquired companies and integrating them into our organizational structure and corporate culture;
•   difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure;
•   inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;
•   inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;
•   changes to customer relationships or customer perception of the acquired business as a result of the acquisition;
•   challenges converting and forecasting the acquired company's revenue recognition policies including subscription-based revenues and revenues based on the transfer of control as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables;
•   difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis;
•   augmenting the acquired technologies and platforms to the levels that are consistent with our brand and reputation;
•   potential for acquired products to impact the profitability of existing products;
•   potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings or recognize the benefits of our investment;
•   increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services;
•   potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;
•   challenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments;
•   unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into our existing technology;
•   negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation;
•   additional stock-based compensation; the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue;
•   delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;
•   ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company may negatively impact our results of operations;
•   in the case of foreign acquisitions, challenges caused by integrating operations over distance, and across different languages, cultures and political environments;
•   currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; and
•   the tax effects and costs of any such acquisitions including the related integration into our tax structure and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our future tax assets or liabilities.
any of these risks could harm our business. in addition, to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. for example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock.
industry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business.
our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers' use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. for example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. if we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. in addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry (pci) data security standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results.
further, in some cases, industry-specific laws, regionally-specific, or product-specific laws, regulations, or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. the interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations, and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. for example, there are various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the telephone consumer protection act (tcpa) and related federal communication commission (fcc) orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. we have been, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the tcpa. a determination that we or our customers violated the tcpa or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business.
supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.
we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. we anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. the additional investments we
are making will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term.
we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems. if the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted.
our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures, and our utilization of real estate. if we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the fair value of our common stock could decline.
the market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.
the market for enterprise applications and platform services requires continuous innovation and is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology and low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service. additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms.
our current competitors include:
•   vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;
•   software companies that provide their product or service free of charge, and only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality;
•   internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers' it departments);
•   marketing vendors, which may be specialized in advertising, targeting, messaging, or campaign automation;
•   integration software vendors, integration service providers and api management providers;
•   traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers' current infrastructure or as hosted services;
•   iot platforms from large companies that have existing relationships with hardware and software companies; and
some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, personnel, and other resources. in addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. we also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers' demands. these competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements or provide competitive pricing. as a result, even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. for all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business.
our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties.
the internet's infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. this infrastructure is run by a series of independent third-party organizations that work together to
provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned numbers and names (icann) and the internet assigned numbers authority (iana), now under the stewardship of icann.
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future. these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage or result in fragmentation of the internet, resulting in multiple separate internets. these scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internet-based services. any resulting interruptions in our services or the ability of our customers to access our services could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.
in addition, certain countries have implemented (or may implement) legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet, including the ability of internet service providers to limit access to specific websites or content. these actions could potentially limit or interrupt access to our services from certain countries or internet service providers, impede our growth, result in the loss of potential or existing customers and harm our business.
we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments including partial or complete loss of invested capital. significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio, including changes in the market prices of our investments in public companies and impairments, could negatively impact our financial results.
we invest in early-to-late stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and may not realize a return on our strategic investments. many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. the financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. the capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen.
further, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data.
upon adoption of asu 2016-01 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we are now required to record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held equity investments through the consolidated statement of operations. as a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of operations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held equity investments and the valuation and timing of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. this volatility has been and could continue to be material to our results in any given quarter based on market conditions and events and may cause our stock price to decline. while historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations which affect our strategic investments portfolio.
all of our investments, especially our investments in privately held companies, are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital.
our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially.
our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. for example, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. as a result, our fiscal first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.
additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:
•   our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers' requirements;
•   the attrition rates for our services;
•   the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;
•   the length of the sales cycle for our services;
•   new product and service introductions by our competitors;
•   our success in selling our services to large enterprises;
•   our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments;
•   general economic or geopolitical conditions, which may adversely affect either our customers' ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions or upgrade their services, or delay a prospective customer's purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates;
•   variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our cloud subscription and support offerings, including the timing of software license sales and sales offerings that include an on-premise software element for which the revenue allocated to that deliverable is recognized upfront;
•   the seasonality of our sales cycle, including software license sales, and timing of contract execution and the corresponding impact on revenue recognized at a point in time;
•   changes in our pricing policies and terms of contracts, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition;
•   changes in payment terms and the timing of customer payments and payment defaults by customers;
•   changes in unearned revenue and the remaining performance obligation, due to seasonality, the timing of and compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter, average contract term, the timing of license software revenue recognition, or fluctuations due to foreign currency movements, all of which may impact implied growth rates;
•   the seasonality of our customers' businesses, especially commerce cloud customers, including retailers and branded manufacturers;
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates such as with respect to the british pound;
•   the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business;
•   the cost, timing and management effort for the introduction of new features to our services;
•   the costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses;
•   expenses related to our real estate, our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion;
•   timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services;
•   extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;
•   income tax effects, including the impact of changes in u.s. federal and state and international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals;
•   the timing of payroll and other withholding tax expenses, which are triggered by the payment of bonuses and when employees exercise their vested stock awards;
•   changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which would impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities;
•   conditions, particularly sudden changes, in the financial markets, which have impacted and may continue to impact the value of and liquidity of our investment portfolio;
•   changes in the fair value of our strategic investments in early-to-late stage privately held and public companies, which could negatively and materially impact our financial results, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations;
•   equity issuances, including as consideration in acquisitions;
•   the timing of stock awards to employees and the related adverse financial statement impact of having to expense those stock awards on a straight-line basis over their vesting schedules;
•   evolving regulations of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations;
•   regulatory compliance costs; and
•   the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations, for example, the adoption of accounting standards update no. 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)" ("asu 2016-02"), which includes the accounting for lease assets and lease liabilities.
many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. if we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common
stock could decline. in addition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline.
if we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline.
due to the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services, the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models, and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. we plan our expense levels and investment on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations. a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. as a result, we expect that our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future, and we may not be able to provide continued operating margin expansion, which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
sales to customers outside the united states expose us to risks inherent in international operations.
we sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. the risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the united states or those that can affect international operations generally, include:
•   localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;
•   regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors;
•   pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, particularly in europe, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;
•   evolving domestic and international tax environments;
•   liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, which could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations;
•   foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to our operating results;
•   compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, data transfer, storage and protection, and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur;
•   vetting and monitoring our third-party resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation;
•   uncertainty regarding regulation, currency, tax, and operations resulting from the brexit vote that could disrupt trade, the sale of our services and commerce, and movement of our people between the united kingdom, european union, and locations;
•   changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate;
•   regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers' data across international borders, which grow more complex as we scale and expand into new markets;
•   treatment of revenue from international sources, intellectual property considerations and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws and being liable for paying withholding income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions;
•   different pricing environments;
•   difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;
•   natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or security breaches; and
•   regional economic and political conditions.
any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. the above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed.
because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.
we generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. as a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. any such decline, however, will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and potential changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.
if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue could decline and our business may suffer. if we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. in addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or switch to lower cost offerings of our services. it is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers' spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes and deteriorating general economic conditions.
our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services.
if customers do not renew their subscriptions, do not purchase additional features or enhanced subscriptions or if attrition rates increase, our business could be harmed.
if third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed.
our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. in addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner access to their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our business.
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies and the euro versus the pound sterling.
we conduct our business in the following regions: the americas, europe and asia pacific. the expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, including data center expansion, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations primarily in british pound sterling, euro, japanese yen, canadian dollar and australian dollar against the u.s. dollar as well as the euro against the pound sterling. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. the fluctuations of
currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. additionally, global political events, including the united kingdom's 2016 vote in favor of exiting the european union, or "brexit," and similar geopolitical developments, fluctuating commodity prices and trade tariff developments, have caused global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to predict our future results and earnings accurately. although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
as more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.
as we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. in this market segment, the customer's decision to use our services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as education regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations to prospective customers with international operations. in addition, larger customers and governmental entities may demand more configuration, integration services and features. as a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.
pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for subscriptions to our existing and future service offerings may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customers. our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategies may harm our business.
for large enterprise customers, professional services may also be performed by a third party or a combination of our own staff and a third-party. our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. if a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third-party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer's dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. in addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.
we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.
we are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. these may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, and other matters.
the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. we have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.
in addition, we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third-party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.
our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. for example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. in addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.
any adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. in addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter.
any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, cause us to incur significant expenses and harm our business.
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. while we have many u.s. patents and pending u.s. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. in addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the u.s. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available. the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the u.s., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. also, our involvement in standard setting activity or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property.
we may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. furthermore, any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources and harm our business.
our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands.
we believe that the brand identities we have developed have significantly contributed to the success of our business. maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. our brand strength will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services, and features securely, reliably and in a manner that enhances our customers' success. in order to maintain and enhance our brands, we may be required to make substantial investments that may later prove to be unsuccessful. in addition, our services, including ai predictions, may be used by our customers for purposes inconsistent with our company values, which may harm our brand.  as with many innovations, ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business. further, the development of ai presents emerging ethical issues. if we enable or offer ai solutions that are controversial, due to their impact, or perceived impact, on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability.
in addition, positions we take on social issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability and equality, and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could adversely impact our relationships with our customers. in addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand.
if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
we may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth.
our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our co-chief executive officers. from time to time, there may be changes in our executive
management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business.
the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and internet-related services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. we have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring, developing, integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. these difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. these difficulties may potentially be further amplified by the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area, where our headquarters are located. if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
in addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture of ohana, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition and a sense of family. as our organization grows and expands globally, and as employees' workplace expectations develop, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. this could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees or our reputation with customers and could negatively impact our future growth.
any failure in our delivery of high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.
our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. in addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position.
periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth.
we periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. any such future sales organization changes may result in a temporary reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth. in addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth.
unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities may impact our financial results.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various jurisdictions outside of the united states. our income tax obligations are generally determined based on our business operations in these jurisdictions. significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes. our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in the earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions, changes in accounting principles and tax laws in jurisdictions where we operate. any changes, ambiguity, or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities.
as our business continues to grow and if we become more profitable, we anticipate that our income tax obligations could significantly increase. if our existing tax credits and net operating loss carry-forwards become fully utilized, we may be unable to offset or otherwise mitigate our tax obligations to the same extent as in prior years. this could have a material impact to our future cash flows or operating results.
in addition, recent global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses, including certain approaches of addressing taxation of digital economy recently proposed or enacted by the organization for economic co-operation and development, the european commission or certain major jurisdictions where we operate might have a material impact to our business and future cash flow from operating activities, or future financial results. we are also subject to tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. while we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. in addition, our operations may
change, which may impact our tax liabilities. as our brand becomes increasingly recognizable both domestically and internationally, our tax planning structure and corresponding profile may be subject to increased scrutiny and if we are perceived negatively, we may experience brand or reputational harm.
we may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including acquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results.
our debt service obligations and operating lease commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations.
we have a substantial level of debt, including the 2023 and 2028 senior notes we issued in april 2018 ("senior notes") due april 2023 and april 2028, the loan we assumed when we purchased an office building located at 50 fremont street in san francisco, california ("50 fremont") due june 2023, the $500.0 million term loan to finance our acquisition of mulesoft, due may 2021 ("2021 term loan") and capital lease arrangements. additionally, we have significant contractual commitments, including operating lease arrangements, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, as well as a financing obligation for a leased facility of which we are deemed the owner for accounting purposes. in april 2018, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility under which we can draw down up to $1.0 billion. maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could:
•   impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes;
•   make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.
our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. we will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business.
in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreements impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings. any required repayment of our debt or revolving credit facility as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business.
new lease accounting guidance requires that we record operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet in fiscal 2020, which will result in an increase in both our assets and financing obligations. the implementation of this guidance may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all as this new guidance will result in a higher financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheet.
weakened global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.
our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. the united states and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. these
economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. in addition, geopolitical developments, such as potential trade wars, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and could adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results.
natural disasters and other events beyond our control could materially adversely affect us.
natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other events beyond our control. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our research and development activities, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area. because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event.
climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate related risks, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted. access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices, data centers, vendors, customers or other stakeholders, is a priority. any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. for example, our california headquarters are projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity due to climate change. climate related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on u.s. critical infrastructure, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third party suppliers, or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.
current and future accounting pronouncements and other financial reporting standards, especially but not only concerning revenue recognition, cost capitalization and lease accounting, may negatively impact our financial results.
we regularly monitor our compliance with applicable financial reporting standards and review new pronouncements and drafts thereof that are relevant to us. as a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we have been required to change our accounting policies, particularly concerning revenue recognition and the capitalized incremental costs to obtain a customer contract, to alter our operational policies, to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, and to adjust our published financial statements. we will have similar requirements related to future accounting pronouncements, such as lease accounting. such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and operating profit target, which may negatively impact our financial results.
our contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. in addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales and operating results.
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.
our solutions are subject to export and import controls, including the commerce department's export administration regulations, u.s. customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the treasury department's office of foreign assets control. if we fail to comply with these u.s. export control laws and import laws we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. furthermore, the u.s.
export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to u.s. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. even though we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to u.s. sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations, our solutions could be provisioned to those targets or provided by our resellers despite such precautions. any such sales could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
risks related to our common stock the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation.
the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. factors affecting the market price of our common stock include:
•   variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities, unearned revenue, remaining performance obligation, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics and non-financial metrics, such as transaction usage volumes and other usage metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;
•   variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business;
•   forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to, for example, future revenue, unearned revenue, remaining performance obligation, cash flows from operating activities and earnings per share;
•   changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;
•   announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;
•   announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors;
•   announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;
•   the coverage of our common stock by the financial media, including television, radio and press reports and blogs;
•   recruitment or departure of key personnel;
•   disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems;
•   the economy as a whole, geopolitical conditions, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers;
•   trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock;
•   the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition or a capital raising transaction; and
•   issuance of debt or other convertible securities.
in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. if we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. these provisions among other things:
•   permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors;
•   provide that directors may only be removed with the approval of holders of 66 2/3 percent of our outstanding capital stock;
•   require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
•   prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;
•   establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.
in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock.

our customer success platform - including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, digital commerce, community management, industry-specific solutions, analytics, integration solutions, application development, iot integration, collaborative productivity tools, our appexchange, which is our enterprise cloud marketplace, and our professional cloud services - provides the tools customers need to succeed in a digital world. key elements of our strategy include:
•   reduce customer attrition;
•   expand into new horizontal markets;
•   extend go-to-market capabilities;
•   ensure strong customer adoption; and
•   encourage the development of third-party applications on our cloud computing platform.
we are also committed to a sustainable, low-carbon future, advancing equality and diversity, and fostering employee success. we try to integrate social good into everything we do. all of these goals align with our long-term growth strategy and financial and operational priorities.
we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include: our prospective customers' willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; our ability to maintain a balanced portfolio of products and customers; the availability, performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; our ability to continue to meet new and evolving privacy laws and regulations, acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided by third-party cloud computing platform providers; third-party developers' willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers' ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers' purchasing decision or affect attrition rates.
to address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an enterprise license agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party applications on our platforms, realize the benefits from our strategic partnerships and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity, whether internally or through the use of third parties, the hiring of additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer-related areas and research and development, the expansion of domestic and international selling and marketing activities,
specifically in our top markets, the continued development of our brands, the addition of distribution channels, the upgrade of our service offerings, the continued development of services including community cloud and industry clouds, the integration of new and acquired technologies such as commerce cloud, artificial intelligence technologies and salesforce quip, the expansion of our marketing cloud, salesforce platform core service offerings, integration cloud through our may 2018 mulesoft, inc. ("mulesoft") acquisition and the additions to our global infrastructure to support our growth.
we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future and we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in future periods to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. as part of our growth strategy, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, iot and collaborative productivity tools. we drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions, such as our acquisition of mulesoft and in august 2018 our acquisition of datorama, inc. ("datorama"). we have a disciplined and thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of companies. as a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. we remain focused on improving operating margins.
our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible for renewal. we calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. our attrition rate, including the marketing cloud service offering but excluding our commerce cloud service offering and integration service offering, was less than ten percent as of january 31, 2019. while it is difficult to predict, we expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and invest in customer success and related programs.
we expect marketing and sales costs, which were 46 percent, 44 percent and 45 percent of total revenues for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to grow our customer base, sell more products to existing customers, and continue to build greater brand awareness.
during the year, we acquired mulesoft, an industry-leading integration platform, to provide our customers the ability to integrate data across platforms. the financial results of mulesoft are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. the total purchase price for mulesoft was approximately $6.4 billion.
also in fiscal 2019, we acquired datorama, which provides a platform for enterprises, agencies and publishers to integrate data across marketing channels and data sources. the financial results of datorama are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. the total purchase price for datorama was approximately $766 million.
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on january 31. references to fiscal 2019, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending january 31, 2019.
adoption of new accounting standards we have adjusted our consolidated financial statements from amounts previously reported due to the adoption of accounting standards update ("asu") 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers ("topic 606")", which relates to revenue recognition and the capitalization of costs to acquire a revenue contract. the information presented reflects the adjusted amounts as compared to those previously reported. in addition, we have prospectively adopted accounting standards update no. 2016-01, "financial instrument-overall (subtopic 825-10)" ("asu 2016-01") and accounting standards update no. 2016-16, "income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory" ("asu 2016-16"). see note 1, "summary of business and significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, which is incorporated herein by reference.
operating segments we operate as one operating segment. operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by our chief operating decision makers, marc benioff, who is the co-chief executive officer and the chairman of the board, and keith block, who is the co-chief executive officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. over the past few years, we have completed a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of mulesoft and datorama in fiscal 2019. these acquisitions have allowed us to expand our offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. while we have offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of our acquisitions, our business operates in one operating segment because most of our offerings operate on a single customer success platform and are deployed in an identical way, and our chief operating decision makers evaluate our financial information and resources and assess the performance of these resources on a
consolidated basis. since we operate as one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.
in august 2018, we moved to a co-chief executive officer model with the promotion of our vice chairman and chief operating officer, keith block. we determined that both co-chief executive officers also serve as chief operating decision makers for the purposes of segment reporting. despite the change in the chief operating decision maker, we determined no change to segment reporting was necessary as there was no change in the components for which separate financial information is regularly evaluated.
sources of revenues we derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, "cloud services"), software licenses, and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. "other revenue" consists primarily of training fees. subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2019. subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, and the price of our service and renewals. we define a "customer" as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services.
subscription and support revenues for cloud services are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. subscription revenues for software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer. the typical subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. our subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform.
we generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue, or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. in general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period.
professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials, fixed fee or subscription basis. we also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice.
in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in note 1 "summary of business and significant accounting policies" of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, which is incorporated herein by reference.
revenue by cloud service offering the information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. all of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major cloud service offerings. subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions):
salesforce platform and other       2,854                 1,913                 1,433                                           49%                    33%
marketing and commerce cloud        1,898                 1,382                   947                                           37%                    46%
subscription and support revenues from the community cloud, quip and our industry offerings were not significant in fiscal 2019. quip revenue is included with salesforce platform and other in the table above. our industry offerings and community cloud revenue are included in either sales cloud, service cloud or salesforce platform and other depending on the primary service offering purchased. revenue from our acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018 is included in salesforce platform and other.
as required under u.s. gaap, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from mulesoft at fair value on the date of acquisition. as a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that mulesoft would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. of the $2.9 billion subscription and support revenue for salesforce platform and other for fiscal 2019, approximately $360 million was attributed to mulesoft.
in situations where a customer purchases multiple cloud offerings, such as through an enterprise license agreement, we allocate the contract value to each core service offering based on the customer's estimated product demand plan, the service that was provided at the inception of the contract, and standalone selling price ("ssp") of those products. we do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. we have allocated approximately 17 percent, 15 percent, 13 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017, respectively, based on customers' estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above.
additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. for example, customers may use the sales cloud, the service cloud or the salesforce platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings. depending on a customer's actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer's current and future needs. we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer's business requirements and usage. in addition, as we introduce new features and functions within each offering and refine our allocation methodology for changes in our business, we do not expect it to be practical to adjust historical revenue results by service offering for comparability. accordingly, comparisons of revenue performance by core service offering over time may not be meaningful.
our sales cloud service offering is our most widely distributed service offering and has historically been the largest contributor of subscription and support revenues. as a result, sales cloud has the most international exposure and foreign exchange rate exposure relative to the other cloud service offerings. conversely, revenue for marketing and commerce cloud is primarily derived from the americas with little impact from foreign exchange rate movement.
the revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. while we are a market leader in each core offering, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers. accordingly, the revenue result for each cloud service offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter.
seasonal nature of unearned revenue, accounts receivable and operating cash flow unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. we generally invoice our customers in annual cycles. we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. this may result in an increase in unearned revenue and accounts receivable. there is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.
the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below (in millions):
the unearned revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable subscription agreements. transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations ("remaining performance obligation") represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. for multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. low remaining performance obligations attributable to a particular subscription agreement are often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer.
remaining performance obligation, formerly referred to as remaining transaction price, consisted of the following (in billions):
*includes $500 million of remaining performance obligation related to fiscal 2019 acquisitions, including contracts executed subsequent to acquisition.
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies and certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data. we allocate overhead such as it infrastructure, rent, and occupancy charges based on headcount. employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. as such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. the cost of providing professional services is higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors.
we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. for example, we have invested in additional database software and hardware and we plan to increase the capacity that we are able to offer globally through data centers and third-party infrastructure providers. in addition, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in enhancing our cyber security measures. as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with the purchase of acquired developed technology will be included in cost of revenues. additionally, as we enter into new contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. finally, we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services as we believe this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods.
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and security and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant architecture enables us to provide our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. as a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies.
we expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in adding employees and building the necessary system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired businesses, technologies and all of our service offerings.
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities.
we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers, and sponsoring additional marketing events. the timing of these marketing events, such as our annual and largest event, dreamforce, will affect our marketing costs in a particular quarter. in addition, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, a component of the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in marketing and sales. we expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. we expect marketing and sales expenses, excluding sales personnel expenses, to grow in line with or at a slower rate than revenues and sales personnel expenses. these may increase as a percentage of total revenues as we invest in additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, security costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses such as transaction costs for acquisitions and allocated overhead. we expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to either remain flat or decrease for the next several quarters. however, the timing of additional expenses in a particular quarter, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, will affect our general and administrative expenses.
stock-based expenses our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock-based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors. we recognize our stock-based compensation as an expense in the statements of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we acquire more companies, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees.
amortization of purchased intangible assets acquired through business combinations our cost of revenues, operating expenses and other expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company's developed technology, trade names and trademarks, and customer relationships. we expect this expense to fluctuate as we acquire more businesses and intangible assets become fully amortized.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 "summary of business and significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.
revenue recognition - contracts with multiple performance obligations. we enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple cloud services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.
cloud services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. in determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services work. to date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct.
we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ("ssp") basis. the ssp is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we determine ssp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. as our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to ssp.
in certain cases, we are able to establish ssp based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. we use a single amount to estimate ssp when it has observable prices. if ssp is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of ssp. we determine the ssp range using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.
costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts. costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit. therefore, we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors which include the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition.
business combinations. accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:
•   future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;
•   the acquired company's trade name and existing customer relationships, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;
•   uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
income taxes. valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gain, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.
our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.
strategic investments. accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. privately held
equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer and impairments.
privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. the carrying value is adjusted for our privately held equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee.
we assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including the investee's financial metrics, the investee's products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, the investee's liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. if the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.

*prior period information has been adjusted for the adoption of topic 606.
the following table sets forth selected balance sheet and other metrics data for each of the periods indicated (in millions, other than remaining performance obligation, which is presented in billions):
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities       $4,342                $4,521
remaining performance obligation                         25.7                  20.6
remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
(in millions)                                   2019                        2018             dollars         percent subscription and support              $12,413                      $9,766                $2,647             27     %
the increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. our acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018 contributed $431 million to total revenues in fiscal 2019. the increase was also driven by approximately $227 million of revenue recognized at a point in time, which includes the portion of software subscriptions allocated to the on-premise software element.
we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.
revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. americas revenue attributed to the united states was approximately 96 percent during fiscal year 2019 and 2018.
revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for $3.8 billion, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2019, compared to $2.9 billion, or 28 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $0.9 billion, or 31 percent. the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international resources. revenues outside of the americas increased on a total dollar basis by $39 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 due to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of the strengthening british pound sterling.
subscription and support               $2,604                      $2,033                       $571
the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $156 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $31 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $326 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $49 million and an increase of $26 million in allocated overhead. we have increased our headcount by 16 percent since january 31, 2018 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, of which a component was also due to the acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018. we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. we also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in future periods.
the cost of professional services and other revenues was $847 million during fiscal 2019 resulting in positive gross margin of $22 million. the cost of professional services and other revenues was $740 million during fiscal 2018 resulting in positive gross margins of $34 million. we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal quarters. we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.
research and development          $1,886                      $1,553                       $333
marketing and sales                6,064                       4,671                      1,393
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately $216 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $47 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead. we increased our research and development headcount by 19 percent since january 31, 2018 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies, and integrate acquired companies, including our acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018. additionally, a component of our increased headcount was also due to the acquisition of mulesoft. we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies.
the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $797 million in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $174 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $111 million, and allocated overhead. our marketing and sales headcount increased by 25 percent since january 31, 2018, of which a component was due to the acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018. the increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. we expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel.
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs. our general and administrative headcount increased by 27 percent since january 31, 2018 as we added personnel to support our growth as well as an increase due to the acquisition of mulesoft in may 2018.
investment income                             $57                         $36                        $21

the increase in investment income was due to higher interest income across our portfolio, which is primarily a result of increasing interest rates.
interest expense consists of interest on our debt, capital leases, and financing obligation related to 350 mission. the increase in interest expense was primarily driven by interest expense on the 2023 senior notes and 2028 senior notes of approximately $71 million. we expect interest expense to increase in future years as the 2023 senior notes and 2028 senior notes will be outstanding for a full year as compared to a partial year in fiscal 2019.
gains on strategic investments, net consists primarily of mark-to-market adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities, observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments. the prospective adoption of asu 2016-01 resulted in unrealized gains in our equity securities of approximately $446 million during fiscal 2019, excluding gains on sales of equity securities. these gains were primarily driven by mark-to-market adjustments to our publicly traded securities of $345 million during fiscal 2019.
other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions.
benefit from (provision for) income taxes.
benefit from (provision for) income taxes          $127                        $(60   )      $187
we recorded a tax benefit of $127 million on a pretax income of $983 million for fiscal 2019. the tax benefit recorded was primarily related to the release of our valuation allowance related to federal and state deferred tax assets, which was partially offset with the increase in unrecognized tax benefits. in addition, we recorded current tax expense for profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states.
in fiscal 2018, we recorded a tax provision of $60 million on a pretax income of $420 million. the tax provision recorded was primarily related to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states.

the increase in subscription and support revenues during fiscal 2018 was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which included new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers. additionally, fiscal 2018 benefited from a full year of revenue from demandware, which we acquired in july 2016. this was offset by a reduction in subscription revenues of approximately $20 million as a result of one less day in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. changes in the net price per user per month have not been a significant driver of revenue growth for the periods presented. the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.

the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $192 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $23 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $197 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of amortization of purchased intangible assets of $38 million and an increase of $23 million in allocated overhead. we increased our headcount by 11 percent during fiscal 2018 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers and as a result of our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.
the cost of professional services and other revenues was $740 million during fiscal 2018 resulting in positive gross margin of $34 million. the cost of professional services and other revenues was $617 million during fiscal 2017 resulting in positive gross margins of $21 million.

the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately $212 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $72 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead. we increased our research and development headcount by 11 percent during fiscal 2018 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate previously acquired companies, including our fiscal 2017 acquisitions.
the change in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $637 million in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $80 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $23 million and allocated overhead. our marketing and sales headcount increased by 22 percent
during fiscal 2018. the increase in headcount was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.

the increase in investment income was due to higher interest income across our portfolio.
interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes, capital leases, financing obligation related to 350 mission, the loan assumed on 50 fremont, revolving credit facility and the $500 million term loan that was entered into in connection with our acquisition of demandware.
gains on strategic investments, net represents strategic investments' fair market value adjustments and gains recognized related to strategic investments when we acquire an entity in which we previously held a strategic investment. the difference between the fair value of the shares as of the date of the acquisition and the carrying value of the strategic investment is recorded as a gain or loss. the change in gains on strategic investments, net was primarily due to $14 million of gains resulting from our acquisition of companies in which we held strategic investments in fiscal 2017.
other income (expense) primarily consists of non-operating transactions such as gains and losses from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and real estate transactions.
benefit from (provision for) income taxes.
benefit from (provision for) income taxes   $(60          )                    $144          $(204           )
we recognized a tax provision of $60 million on a pretax income of $420 million for fiscal 2018. the tax provision recorded was primarily related to income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states.
in fiscal 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $144 million on a pretax income of $179 million for fiscal 2017. the most significant component of this tax amount was the discrete tax benefit of $210 million from a partial release of the valuation allowance in connection with the acquisition of demandware. the net deferred tax liability from the acquisition of demandware provided a source of additional income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax assets and, as a result, we released a portion of our valuation allowance. the tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance was partially offset by income taxes in profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states.
liquidity and capital resources at january 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $4.3 billion and accounts receivable of $4.9 billion. our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, u.s. treasury securities, asset backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage backed obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities.
as of january 31, 2019, our remaining performance obligation was $25.7 billion. our remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue, which has been invoiced and is recorded on the balance sheet, and unbilled amounts that are not recorded on the balance sheet, that will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our credit facility and unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months.
in the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments.
cash flows for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, our cash flows were as follows (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities      $3,398                $2,738                $2,162
net cash used in investing activities          (5,308    )           (2,011    )           (2,684    )
net cash provided by financing activities       2,010                   221                   998
cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by the amount of net income adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization; amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations; the expense associated with stock-based awards; net gains on strategic investments; the timing of employee related costs including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities; the timing of our semi-annual interest payments related to our senior notes; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating cash flows; the timing of business combination activity and the related integration and transaction costs; and changes in working capital accounts. net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by payments made during fiscal 2019 for the transaction fees related to the acquisition of mulesoft.
our working capital accounts consist of accounts receivable, costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, prepaid assets and other current assets. claims against working capital include accounts payable, accrued expenses, unearned revenue, and other current liabilities and payments related to our debt obligations. our working capital may be impacted by factors in future periods such as billings to customers for subscriptions and support services, and the subsequent collection of those billings, certain amounts and timing of which are seasonal. our working capital in some quarters may be impacted by adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements and this impact may increase as our working capital balances increase in our foreign subsidiaries. our billings are also influenced by new business linearity within the quarters and across the quarters.
as described above in "seasonal nature of unearned revenue, accounts receivable and operating cash flow," our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals and, correspondingly, the first quarter has historically been the strongest for cash collections. the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall business causes both the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter and cash collections in the first quarter to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings.
we generally invoice our customers for our subscription and services contracts in advance in annual installments. we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. such invoice amounts are initially reflected in accounts receivable and unearned revenue, which is reflected on the balance sheets, and as the next billing cycle approaches, the corresponding unearned revenue decreases to zero. the operating cash flow benefit of increased billing activity generally occurs in the subsequent quarter when we collect from our customers. as such, our first quarter is our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter.
the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2019 primarily related to the acquisitions of mulesoft, datorama and cloudcraze, net of cash acquired for a total of $5.1 billion. net cash used in investing activities also included purchases of marketable securities of $1.1 billion, purchases of strategic investments of $362 million and new office build outs and capital investments of $595 million, offset by sales of marketable securities of $1.4 billion. the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2018 primarily related to purchases of marketable securities of $2.0 billion, new office build-outs and capital investments of $534 million, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $636 million. the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2017 primarily related to business combinations with the largest being the acquisition of demandware in july 2016 and purchases of marketable securities, which were offset by the cash inflows for the period from sales and maturities of marketable securities.
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of $3.0 billion from proceeds from issuance of debt which were used in the acquisition of mulesoft, and $704 million from proceeds from equity plans, offset by $1.5 billion of repayments of debt including principal payments on the maturity of the 0.25% senior notes and the early repayment and termination of the 2019 term loan. net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of $650 million from proceeds from equity plans offset by $323 million in repayments of debt. net cash provided by
financing activities during fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt, which were used to partially fund acquisitions, offset by repayments of debt.

as of january 31, 2019, we have senior unsecured debt outstanding due in 2021, 2023 and 2028 with a total carrying value of $3.0 billion. in addition, we have senior secured notes outstanding related to our loan on 50 fremont due in 2023 with a total carrying value of $196 million. we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of january 31, 2019.
we maintain a revolving loan credit agreement that provides for $1.0 billion unsecured financing ("credit facility") that matures in april 2023. we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the credit facility for refinancing other indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of january 31, 2019.
as of january 31, 2019, we have a total of $92 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. to date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through december 2030.
we do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

the majority of our operating lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations.
the financing obligation - leased facility above represents the total obligation for our lease of approximately 445,000 rentable square feet of office space at 350 mission st. ("350 mission") in san francisco, california. as of january 31, 2019, $215 million of the total obligation noted above was recorded to financing obligation - leased facility, of which the current portion is included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" and the noncurrent portion is included in "other noncurrent liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets.
the lease obligation - buildings to be constructed above represents the total obligation for two separate agreements for office facilities we entered into during fiscal 2019. the first agreement is for approximately 324,000 rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed as part of our urban campus in san francisco, california. we expect to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2024 and the total non-cancelable minimum payments under this agreement are approximately $480 million over 16 years. construction has not commenced on the building and is dependent on the developer obtaining approvals from the city and county of san francisco. the second agreement is for approximately 603,000 rentable square feet of office space in a building to be constructed in chicago, illinois. we expect to begin occupying the space in fiscal 2022 and the total non-cancelable minimum payments under this agreement are approximately $475 million over 17 years. as of january 31, 2019 construction has not commenced on either of these buildings and the timing of completion of construction is unknown. due to this uncertainty, the entire commitment for these two obligations is reflected as payments due in more than five years in the table above.
we have entered into various contractual commitments with infrastructure service providers for a total commitment of $2.0 billion, which are reflected in the table above under "contractual commitments." as of january 31, 2019, the total remaining commitment is approximately $1.8 billion and $264 million is due in the next fiscal year.
purchase orders are not included in the table above. our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.
during fiscal 2019 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations, increase productivity and enhance our security measures. we plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. additionally, we expect capital expenditures to be higher in absolute dollars and remain consistent as a percentage of total revenues in future periods as a result of continued office build-outs, other leasehold improvements and data center investments.
utilization of tax carryforwards and credits as we continue our trend in profitability, we expect to utilize our net operating loss carryforward and various tax credits to reduce our cash tax payments. for example, our federal net operating loss carryforwards are $2.1 billion as of january 31,
2019 as compared to $2.7 billion as of january 31, 2018. we expect our cash tax payments for the next 12 months, primarily from profitable jurisdictions outside of the u.s, to be consistent with those paid in prior years.

environmental, social and governance we believe the business of business is improving the state of the world for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, partners, employees, community, environment and society. we are committed to creating a sustainable, low-carbon future by delivering a carbon neutral cloud, operating as a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions company and by working to achieve our goal of 100 percent renewable energy for our global operations by fiscal 2022. we also believe consistent, comparable and reliable disclosures around climate-related risks and opportunities are important. to this end, we are working to align with the recommendations of the financial stability board's ("fsb") task force on climate-related financial disclosures ("tcfd") and of the sustainability accounting standards board ("sasb"). in addition, we have spearheaded human capital management initiatives to drive equality in four key areas: equal rights, equal pay, equal education and equal opportunity. we also pioneered and have inspired other companies to adopt our 1-1-1 integrated philanthropy model, which leverages one percent of a company's equity, employee time and product to help improve communities around the world. we publish an annual stakeholder impact report on our website detailing our overall strategy relating to environmental, social and governance ("esg") programs as well as our efforts in these areas.
below are some of the key highlights of our ongoing esg efforts:
•   in fiscal 2019, we remained a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions company, continued delivering a carbon neutral cloud for all customers and procured electricity from renewable energy resources equivalent to 55 percent of what we used globally. to support our commitment to renewable energy, we have signed four virtual power purchase agreements ("vppas"). this includes two agreements which were signed in fiscal 2019: our largest vppa to date with a new wind energy project in illinois that is expected to be operational in fiscal year 2020, and our first-ever renewable energy aggregation deal with a new solar energy project in north carolina which is expected to be operational in fiscal 2021. in addition, the three buildings at our corporate headquarters in san francisco sourced 100 percent renewable energy in fiscal 2019.
•   we are active in and support organizations that move the united states and the world toward a more sustainable, low-carbon future. in fiscal 2019, we partnered with mission 2020 to establish the step up declaration, a new alliance committed to harnessing the power of emerging technologies to help reduce emissions across all economic sectors. as part of the declaration we committed to expand our carbon offset program to include business travel and employee commuting, and to continue to expand our sustainable real estate commitments. we also committed to setting our own science-based targets, including working with our suppliers to set their own climate targets. in addition, we were a founding member of the business renewables center, signed the corporate renewable energy buyers' principles, helped to launch the corporate colocation and cloud buyers' principles, disclosed our annual carbon emissions to the carbon disclosure project and signed on to initiatives such as we mean business and the american business act on climate.
•   as part of our ongoing work to promote equality, we review the salaries and bonuses of our global workforce on an annual basis to ensure everyone is paid equally for equal work and close any unexplained gaps. to date, we have spent $8.7 million to ensure equal pay for equal work. we also review differences in pay for not only gender, but also race and ethnicity in the united states.
•   our employees are engaged in and actively support our commitment to equality and enhancing our ohana culture. we support ten employee-led and founded "ohana groups," which provide a community for underrepresented groups and their allies, offer professional development and mentoring opportunities, and empower employees to be responsive equality leaders in their community. this has resulted in nearly half of our employees engaging in ohana groups in fiscal 2019.
•   together with the salesforce foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and salesforce.org, a nonprofit social enterprise, which are not included in our consolidated financial statements, to date we have given approximately $260 million to charitable organizations, logged more than 3.8 million employee volunteer hours around the world and provided more than 40,000 nonprofit and higher education organizations with the use of our service offerings for free or at a discount.
•   we have significantly increased the diversity of our board over the past five years, including with respect to gender and race.

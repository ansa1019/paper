item 1a. risk factors the risks listed below present risks that could have a material impact on the bancorps financial condition, the results of its operations or its business. some of these risks are interrelated and the occurrence of one or more of them may exacerbate the effect of others.
credit risks deteriorating credit quality has adversely impacted fifth third in the past and may adversely impact fifth third in the future.
when fifth third lends money or commits to lend money the bancorp incurs credit risk or the risk of loss if borrowers do not repay their loans, leases, credit cards, derivative obligations, or other credit obligations. the performance of these credit portfolios significantly affects the bancorps financial results and condition. if the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more customers may have difficulty in repaying their credit obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and reserves for credit losses. fifth third reserves for credit losses by establishing reserves through a charge to earnings. the amount of these reserves is based on fifth thirds assessment of credit losses inherent in the credit portfolios including unfunded credit commitments. the process for determining the amount of the alll and the reserve for unfunded commitments is critical to fifth thirds financial results and condition. it requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the environment, including analysis of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans.
fifth third might underestimate the credit losses inherent in its portfolios and have credit losses in excess of the amount reserved. fifth third might increase the reserve because of changing economic conditions, including falling home prices or higher unemployment, or other factors such as changes in borrowers behavior or changing protections in credit agreements. as an example, borrowers may strategically default, or discontinue making payments on their real estate-secured loans if the value of the real estate is less than what they owe, even if they are still financially able to make the payments.
fifth third believes that both the alll and the reserve for unfunded commitments are adequate to cover inherent losses at december 31, 2018; however, there is no assurance that they will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if housing and employment conditions decline. in the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, fifth third may be required to increase reserves in future periods, which would reduce earnings.
for more information, refer to the credit risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a and the allowance for loan and losses and reserve for unfunded commitments subsections of the critical accounting policies section of md&a.
fifth third may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent loans are concentrated by location or industry of the borrowers or collateral.
fifth thirds credit risk and credit losses can increase if its loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. deterioration in economic conditions, housing conditions and commodity and real estate values in certain states or locations could result in materially higher credit losses if loans are concentrated in those locations. fifth third has significant exposures to businesses in certain economic sectors such as manufacturing, real estate, financial services, insurance and healthcare, and weaknesses in those businesses may adversely impact fifth thirds business, results of operations or financial condition. additionally fifth third has a substantial portfolio of commercial and residential real estate loans and weaknesses in residential or commercial real estate markets may adversely impact fifth thirds business, results of operations or financial condition.
problems encountered by financial institutions larger than or similar to fifth third could adversely affect financial markets generally and have direct and indirect adverse effects on fifth third.
fifth third has exposure to counterparties in the financial services industry and other industries, and routinely executes transactions with such counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. many of fifth thirds transactions with other financial institutions expose fifth third to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. in addition, fifth thirds credit risk may be affected when the collateral it holds cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. as a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which the bancorp interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect fifth third.
liquidity risks fifth third must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.
fifth third must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. fifth third primarily relies on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans fifth third makes and the operations of fifth thirds business. core deposits, which include transaction deposits and other time deposits, have historically provided fifth third with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds (average core deposits funded 72% of average total assets for the year ending december 31, 2018). in addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include investments in the securities portfolio, fifth thirds sale or securitization of loans in secondary markets and the pledging of loans and investment securities to access secured borrowing facilities through the fhlb and the frb, and fifth thirds ability to raise funds in domestic and international money and capital markets.
fifth thirds liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general similar to what occurred during the financial crisis in 2008 and early 2009, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms.
26  fifth third bancorp other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect fifth thirds liquidity and funding include:
●                    a lack of market or customer confidence in fifth third or negative news about fifth third or the financial services industry generally, which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets;
●   the loss of customer deposits due to competition from other banks or due to alternative investments;
●   inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets,
●   increased regulatory requirements,
●   and reductions in one or more of fifth thirds credit ratings.
a reduced credit rating could adversely affect fifth thirds ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect fifth thirds ability to raise liquidity or capital. many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which fifth third has little or no control such as what occurred during the financial crisis. there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur again in the future.
recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact fifth thirds results of operations and competitive position. various regulations have been adopted to impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including fifth third. these regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing and minimum liquidity requirements. given the overlap and complex interactions of these new and prospective liquidity-related regulations with other regulatory changes, including the capital and resolution and recovery framework applicable to fifth third, the full impact of these regulations will remain uncertain until their full implementation. although the application of certain of these regulations to banking organizations such as fifth third are expected to be modified, including in connection with the implementation of the egrrcpa, there remains uncertainty as to the timing, scope and nature of any changes to regulatory requirements. uncertainty about the timing and scope of changes as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime may negatively impact fifth thirds business.
if fifth third is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if fifth third suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, then fifth thirds liquidity, operating margins and financial results and condition may be materially adversely affected. fifth third may also need to raise additional capital and liquidity through the issuance of stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate common stock dividends or share repurchases to preserve capital and liquidity.
fifth third and/or the holders of its securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable ratings from rating agencies.
fifth thirds ability to access the capital markets is important to its overall funding profile. this access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to fifth third, certain of its subsidiaries and particular classes of securities they issue. the interest rates that fifth third pays on its securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that it, its subsidiaries and/or its securities receive from recognized rating agencies. a downgrade to fifth third or its subsidiaries credit rating could affect its ability to access the capital markets, increase its borrowing costs and negatively impact its profitability. a ratings downgrade to fifth third, its subsidiaries or their securities could also create obligations or liabilities of fifth third under the terms of its outstanding securities that could increase fifth thirds costs or otherwise have a negative effect on its results of operations or financial condition. additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by fifth third or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.
if fifth third is unable to maintain or grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.
the total amount that fifth third pays for funding costs is dependent, in part, on fifth thirds ability to maintain or grow its deposits. if fifth third is unable to sufficiently maintain or grow its deposits to meet liquidity objectives, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs. fifth third competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. if competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, fifth thirds funding costs may increase, either because fifth third raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because fifth third loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. also, customers typically move money from bank deposits to alternative investments during rising interest rate environments, an environment that the u.s. has seen recently and is expected to see over the medium-term. customers may also move noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing accounts increasing the cost of those deposits. checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. fifth thirds bank customers could take their money out of fifth third bank and put it in alternative investments, causing fifth third to lose a lower cost source of funding. higher funding costs reduce fifth thirds net interest margin and net interest income.
the bancorps ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries accounts for most of its revenue and could affect its liquidity and ability to pay dividends.
fifth third bancorp is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. fifth third bancorp typically receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on fifth third bancorps stock and interest and principal on its debt. various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that the bancorps banking subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. regulatory scrutiny of liquidity and capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks such as the parent bank holding companies. also, fifth third bancorps right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors.
27  fifth third bancorp limitations on the bancorps ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on stock or interest and principal on its debt and to engage in share repurchases. for further information refer to note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
operational risks fifth third is exposed to cyber-security risks, including denial of service, hacking and identity theft, which could result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information.
fifth third relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. this includes the use of networks, the internet, digital applications and the telecommunications and computer systems of third parties to perform business activities. additionally, digital and mobile technologies are leveraged to interact with customers, which increases the risk of information security breaches. any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to fifth thirds accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect its customer relationships. while fifth third has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently remediated.
there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber-attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. there have been several recent instances involving financial services, credit bureaus and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, by both private individuals and foreign governments. in addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, fifth third may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. furthermore, there has been a well-publicized series of apparently related distributed denial of service attacks on large financial services companies, including fifth third bank, and ransom attacks where hackers have requested payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information.
cyber threats are rapidly evolving and fifth third may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks. these risks are heightened through the increasing use of digital and mobile solutions which allow for rapid money movement and increase the difficulty to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. fifth third may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks or in the investigation of such cyber-attacks or related to the protection of the bancorps customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. fifth third may also be required to incur significant costs in connection with any regulatory investigation or civil litigation resulting from a cyber-attack. despite its efforts, the occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of fifth thirds systems or third-party service providers (or providers to such third-party service providers), particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could also seriously damage fifth thirds reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in substantial remediation costs, additional cyber-security protection costs and increased insurance premiums, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability.
fifth third relies on its systems and certain third-party service providers and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations.
fifth thirds operations, including its financial and accounting systems, use computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both fifth third and third-party service providers. additionally, fifth third collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing those and other systems and networks. fifth third has security, backup and recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan to ensure the systems will not be inoperable. fifth third also has security to prevent unauthorized access to the systems. in addition, fifth third requires its third-party service providers to maintain similar controls. however, fifth third cannot be certain that the measures will be successful.
a security breach in these systems or the loss or corruption of confidential information such as business results, transaction records and related information could adversely impact fifth thirds ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities, significant reputational harm and the loss of confidence in fifth third. additionally, security breaches or the loss, theft or corruption of confidential customer information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, account balances or other information could result in losses by our customers, litigation, regulatory sanctions, lost customers and revenue, increased costs and significant reputational harm.
fifth thirds necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume poses the risk that technical system flaws or employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. fifth third may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages).
third parties with which the bancorp does business both domestically and offshore, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the bancorps customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the bancorp, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the bancorps security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. security breaches affecting the bancorps customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the bancorp to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the bancorp or its customers, thereby increasing the bancorps operational costs and potentially diminishing customer satisfaction. if personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the bancorps possession were to be mishandled or misused, the bancorp could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the bancorps systems, employees or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties.
28  fifth third bancorp the bancorp may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the bancorps control, which may include, for example, security breaches; electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer components or servers or other damage to the bancorps property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies; or events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. for example, it has been reported that there is a fundamental security flaw in computer chips found in many types of computing devices, including phones, tablets, laptops and desktops. while the bancorp believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the bancorp or its customers and clients.
any failures or disruptions of the bancorps systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the bancorps business and results of operations by subjecting the bancorp to losses or liability, or require the bancorp to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the bancorp to reputational harm, litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance. the bancorp could also be adversely affected if it loses access to information or services from a third-party service provider as a result of a security breach or system or operational failure or disruption affecting the third-party service provider.
fifth third may not be able to effectively manage organizational changes and implement key initiatives in a timely fashion, or at all, due to competing priorities which could adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.
fifth third is subject to rapid changes in technology, regulation and product innovation, and faces intense competition for customers, sources of revenue, capital, services, qualified employees and other essential business resources. in order to meet these challenges, fifth third is or may be engaged in numerous critical strategic initiatives at the same time. accomplishing these initiatives may be complex, time intensive and require significant financial, technological, management and other resources. these initiatives may consume managements attention and may compete for limited resources. in addition, organizational changes may need to be implemented throughout fifth third as a result of the new products, services, partnerships and processes that arise from the execution of the various strategic initiatives. fifth third may have difficulty managing these organizational changes and executing these initiatives effectively in a timely fashion, or at all. fifth thirds failure to do so could expose it to litigation or regulatory action and may damage fifth thirds business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.
fifth third may not be able to successfully implement future information technology system enhancements, which could adversely affect fifth thirds business operations and profitability.
fifth third invests significant resources in information technology system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. fifth third may not be able to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements, or may not be able to do so on a cost-effective basis. such sanctions could include fines and result in reputational harm and have other negative effects. in addition, future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations. failure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact fifth thirds financial condition and results of operations and could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components. in addition, fifth third may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time.
fifth thirds framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating its risk and loss.
fifth thirds risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. fifth third has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, legal risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, reputational risk and operational risk related to its employees, systems and vendors, among others. any system of control and any system to reduce risk exposure, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. a failure in fifth thirds internal controls could have a significant negative impact not only on its earnings, but also on the perception that customers, regulators and investors may have of fifth third. fifth third continues to devote a significant amount of effort, time and resources to improving its controls and ensuring compliance with complex regulations.
additionally, instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance, credit, liquidity, operational and business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. as a result, fifth third may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk. if fifth thirds risk management framework proves ineffective, fifth third could incur litigation, negative regulatory consequences, reputational damages among other adverse consequences and fifth third could suffer unexpected losses that may affect its financial condition or results of operations.
fifth third may experience losses incurred due to customer or employee fraud, theft or physical violence. additionally, physical violence may negatively affect fifth thirds key personnel, facilities or systems. these losses may be material and negatively affect fifth thirds results of operations, financial condition or prospects. these losses could also lead to significant reputational risks and other effects. the sophistication of external fraud actors continues to increase, and in some cases includes large criminal rings, which increases the resources and infrastructure needed to thwart these attacks. the industry fraud threat continues to evolve, including but not limited to card fraud, check fraud, social engineering and phishing attacks for identity theft and account takeover. fifth third continues to invest in fraud prevention in the forms of people and systems designed to prevent, detect and mitigate the customer and financial impacts.
fifth third could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.
fifth thirds success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that fifth third serves is intense, which may increase fifth thirds expenses and may result in fifth third not being able to hire candidates or retain them.
29  fifth third bancorp if fifth third is not able to hire qualified candidates or retain its key personnel, fifth third may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations and financial condition.
compensation paid by financial institutions such as fifth third is heavily regulated, particularly under dodd-frank, which regulation affects the amount and form of compensation fifth third pays to hire and retain talented employees. if fifth third is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more expensive, fifth thirds performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.
regulatory compliance risks fifth third is subject to extensive governmental regulation which could adversely impact fifth third or the businesses in which fifth third is engaged.
government regulation and legislation subject fifth third and other financial institutions to restrictions, oversight and/or costs that may have an impact on fifth thirds business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of its common stock.
fifth third is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations and limit the businesses in which fifth third may engage. these laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers and depositors and are not designed to protect security-holders. the impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact fifth third or its ability to increase the value of its business. additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against fifth third could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defending itself and may lead to penalties that materially affect fifth third and its shareholders. future changes in the laws, including tax laws, or regulations or their interpretations or enforcement may also be materially adverse to fifth third and its shareholders or may require fifth third to expend significant time and resources to comply with such requirements.
fifth third cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on fifth third. changes in regulation could affect fifth third in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, legislation or regulatory reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that fifth third deals with in the course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. the extent to which fifth third can adjust its strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not known at this time.
in addition, changes in laws or regulations that affect fifth thirds customers and business partners could negatively affect fifth thirds revenues and expenses. certain changes in laws such as recent tax law reforms that impose limitations on the deductibility of interest may decrease the demand for fifth thirds products or services and could negatively affect its revenues and results of operations. other changes in laws or regulations could cause fifth thirds third-party service providers and other vendors to increase the prices they charge to fifth third and negatively affect fifth thirds expenses and financial results.
fifth third is subject to various regulatory requirements that may limit its operations and potential growth.
under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions and their holding companies, the frb, the fdic, the cfpb and the division have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions by the bancorp and fifth third bank. the bancorp and fifth third bank are subject to such supervisory authority and, more generally, must, in certain instances, obtain prior regulatory approval before engaging in certain activities or corporate decisions. there can be no assurance that such approvals, if required, would be forthcoming or that such approvals would be granted in a timely manner. failure to receive any such approval, if required, could limit or impair the bancorps operations, restrict its growth, ability to compete, innovate or participate in industry consolidation and/or affect its dividend policy. such actions and activities subject to prior approval include, but are not limited to, increasing dividends or capital distributions by the bancorp or fifth third bank, entering into a merger or acquisition transaction, acquiring or establishing new branches, and entering into certain new businesses.
failure by the bancorp or fifth third bank to meet the applicable eligibility requirements for fhc status (including capital and management requirements and that fifth third bank maintain at least a satisfactory cra rating) may result in restrictions on certain activities of the bancorp, including the commencement of new activities and mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions and could ultimately result in the loss of financial holding company status.
fifth third and other financial institutions are subject to scrutiny from government authorities, including bank regulatory authorities, stemming from broader systemic regulatory concerns, including with respect to stress testing, liquidity and capital levels, asset quality, provisioning, aml/bsa, consumer compliance and other prudential matters and efforts to ensure that financial institutions take steps to improve their risk management and prevent future crises.
in this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement, are also pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect fifth thirds ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. the government enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines, or restitution; to issue cease and desist or removal orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
in some cases, regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed, which restrict or limit a financial institution. finally, as part of fifth thirds regular examination process, the bancorp and fifth third banks respective regulators may advise it and its banking subsidiary to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. such supervisory actions or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could negatively affect fifth thirds ability to engage in new activities and certain transactions, as well as have a material adverse effect on fifth thirds business and results of operations and may not be publicly disclosed.
30  fifth third bancorp fifth third could face serious negative consequences if its third-party service providers, business partners or investments fail to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations.
fifth third is expected to oversee the legal and regulatory compliance of its business endeavors, including those performed by third-party service providers, business partners, other vendors and certain companies in which fifth third has invested. legal authorities and regulators could hold fifth third responsible for failures by these parties to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations. these failures could expose fifth third to significant litigation or regulatory action that could limit its activities or impose significant fines or other financial losses. additionally, fifth third could be subject to significant litigation from consumers or other parties harmed by these failures and could suffer significant losses of business and revenue, as well as reputational harm as a result of these failures.
as a regulated entity, the bancorp is subject to certain capital requirements that may limit its operations and potential growth.
as a bhc and an fhc, the bancorp is subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the frb, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements, investment practices, dividend policy and growth. the bancorp must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by the frb which can change depending upon general economic conditions and the bancorps particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. compliance with the capital requirements, including leverage ratios, may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect the bancorps ability to expand or maintain present business levels.
u.s. federal banking agencies capital rules implementing basel iii became effective for the bancorp on january 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain components and other provisions. the need to maintain more and higher quality capital as well as greater liquidity could limit fifth thirds business activities, including lending and the ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions as well as the ability to make capital distributions. moreover, although the capital requirements are being phased in over time, u.s. federal banking agencies take into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet the capital requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases and share repurchases.
failure by fifth third bank to meet applicable capital requirements could subject it to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. these include limitations on the ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase shares, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic.
the bancorps ability to pay or increase dividends on its common stock or to repurchase its capital stock is restricted.
the bancorps ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock is subject to regulatory requirements and the need to meet regulatory expectations. as part of ccar, the bancorps capital plan is subject to an annual assessment by the frb, and the frb may object to the bancorps capital plan if the bancorp does not demonstrate an ability to maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon. if the frb objects to the bancorps capital plan, it would be subject to limitations on its ability to make capital distributions (including paying dividends and repurchasing stock).
regulation of fifth third by the cftc imposes additional operational and compliance costs.
the cftc and sec regulate the u.s. derivatives markets pursuant to the authority provided under title vii of dodd-frank. while most of the provisions related to derivatives markets are now in effect, several additional requirements await final regulations from the relevant regulatory agencies for derivatives, the cftc and the sec. one aspect of this regulatory regime for derivatives is that substantial oversight responsibility has been provided to the cftc, which, as a result, now has a meaningful supervisory role with respect to some of fifth thirds businesses. in 2014, fifth third bank provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became subject to new substantive requirements, including real time trade reporting and robust record keeping requirements, business conduct requirements (including daily valuations, disclosure of material risks associated with swaps and disclosure of material incentives and conflicts of interest) and mandatory clearing and exchange trading of all standardized swaps designated by the relevant regulatory agencies as required to be cleared. although the ultimate impact will depend on the promulgation of all final regulations, fifth thirds derivatives activity is subject to frb margin requirements and may also be subject to capital requirements specific to this derivatives activity. these requirements will collectively impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on fifth third and will introduce additional legal risk (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action). once finalized, the rules may raise the costs and liquidity burden associated with fifth thirds derivatives activities and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
deposit insurance premiums levied against fifth third bank may increase if the number of bank failures increase or the cost of resolving failed banks increases.
the fdic maintains a dif to protect insured depositors in the event of bank failures. the dif is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions including fifth third bank. future deposit premiums paid by fifth third bank depend on fdic rules, which are subject to change, the level of the dif and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures. fifth third bank may be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums if market developments change such that the dif balance is reduced or the fdic changes its rules to require higher premiums.
if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bhc or non-bank financial company were triggered, fifth third could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund.
dodd-frank created authority for the orderly liquidation of systemically important bhcs and non-bank financial companies and is based on the fdics bank resolution model. the secretary of the u.s. treasury may trigger liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the president of the united states and after receiving a recommendation from the board of the fdic and the frb upon a two-thirds vote. liquidation proceedings will be funded by the orderly liquidation fund established under dodd-frank, which will borrow from the u.s. treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies.
31  fifth third bancorp risk-based assessments would be made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as fifth third. any such assessments may adversely affect fifth thirds business, financial condition or results of operations.
market risks the replacement of libor could adversely affect fifth thirds revenue or expenses and the value of those assets or obligations.
libor and certain other benchmarks are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. on july 27, 2017, the united kingdoms financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021. the announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021. while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor, a group of large banks, the alternative reference rate committee or arrc, selected and the federal reserve bank of new york started in may 2018 to publish the secured overnight finance rate or sofr as an alternative to libor. sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by treasury securities, given the depth and robustness of the u.s. treasury repurchase market. furthermore, the bank of england has commenced publication of a reformed sterling overnight index average or sonia, comprised of a broader set of overnight sterling money market transactions, as of april 23, 2018. the sonia has been recommended as the alternative to sterling libor by the working group on sterling risk-free reference rates. at this time, it is impossible to predict whether sofr and sonia will become accepted alternatives to libor.
the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate, including sofr or sonia, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on fifth thirds business, financial condition and results of operations. in particular, any such transition could:
●                                                                 adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with, the bancorps floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally;
●                               adversely affect the value of the bancorps floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally;
●   prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the bancorps preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate;
●   result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and
enforceability of certain fallback language in libor-based securities; and
●                            require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition the bancorps risk management processes from libor-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark, such as sofr or reformed sonia.
the manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on fifth thirds funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.
weakness in the u.s. economy, including within fifth thirds geographic footprint, has adversely affected fifth third in the past and may adversely affect fifth third in the future.
if the strength of the u.s. economy in general or the strength of the local economies in which fifth third conducts operations declines, this could result in, among other things, a decreased demand for fifth thirds products and services, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit, including a resultant effect on fifth thirds loan portfolio and alll and in the receipt of lower proceeds from the sale of loans and foreclosed properties. these factors could result in higher delinquencies, greater charge-offs and increased losses in future periods, which could materially adversely affect fifth thirds financial condition and results of operations.
global political and economic uncertainties and changes may adversely affect fifth third.
global financial markets, including the united states, face political and economic uncertainties that may delay investment and hamper economic activity. international events such as trade disputes, separatist movements, leadership changes and political and military conflicts could adversely affect global financial activity and markets and could negatively affect the u.s. economy. additionally, the frb and other major central banks have begun the process of removing or reducing monetary accommodation, increasing the risk of recession and may also negatively impact asset values and credit spreads that were impacted by extraordinary monetary stimulus. these potential negative effects on financial markets and economic activity could lead to reduced revenues, increased costs, increased credit risks and volatile markets, and could negatively impact fifth thirds businesses, results of operations and financial condition.
changes in interest rates could affect fifth thirds income and cash flows.
fifth thirds income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond fifth thirds control, including general economic conditions in the u.s. or abroad and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies (in particular, the frb). changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment speed of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding as well as customers ability to repay loans.
32  fifth third bancorp the impact of these changes may be magnified if fifth third does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. fluctuations in these areas may adversely affect fifth third, its customers and its shareholders.
changes and trends in the capital markets may affect fifth thirds income and cash flows.
fifth third enters into and maintains trading and investment positions in the capital markets on its own behalf and manages investment positions on behalf of its customers. these investment positions include derivative financial instruments. the revenues and profits fifth third derives from managing proprietary and customer trading and investment positions are dependent on market prices. market changes and trends may result in a decline in wealth and asset management revenue or investment or trading losses that may impact fifth third. losses on behalf of its customers could expose fifth third to reputational issues, litigation, credit risks or loss of revenue from those clients and customers. additionally, losses in fifth thirds trading and investment positions could lead to a loss with respect to those investments and may adversely affect fifth thirds income, cash flows and funding costs.
fifth thirds stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. these factors include, without limitation:
●   changes in analysts recommendations or projections;
●   fifth thirds announcements of developments related to its businesses;
●   operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;
●   actions by government regulators and changes in the regulatory regime;
●   new technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors;
●   news reports of trends, concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry;
●   u.s. and global economic conditions;
●   geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism, military conflicts and withdrawal from the eu by the u.k. or other eu members.
the price for shares of fifth thirds common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to fifth thirds performance. general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price for shares of fifth thirds common stock and the current market price of such shares may not be indicative of future market prices.
fifth third earns revenue from the fees it receives for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. when rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall, reducing the revenue fifth third receives from loan originations. at the same time, revenue from msrs can increase through increases in fair value. when rates fall, mortgage originations tend to increase and the value of msrs tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. even though the origination of mortgage loans can act as a natural hedge, the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. for example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential msrs is immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the msrs relating to the new loans would accrue over time. it is also possible that even if interest rates were to fall, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the msrs value caused by the lower rates.
fifth third typically uses derivatives and other instruments to hedge its mortgage banking interest rate risk. fifth third generally does not hedge all of its risks and the fact that fifth third attempts to hedge any of the risks does not mean fifth third will be successful. hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring. fifth third may use hedging instruments tied to u.s. treasury rates, libor or eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. fifth third could incur significant losses from its hedging activities. there may be periods where fifth third elects not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk.
legal risks fifth third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations and litigation, regulatory or other enforcement proceedings by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse consequences.
fifth third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies, regarding their respective customers and businesses, as well as their sales practices, data security, product offerings, compensation practices and other compliance issues. also, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution may give rise to an inquiry or investigation by regulators or other authorities of the same or similar practices by fifth third. in addition, the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the u.s. means that a single event or topic may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings. in addition, fifth third and certain of its directors and officers have been named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and other litigation relating to fifth thirds business and activities, as well as regulatory or other enforcement proceedings. past, present and future litigation have included or could include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. enforcement authorities may seek admissions of wrongdoing and, in some cases, criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters and any such resolution of a matter involving fifth third which could lead to increased exposure to private litigation, could adversely affect fifth thirds reputation and could result in limitations on fifth thirds ability to do business in certain jurisdictions.
33  fifth third bancorp each of the matters described above may result in material adverse consequences, including without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of fifth thirds sec filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures. in addition, responding to information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter, could be time-consuming and expensive.
like other large financial institutions and companies, fifth third is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or other enforcement action against fifth third could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm to its business. the outcome of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate. although fifth third establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, fifth third does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. in addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to fifth third from the legal proceedings in question. thus, fifth thirds ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect fifth thirds results of operations.
in addition, there has been a trend of public settlements with governmental agencies that may adversely affect other financial institutions, to the extent such settlements are used as a template for future settlements. the uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and actual settlements or penalties.
for further information on specific legal and regulatory proceedings refer to note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
fifth third sells residential mortgage loans to various parties, including gses and other financial institutions that purchase residential mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. fifth third may be required to repurchase residential mortgage loans, indemnify the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a specified period (usually 60 days or less) after fifth third receives notice of the breach. contracts for residential mortgage loan sales to the gses include various types of specific remedies and penalties that could be applied to inadequate responses to repurchase requests. if economic conditions and the housing market deteriorate or future investor repurchase demand and fifth thirds success at appealing repurchase requests differ from past experience, fifth third could have increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases, requiring material additions to the repurchase reserve.
strategic risks if fifth third does not respond to intense competition and rapid changes in the financial services industry or otherwise adapt to changing customer preferences, its financial performance may suffer.
fifth thirds ability to deliver strong financial performance and returns on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of its customers. in addition to the challenge of competing against other banks in attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, fifth thirds competitors also include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and specialty finance, telecommunications, technology and insurance companies as well as large retailers who seek to offer one-stop financial services in addition to other products and services desired by consumers that may include services that banks have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past or may not be currently able or allowed to offer. many of these other firms may be significantly larger than fifth third and may have access to customers and financial resources that are beyond fifth thirds capability. fifth third competes with these firms with respect to capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price.
this increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in customer preferences, regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, as well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. rapidly changing technology and consumer preferences may require fifth third to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services in order to compete and meet customer demands. fifth third may not be able to do so or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. as a result, fifth thirds ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and its business, financial condition or results of operations, may be adversely affected.
fifth third may make strategic investments and may expand an existing line of business or enter into new lines of business to remain competitive. if fifth thirds chosen strategies, for example, the northstar strategy initiatives, are not appropriate to allow fifth third to effectively compete or fifth third does not execute them in an appropriate or timely manner, fifth thirds business and results may suffer. additionally, these strategies, products and lines of business may bring with them unforeseeable or unforeseen risks and may not generate the expected results or returns, which could adversely affect fifth thirds results of operations or future growth prospects and cause fifth third to fail to meet its stated goals and expectations.
changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact fifth thirds investments in its bank premises and equipment and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel.
fifth third has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network including its 1,121 full-service banking centers and 28 parcels of land held for the development of future banking centers of which 15 properties are developed or in the process of being developed as branches, as well as its retail work force and other branch banking assets.
34  fifth third bancorp advances in technology such as e-commerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences for these other methods of accessing fifth thirds products and services, could affect the value of fifth thirds branch network or other retail distribution assets and may cause it to change its retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force. further advances in technology and/or changes in customer preferences could have additional changes in fifth thirds retail distribution strategy and/or branch network. these actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel.
difficulties in identifying suitable opportunities or combining the operations of acquired entities or assets with fifth thirds own operations or assessing the effectiveness of businesses in which we make strategic investments or with which we enter into strategic contractual relationships may prevent fifth third from achieving the expected benefits from these acquisitions, investments or relationships.
inherent uncertainties exist when assessing, acquiring or integrating the operations of another business or investment or relationship opportunity. fifth third may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies relevant to an acquisition or strategic relationship. in addition, the markets and industries in which fifth third and its potential acquisition and investment targets operate are highly competitive. acquisition or investment targets may lose customers or otherwise perform poorly or unprofitably, or in the case of an acquired business or strategic relationship, cause fifth third to lose customers or perform poorly or unprofitably. future acquisition and investment activities and efforts to monitor newly acquired businesses or reap the benefits of a new strategic relationship may require fifth third to devote substantial time and resources and may cause these acquisitions, investments and relationships to be unprofitable or cause fifth third to be unable to pursue other business opportunities.
after completing an acquisition, fifth third may find that certain material information was not adequately disclosed during the due diligence process or that certain items were not accounted for properly in accordance with financial accounting and reporting standards. fifth third may also not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity or assets. for example, fifth third could experience higher charge-offs than originally anticipated related to the acquired loan portfolio. additionally, acquired companies or businesses may increase fifth thirds risk of regulatory action or restrictions related to the operations of the acquired business.
future acquisitions may dilute current shareholders ownership of fifth third and may cause fifth third to become more susceptible to adverse economic events.
future business acquisitions could be material to fifth third and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests. acquisitions also could require fifth third to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt. in those events, fifth third could become more susceptible to economic downturns, dislocations in capital markets and competitive pressures.
fifth third may sell or consider selling one or more of its businesses or investments. should it determine to sell such a business or investment, it may not be able to generate gains on sale or related increase in shareholders equity commensurate with desirable levels. moreover, if fifth third sold such businesses or investments, the loss of income could have an adverse effect on its earnings and future growth.
fifth third owns, or owns a minority stake in, as applicable, several non-strategic businesses, investments and other assets that are not significantly synergistic with its core financial services businesses or, in the future, may no longer be aligned with fifth thirds strategic plans or regulatory expectations. if fifth third were to sell one or more of its businesses or investments, it would be subject to market forces that may affect the timing, pricing or result in an unsuccessful sale. if fifth third were to complete the sale of any of its businesses, investments and/or interests in third parties, it would lose the income from the sold businesses and/or interests, including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and such loss of income could have an adverse effect on its future earnings and growth. additionally, fifth third may encounter difficulties in separating the operations of any businesses it sells, which may affect its business or results of operations.
general business risks changes in accounting standards or interpretations could impact fifth thirds reported earnings and financial condition.
the accounting standard setters, including the fasb, the sec and other regulatory agencies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of fifth thirds consolidated financial statements. for example, in june 2016, the fasb issued a new current expected credit loss rule, which will require banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset portfolio on loans and held-to-maturity securities, as opposed to the current practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred. for additional information, refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how fifth third records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. in some cases, fifth third could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the recasting of fifth thirds prior period financial statements.
fifth third uses models for business planning purposes that may not adequately predict future results.
fifth third uses financial models to aid in its planning for various purposes including its capital and liquidity needs and other purposes. the models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. as a result of these potential failures, fifth third may not adequately prepare for future events and may suffer losses or other setbacks due to these failures.
also, information fifth third provides to the public or to its regulators based on models could be inaccurate or misleading due to inadequate design or implementation, for example. decisions that its regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to its shareholders, could be affected adversely due to the perception that the models used to generate the relevant information are unreliable or inadequate.
35  fifth third bancorp the preparation of financial statements requires fifth third to make subjective determinations and use estimates that may vary from actual results and materially impact its results of operations or financial position.
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. if new information arises that results in a material change to a reserve amount, such a change could result in a change to previously announced financial results. refer to the critical accounting policies section of md&a for more information regarding managements significant estimates.
weather-related events or other natural disasters may have an effect on the performance of fifth thirds loan portfolios, especially in its coastal markets, thereby adversely impacting its results of operations.
fifth thirds footprint stretches from the upper midwestern to lower southeastern regions of the united states and it has offices in many other areas of the country. some of these regions have experienced weather events including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires and other natural disasters. the nature and level of these events and the impact of global climate change upon their frequency and severity cannot be predicted. if large scale events occur, they may significantly impact its loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral as well as impairing its borrowers ability to repay their loans.
fifth thirds actual or alleged conduct in activities, such as certain sales and lending practices, data security, corporate governance and acquisitions, behavior of employees, association with particular customers, business partners, investment or vendors, as well as developments from any of the other risks described above, may result in negative public opinion and may damage fifth thirds reputation. actions taken by government regulators, shareholder activists and community organizations may also damage fifth thirds reputation. additionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the advent and expansion of social media facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation. though fifth third monitors social media channels, the potential remains for rapid and widespread dissemination of inaccurate, misleading or false information that could damage fifth thirds reputation. negative public opinion can adversely affect fifth thirds ability to attract and keep customers and can increase the risk that it will be a target of litigation and regulatory action.
risks related to merger with mb financial, inc. (mb financial)
the acquisition of mb financial will dilute current shareholders ownership of fifth third and may cause fifth third to become more susceptible to adverse economic events.
fifth third will issue a substantial number of additional shares of stock in its merger with mb financial, which will dilute current shareholders ownership interests and increase fifth thirds dividend payments. fifth third will also use substantial cash or other liquid assets or incur debt to fund the merger. this liquidity need combined with 2019 maturities and liquidity needed to satisfy rating agency requirements will elevate capital markets execution risk. as a result, fifth third could become more susceptible to economic downturns, market conditions and competitive pressures.
fifth third and mb financial will incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the merger.
each of fifth third and mb financial has incurred and expects that it will incur additional significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the merger. in addition, fifth third will incur additional integration costs following the completion of the merger as fifth third integrates the businesses of the two companies, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. there can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the combined businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time.
fifth third may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger and may face increased risks as a result of it.
inherent uncertainties exist when assessing, acquiring, or integrating the operations of another business or investment or relationship opportunity. fifth third may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in its acquisition of mb financial, inc. additionally, fifth third may face additional risks as a result of the acquisition.
the success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend on, among other things, fifth thirds ability to combine the businesses of fifth third and mb financial in a manner that permits growth opportunities, including, among other things, enhanced revenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies, and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of fifth third or mb financial or result in decreased revenues due to any loss of customers. if fifth third is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the combined companys business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.
employees that fifth third wishes to retain may elect to terminate their employment as a result of the merger, which could delay or disrupt the integration process. it is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of fifth thirds or mb financials ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of fifth third or mb financial to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger.
after completing the acquisition, fifth third may find that certain material information was not adequately disclosed during the due diligence process or that certain items were not accounted for properly in accordance with financial accounting and reporting standards. fifth third may also not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition and may face increased risks pertaining to the acquired entity or assets. for example, fifth third could experience greater credit risk and higher charge-offs than originally anticipated related to the acquired loan portfolio. additionally, the acquisition may increase fifth thirds compliance and legal risks including increased litigation or regulatory actions such as fines or restrictions related to the business practices or operations of the acquired business.
36  fifth third bancorp regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.
before the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement can be completed, various approvals must be obtained from the bank regulatory and other governmental authorities. in deciding whether to grant these approvals, the relevant governmental entities will consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each of the parties and the effect of the merger on competition. an adverse development in either partys regulatory standing or other factors could result in an inability to obtain one or more of the required regulatory approvals or delay receipt of required approvals.
the frb has stated that if supervisory issues arise during processing of an application for approval of a merger transaction, a banking organization will be expected to withdraw its application pending resolution of such supervisory concerns. accordingly, if there is an adverse development in either partys regulatory standing, fifth third may be required to withdraw its application for approval of the proposed merger and, if possible, resubmit it after the applicable supervisory concerns have been resolved.
the terms of the approvals that are granted may impose conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined companys business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. nor can there be any assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger. additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
fifth third and mb financial believe that the proposed merger should not raise significant regulatory concerns and that fifth third will be able to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a timely manner. in addition, despite the parties commitments to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities, under the terms of the merger agreement, fifth third and mb financial will not be required to take actions that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on fifth third and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger (measured on a scale relative to mb financial and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole).
the merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed.
the merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the transaction. those conditions include: receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, absence of orders prohibiting completion of any of the proposed transactions, approval of the fifth third common shares to be issued in connection with the merger for listing on the nasdaq, the accuracy of the representations and warranties by both parties (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement), the performance by both parties of their covenants and agreements and the receipt by both parties of legal opinions from their respective tax counsels. these conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed. in addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, or fifth third or mb financial may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances, as set forth in the agreement.
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
the following is managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of certain significant factors that have affected fifth third bancorps (the bancorp or fifth third) financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements, which are a part of this filing. reference to the bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries. the bancorps banking subsidiary is referred to as the bank.
overview this overview of md&a highlights selected information in the financial results of the bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. for a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. each of these items could have an impact on the bancorps financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, refer to the glossary of abbreviations and acronyms in this report for a list of terms included as a tool for the reader of this annual report on form 10-k. the abbreviations and acronyms identified therein are used throughout this md&a, as well as the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements.
net interest income, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio are presented in md&a on an fte basis. the fte basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. the bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts. the fte basis for presenting net interest income is a non-gaap measure. for further information, refer to the non-gaap financial measures section of md&a.
the bancorps revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. for the year ended december 31, 2018, net interest income on an fte basis and noninterest income provided 60% and 40% of total revenue, respectively. the bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the u.s. from customers domiciled in the u.s. revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the bancorp. as discussed later in the risk management section of md&a, risk identification, assessment, management, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the bancorp.
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt. net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. generally, the rates of interest the bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. the change in market interest rates over time exposes the bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. the bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. the bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events, such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral.

2018 branch optimization plan customer interactions and service and sales activity in branch banking continue to evolve with changing demographics and technology applications. customers are increasingly utilizing digital tools to interact with their financial institutions in conducting their transactions while still utilizing physical branches for consultations and new product and service initiation. during the past three years, these developments and other business strategies led to a net decrease of 133 in the number of retail branches, or 11% of the bancorps total branch count, through consolidations and sales.
the bancorp continues to evaluate its retail network distribution in light of changes in customer behavior while developing new analytical tools that provide enhanced capabilities to optimize the profitability and growth potential of branches. in slower growth mature markets these developments enable the bancorp to achieve efficiencies through well-executed branch consolidations without materially impacting deposit flows and/or revenue growth while maintaining the service quality standards. while continuing to evaluate such actions, the bancorp is also focused on achieving higher retail household and deposit growth in other parts of its footprint  mainly in markets that exhibit faster economic growth and where the bancorp has significant opportunities to capture higher market share. to that extent, based on the strategic business evaluation that was performed during the second quarter of 2018, over the next 2-3 years, as part of the 2018 branch optimization plan, the bancorp plans to close between 100-125 branches in more mature markets and open between 100-125 new branches in higher growth markets where the bancorp already has an existing retail branch presence. with the existing local presence and familiarity with the customer demographics, and with newly developed analytical tools, the bancorp expects to achieve higher growth rates as a result of these actions.
as of december 31, 2018, the bancorp had closed 31 branches under the 2018 branch optimization plan. the bancorp expects to identify the remaining branches to be closed under the 2018 branch optimization plan prior to december 31, 2019. as part of the adoption of the 2018 branch optimization plan, the bancorp has also elected to sell 21 parcels of land which had previously been held for future branch expansion. for further information about the 2018 branch optimization plan, refer to note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
change in accounting policy effective in the fourth quarter of 2018, the bancorp changed its accounting policy for qualifying lihtc investments from the equity method to the proportional amortization method as it was managements determination to be the preferable method.
45  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the proportional amortization method provides an improved presentation for the reporting of these investments by presenting the investment performance net of taxes as a component of income tax expense, which more fairly represents the economics and provides users with a better understanding of the returns from such investments than the prior equity method. additionally, the proportional amortization method has been elected as a preferred accounting method for lihtc investments by many of the bancorps peers. changing the accounting policy for lihtc investments from the equity method of accounting to the proportional amortization method will make the bancorps presentation of the lihtc investments comparable to that of its peers. the adoption of the proportional amortization method was applied retrospectively and resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings by $134 million as of january 1, 2016. unless otherwise noted, all prior period information has been restated to conform to the accounting policy change. refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information including the impact of adoption on prior period financial statements.

earnings summary the bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2018 was $2.1 billion, or $3.06 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends. the bancorps net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $2.1 billion, or $2.81 per diluted share, which was net of $75 million in preferred stock dividends.
net interest income on an fte basis (non-gaap) was $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. net interest income was positively impacted by increases in yields on average loans and leases and average taxable securities and an increase in average taxable securities for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decisions of the fomc to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps in december 2017, march 2018, june 2018, september 2018 and december 2018. these positive impacts were partially offset by increases in the rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. net interest margin on an fte basis (non-gaap) was 3.22% and 3.03% for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
noninterest income decreased $434 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to a decrease in other noninterest income, partially offset by increases in corporate banking revenue, wealth and asset management revenue and card and processing revenue. other noninterest income decreased $470 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to the gain on sale of worldpay, inc. shares recognized in the prior year, a reduction in equity method income from the bancorps interest in worldpay holding, llc, the impact of the net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment and income from the tra associated with worldpay, inc. recognized in the prior year. these reductions were partially offset by the gain related to vantiv, inc.s acquisition of worldpay group plc., an increase in private equity investment income, as well as a decrease in the loss on the swap associated with the sale of visa, inc. class b shares. corporate banking revenue increased $85 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase from the prior year was primarily driven by increases in lease remarketing fees, institutional sales revenue, syndication fees and contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives. wealth and asset management revenue increased $25 million from the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in private client service fees and brokerage fees. card and processing revenue increased $16 million from the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to increases in the number of actively used cards and customer spend volume.
noninterest expense increased $146 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in personnel costs and technology and communications expenses, partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense. personnel costs increased $126 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 driven by increases in base compensation, performance-based compensation and severance costs. the increase in base compensation was primarily due to an increase in the bancorps minimum wage as a result of benefits received from the tcja and personnel additions associated with strategic investments and acquisitions.
46  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations technology and communications expense increased $40 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 driven primarily by increased investment in regulatory, compliance and growth initiatives. other noninterest expense decreased $17 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in the benefit from the reserve for unfunded commitments, gains on partnership investments and decreases in professional service fees and fdic insurance and other taxes, partially offset by increases in marketing expense and loan and lease expense.
for more information on net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense, refer to the statements of income analysis section of md&a.
credit summary the provision for loan and lease losses was $237 million and $261 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. net losses charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases decreased to 0.35% during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 0.32% during the year ended december 31, 2017. at december 31, 2018, nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and oreo decreased to 0.41% compared to 0.53% at december 31, 2017. for further discussion on credit quality, refer to the credit risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a.
capital summary the bancorps capital ratios exceed the well-capitalized guidelines as defined by the pca requirements of the u.s. banking agencies. as of december 31, 2018, as calculated under the basel iii standardized approach, the cet1 capital ratio was 10.24%, the tier i risk-based capital ratio was 11.32%, the total risk-based capital ratio was 14.48% and the tier i leverage ratio was 9.72%.
non-gaap financial measures the following are non-gaap measures which provide useful insight to the reader of the consolidated financial statements but should be supplemental to primary u.s. gaap measures and should not be read in isolation or relied upon as a substitute for the primary u.s. gaap measures.
the fte basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. the bancorp believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.
the following table reconciles the non-gaap financial measures of net interest income on an fte basis, interest income on an fte basis, net interest margin, net interest rate spread and the efficiency ratio to u.s. gaap:

average interest-bearing liabilities (7)                                                  89,959                                  85,090                                  85,332
efficiency ratio on an fte basis (5) / ((1) + (4))                                          56.5                                    53.7                                    59.3
the bancorp believes return on average tangible common equity is an important measure for comparative purposes with other financial institutions, but is not defined under u.s. gaap, and therefore is considered a non-gaap financial measure. this measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization.
47  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table reconciles the non-gaap financial measure of return on average tangible common equity to u.s. gaap:

the bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio and tangible common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by the u.s. banking agencies. these calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by the u.s. banking agencies for both absolute and comparative purposes. because u.s. gaap does not include capital ratio measures, the bancorp believes there are no comparable u.s. gaap financial measures to these ratios. these ratios are not formally defined by u.s. gaap or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, are considered to be non-gaap financial measures. the bancorp encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
the following table reconciles non-gaap capital ratios to u.s. gaap:

48  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent accounting standards note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards applicable to the bancorp during 2018 and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted.
critical accounting policies the bancorps consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the bancorps financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the bancorps critical accounting policies include the accounting for the alll, reserve for unfunded commitments, income taxes, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements, goodwill and legal contingencies. there have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models described below during the year ended december 31, 2018.
alll the bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the alll. the bancorps portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage and consumer. the bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. for an analysis of the bancorps alll by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, refer to note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the bancorp maintains the alll to absorb probable loan and lease losses inherent in its portfolio segments. the alll is maintained at a level the bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans and leases. credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the alll. provisions for loan and lease losses are based on the bancorps review of the historical credit loss experience and such factors that, in managements judgment, deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable credit losses. the bancorps strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collections standards. the strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.
the bancorps methodology for determining the alll requires significant management judgment and is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a tdr and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. allowances on individual commercial loans, tdrs and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when evaluating allowances for pools of loans.
larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a tdr, are subject to individual review for impairment. the bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the guarantors liquidity and willingness to cooperate, the loan structure and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. other factors may include the industry and geographic region of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the bancorps evaluation of the borrowers management. when individual loans are impaired, allowances are determined based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow, as well as an evaluation of legal options available to the bancorp. allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. the bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.
historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. the loss rates are derived from migration analyses for several portfolio stratifications, which track the historical net charge-off experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade. the risk grading system utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories.
homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks and allowances are established based on the expected net charge-offs. loss rates are based on the trailing twelve month net charge-off history by loan category. historical loss rates may be adjusted for certain prescriptive and qualitative factors that, in managements judgment, are necessary to reflect losses inherent in the portfolio. the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, ltv trends, refreshed fico score trends and product mix.
the bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the alll. these include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. the bancorp considers home price index trends in its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.
when evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the bancorps customers. refer to the allowance for credit losses subsection of the risk management section of md&a for a discussion on the bancorps alll sensitivity analysis.
reserve for unfunded commitments the reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. the determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. this process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the bancorps alll, as previously discussed. net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
49  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes the income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which the bancorp operates are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. the bancorp evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information. the bancorp maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these items.
changes in the estimate of tax accruals occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretation of tax laws and regulations and other guidance issued by tax authorities and the status of examinations conducted by tax authorities, as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations. these changes may significantly impact the bancorps tax accruals, deferred taxes and income tax expense and may significantly impact the operating results of the bancorp.
deferred taxes are determined using the balance sheet method. under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is calculated based on the difference between the book and tax bases of the assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws. significant management judgment is required to determine the realizability of deferred tax assets. deferred tax assets are recognized when management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. where management has determined that it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be realized, a valuation allowance is maintained. for additional information on income taxes, refer to note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
valuation of servicing rights when the bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it often obtains servicing rights. the bancorp may also purchase servicing rights. effective january 1, 2017, the bancorp elected to prospectively adopt the fair value method for all existing classes of its residential mortgage servicing rights portfolio. upon this election, all servicing rights in these classes are measured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of servicing rights are reported in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. servicing rights are valued using internal oas models. significant management judgment is necessary to identify key economic assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the servicing rights including the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the oas spread and the weighted-average coupon rate, as applicable. the primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds. in order to assist in the assessment of the fair value of servicing rights, the bancorp obtains external valuations of the servicing rights portfolio from third parties and participates in peer surveys that provide additional confirmation of the reasonableness of key assumptions utilized in the internal oas model. prior to the election of the fair value method, servicing rights were initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue. servicing rights were assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and other-than-temporary impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. for additional information on servicing rights, refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
fair value measurements the bancorp measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with u.s. gaap, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. the bancorp employs various valuation approaches to measure fair value including the market, income and cost approaches. the market approach uses prices or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. the income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.
u.s. gaap establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. for additional information on the fair value hierarchy and fair value measurements, refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the bancorps fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available. valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the bancorp on a quarterly basis. additionally, the bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness. the level of management judgment necessary to determine fair value varies based upon the methods used in the determination of fair value. financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets (level 1) require minimal judgment. the valuation of financial instruments when quoted market prices are not available (levels 2 and 3) may require significant management judgment to assess whether quoted prices for similar instruments exist, the impact of changing market conditions including reducing liquidity in the capital markets and the use of estimates surrounding significant unobservable inputs. table 6 provides a summary of the fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis and the amounts of financial instruments valued using level 3 inputs.

refer to note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on fair value measurements including a description of the valuation methodologies used for significant financial instruments.
goodwill business combinations entered into by the bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. u.s. gaap requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the bancorps reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the bancorp is september 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on the methodology used by the bancorp to assess goodwill for impairment.
impairment exists when a reporting units carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. in testing goodwill for impairment, u.s. gaap permits the bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. in this qualitative assessment, the bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to, the general economic environment, banking industry and market conditions, the overall financial performance of the bancorp, the performance of the bancorps common stock, the key financial performance metrics of the bancorps reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the two-step impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the bancorp would be required to perform the first step (step 1) of the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, step 2 of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
the fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. as none of the bancorps reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the bancorps stock price. the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. the bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting units forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting units estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting units forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections, growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results. additionally, the bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the bancorps stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and compares this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the bancorps reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach.
when required to perform step 2, the bancorp compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is recognized. a recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers.
during step 2, the bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. significant management judgment is necessary in the identification and valuation of unrecognized intangible assets and the valuation of the reporting units recorded assets and liabilities. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. this assignment process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. the bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), nor does it recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements as a result of this assignment process. refer to note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the bancorps goodwill.
legal contingencies the bancorp and its subsidiaries are parties to numerous claims and lawsuits as well as threatened or potential actions or claims concerning matters arising from the conduct of its business activities. the outcome of claims or litigation and the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgment may be required in the determination of both the probability of loss and whether the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. the bancorps estimates are subjective and are based on the status of legal and regulatory proceedings, the merit of the bancorps defenses and consultation with internal and external legal counsel. an accrual for a potential litigation loss is established when information related to the loss contingency indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. refer to note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the bancorps legal proceedings.
51  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements of income analysis net interest income net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases (including yield-related fees), securities and other short-term investments less the interest paid for core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, other short-term borrowings and long-term debt). the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterest-bearing liabilities, or free funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders equity.
tables 7 and 8 present the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest rate spread for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as well as the relative impact of changes in the average balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income. nonaccrual loans and leases and loans and leases held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt and other securities included in average other assets.
net interest income on an fte basis (non-gaap) was $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. net interest income was positively impacted by increases in yields on average loans and leases of 58 bps and yields on average taxable securities of 13 bps for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. net interest income also benefited from an increase in average taxable securities of $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. additionally, net interest income was positively impacted by the decisions of the fomc to raise the target range of the federal funds rate 25 bps in december 2017, march 2018, june 2018, september 2018 and december 2018. these positive impacts were partially offset by increases in the rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the rates paid on average interest-bearing core deposits and average long-term debt increased 33 bps and 32 bps, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year.
net interest rate spread on an fte basis (non-gaap) was 2.87% during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 2.76% during the year ended december 31, 2017. yields on average interest-earning assets increased 46 bps, partially offset by a 35 bps increase in rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017.
net interest margin on an fte basis (non-gaap) was 3.22% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 3.03% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2018 was driven primarily by the previously mentioned increase in the net interest rate spread partially offset by a decrease in average free funding balances. the decrease in average free funding balances was driven by a decrease in average demand deposits of $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017.
interest income on an fte basis from loans and leases (non-gaap) increased $590 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 driven by the previously mentioned increase in yields on average loans and leases, as well as an increase in the volume of average other consumer loans and average commercial and industrial loans. for more information on the bancorps loan and lease portfolio, refer to the loans and leases subsection of the balance sheet analysis section of md&a. interest income from investment securities and other short-term investments increased $94 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the aforementioned increases in average taxable securities and yields on average taxable securities.
interest expense on core deposits increased $250 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to an increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits to 70 bps for the year ended december 31, 2018 from 37 bps for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in the cost of average interest-bearing core deposits was primarily due to increases in the rates paid on average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits. refer to the deposits subsection of the balance sheet analysis section of md&a for additional information on the bancorps deposits.
interest expense on wholesale funding increased $102 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to the aforementioned increase in the rates paid on average long-term debt coupled with an increase in average long-term debt. refer to the borrowings subsection of the balance sheet analysis section of md&a for additional information on the bancorps borrowings. average wholesale funding represented 23% and 24% of average interest-bearing liabilities during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. for more information on the bancorps interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the market risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a.

provision for loan and lease losses the bancorp provides as an expense an amount for probable losses within the loan and lease portfolio that is based on factors previously discussed in the critical accounting policies section of md&a. the provision is recorded to bring the alll to a level deemed appropriate by the bancorp to cover losses inherent in the portfolio. actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the alll. the amount of loans and leases actually removed from the consolidated balance sheets is referred to as a charge-off. net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases.
the provision for loan and lease losses was $237 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $261 million for the same period in the prior year. the decrease in provision expense for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in the level of commercial criticized assets combined with overall improved credit quality, partially offset by an increase in outstanding commercial loan balances and an increase in consumer reserve rates for certain products. the alll declined $93 million from december 31, 2017 to $1.1 billion at december 31, 2018. at december 31, 2018, the alll as a percent of portfolio loans and leases decreased to 1.16%, compared to 1.30% at december 31, 2017.
refer to the credit risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a as well as note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the provision for loan and lease losses, including an analysis of loan and lease portfolio composition, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and other factors considered by the bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and the alll.

service charges on deposits service charges on deposits decreased $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to a decrease of $13 million in commercial deposit fees, partially offset by an increase of $8 million in consumer deposit fees.
wealth and asset management revenue wealth and asset management revenue increased $25 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase from the prior year was primarily due to increases of $16 million and $10 million, respectively, in private client service fees and brokerage fees. these increases were driven by an increase in average assets under management as a result of market performance and increased asset inflows during the year ended december 31, 2018. the bancorps trust and registered investment advisory businesses had approximately $356 billion and $362 billion in total assets under care as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and managed $37 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations as of both december 31, 2018 and 2017.
corporate banking revenue corporate banking revenue increased $85 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31,
2017. the increase from the prior year was primarily driven by increases in lease remarketing fees, institutional sales revenue, syndication fees and contract revenue from commercial customer derivatives of $46 million, $18 million, $13 million and $11 million, respectively. the increase in lease remarketing fees for the year ended december 31, 2018 included the impact of a $52 million impairment charge related to certain operating lease assets that was recognized during the year ended december 31, 2017. these benefits were partially offset by decreases of $7 million and $6 million, respectively, in letter of credit fees and business lending fees from the year ended december 31, 2017.

net losses on disposition and impairment of bank premises and equipment increased $43 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. this increase was driven by the impact of impairment charges of $45 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $7 million during the year ended december 31, 2017. for more information, refer to note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
private equity investment income increased $27 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to valuation adjustments on certain private equity investments. for the year ended december 31, 2018, the bancorp recognized negative valuation adjustments of $59 million related to the visa total return swap compared to negative valuation adjustments of $80 million during the year ended december 31, 2017. the decrease from the prior period was primarily attributable to the impact of litigation developments during 2017. for additional information on the valuation of the swap associated with the sale of visa, inc. class b shares, refer to note 16, note 17 and note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased $146 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily due to increases in personnel costs (salaries, wages and incentives plus employee benefits) and technology and communications expense, partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense. additionally, the bancorp recognized $31 million in merger-related expenses for the year ended december 31, 2018.

(benefit from) provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments            (30   )               -              23
other noninterest expense decreased $17 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in the benefit from the reserve for unfunded commitments, gains on partnership investments and decreases in professional service fees and fdic insurance and other taxes, partially offset by increases in marketing expense and loan and lease expense.
the benefit from the reserve for unfunded commitments increased $30 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to overall improved credit quality. gains on partnership investments were $4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to losses of $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2017. professional service fees decreased $16 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to decreases in legal and consulting fees. fdic insurance and other taxes decreased $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to the elimination of the fdic surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018. marketing expense increased $33 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to promotional offers during the year ended december 31, 2018. loan and lease expense increased $10 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017 driven by an increase in loan servicing expenses on point-of-sale loans as a result of growth in point-of-sale originations.
applicable income taxes applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit from tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments, certain gains on sales of leveraged leases that are exempt from federal taxation and tax credits (and other related tax benefits), partially offset by the effect of proportional amortization of qualifying lihtc investments and certain nondeductible expenses. the tax credits are associated with the low-income housing tax credit program established under section 42 of the irc, the new markets tax credit program established under section 45d of the irc, the rehabilitation investment tax credit program established under section 47 of the irc and the qualified zone academy bond program established under section 1397e of the irc.
the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 were primarily impacted by $189 million and $206 million, respectively, of low-income housing tax credits and other tax benefits and $23 million and $34 million of tax benefits from tax exempt income in 2018 and 2017, respectively and were partially offset by $154 million and $223 million of proportional amortization related to qualifying lihtc investments. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2017 was also impacted by a $253 million benefit from the remeasurement of deferred taxes as a result of the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for years beginning after december 31, 2017. the decrease in the effective tax rate from the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred taxes mentioned above, partially offset by the impact of an increase in income before taxes.
the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the tcja, on december 22, 2017. the tcja made broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code including, but not limited to, reducing the federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017. u.s. gaap requires the bancorp to recognize the tax effects of changes in tax laws and rates on its deferred taxes in the period in which the law is enacted. as a result, for the year ended december 31, 2017, the bancorp remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $253 million. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the bancorp was subject to a federal statutory corporate tax rate of 35 percent. for years beginning after december 31, 2017, the bancorp is subject to a federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21 percent.
for stock-based awards, u.s. gaap requires that the tax consequences for the difference between the expense recognized for financial reporting and the bancorps actual tax deduction for the stock-based awards be recognized through income tax expense in the interim periods in which they occur. the bancorp cannot predict its stock price or whether and when its employees will exercise stock-based awards in the future. based on its stock price at december 31, 2018, the bancorp estimates that it may be necessary to recognize $6 million of additional income tax benefit over the next twelve months related to the settlement of stock-based awards, primarily in the first half of 2019. however, the amount of income tax expense or benefit recognized upon settlement may vary significantly from expectations based on the bancorps stock price and the number of sars exercised by employees.

59  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segment review the bancorp reports on four business segments: commercial banking, branch banking, consumer lending and wealth and asset management. additional information on each business segment is included in note 29 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. results of the bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. the structure and accounting practices are specific to the bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. the bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices and businesses change.
the bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level. by employing an ftp methodology, the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits. the ftp methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities, respectively, based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction. assigning the ftp rate based on matching the duration of the cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates. the bancorps ftp methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the asset-generating and deposit-providing businesses on a duration-adjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance. as the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched, the residual impact of the ftp methodology is captured in general corporate and other. the charge and credit rates are determined using the ftp rate curve, which is based on an estimate of fifth thirds marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets. the ftp curve is constructed using the u.s. swap curve, brokered cd pricing and unsecured debt pricing.
the bancorp adjusts the ftp charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions, such as prepayment rates on interest-earning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminate-lived deposits. key assumptions, including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts, are reviewed annually. credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions. the credit rates for several deposit products were reset january 1, 2018 to reflect the current market rates and updated market assumptions. these rates were generally higher than those in place during 2017, thus net interest income for deposit-providing business segments was positively impacted during 2018. ftp charge rates on assets were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio. as overall market rates increased, the ftp charge increased for asset-generating business segments during 2018.
the bancorps methodology for allocating provision for loan and lease losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment. provision for loan and lease losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in alll factors is captured in general corporate and other. the financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and funding operations by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit.
the results of operations and financial position for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 were adjusted to reflect changes in internal expense allocation methodologies as well as a change in accounting policy for qualifying lihtc investments.

total loans and leases increased $3.4 billion from december 31, 2017. the increase from december 31, 2017 was the result of a $3.2 billion, or 6%, increase in commercial loans and leases as well as a $170 million increase in consumer loans.
commercial loans and leases increased from december 31, 2017 due to increases in commercial and industrial loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial construction loans, partially offset by a decrease in commercial leases. commercial and industrial loans increased $3.2 billion, or 8%, from december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in loan originations, a decrease in payoffs and an increase in drawn balances on existing revolving lines of credit during the year ended december 31, 2018. commercial mortgage loans increased $367 million, or 6% from december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in loan originations and increases in permanent financing from the bancorps commercial construction loan portfolio. commercial construction loans increased $104 million, or 2%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in draw levels on existing commitments.
consumer loans and leases increased from december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in other consumer loans and credit card, partially offset by a decrease in home equity and automobile loans. other consumer loans increased $783 million, or 50%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to growth in point-of-sale loan originations. credit card increased $171 million, or 7%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in balance active customers and an increase in card usage resulting in an increase in the average balance per active customer. home equity decreased $612 million, or 9%, from december 31, 2017 as payoffs exceeded new loan production. automobile loans decreased $136 million, or 1%, from december 31, 2017 as payoffs exceeded new loan production due to a strategic shift focusing on improving risk-adjusted returns.

total average loans and leases increased $1.1 billion, or 1%, from december 31, 2017 as a result of a $1.1 billion, or 2%, increase in average commercial loans and leases and a $34 million increase in average consumer loans.
72  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations average commercial and industrial loans increased $1.1 billion, or 3%, from december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of an increase in loan originations, a decrease in payoffs and an increase in drawn balances on existing revolving lines of credit. average commercial construction loans increased $419 million, or 10%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in draw levels on existing commitments. average commercial leases decreased $216 million, or 5%, from december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of a planned reduction in indirect non-relationship based lease originations. average commercial mortgage loans decreased $183 million, or 3%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in paydowns in the fourth quarter of 2017 and lower loan origination activity through the first two quarters of 2018.
average consumer loans increased from december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in other consumer loans, credit card and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases in home equity and automobile loans. average other consumer loans increased $889 million, or 88%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to growth in point-of-sale loan originations. average credit card increased $139 million, or 6%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in balance active customers and an increase in card usage resulting in an increase in the average balance per active customer. average residential mortgage loans increased $97 million, or 1%, from december 31, 2017 primarily driven by the continued retention of certain agency conforming arms and certain other fixed-rate loans. average home equity decreased $677 million, or 9%, from december 31, 2017 as payoffs exceeded new loan production. average automobile loans decreased $414 million, or 4%, from december 31, 2017 as payoffs exceeded new loan production due to a strategic shift focusing on improving risk-adjusted returns.
investment securities the bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing collateral for pledging purposes and for liquidity to satisfy regulatory requirements. total investment securities were $33.6 billion and $32.7 billion at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively. the taxable available-for-sale debt and other investment securities portfolio had an effective duration of 5.0 years at december 31, 2018 compared to 4.7 years at december 31, 2017.
debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when, in managements judgment, they may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in market conditions. securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. debt securities are classified as trading when bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. at december 31, 2018, the bancorps investment portfolio consisted primarily of aaa-rated available-for-sale debt and other securities. the bancorp held an immaterial amount in below-investment grade available-for-sale debt and other securities at both december 31, 2018 and 2017. for the year ended december 31, 2018 the bancorp did not recognize any otti on its available-for-sale debt and other securities. for the year ended december 31, 2017 the bancorp recognized $54 million of otti on its available-for-sale debt and other securities, included in securities (losses) gains, net, in the consolidated statements of income. refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the bancorps methodology for both classifying investment securities and evaluating securities in an unrealized loss position for otti.

73  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities increased $1.6 billion, or 5%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in agency residential mortgage-backed securities and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by decreases in asset-backed securities and other debt securities.
on an amortized cost basis, available-for-sale debt and other securities were 25% of total interest-earning assets at both december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017. the estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio was 6.5 years at both december 31, 2018 and 2017. in addition, at december 31, 2018 and 2017 the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 3.25% and 3.18%, respectively.
trading debt securities decreased $205 million from december 31, 2017 primarily due to a decrease in agency residential mortgage-backed securities.
information presented in table 25 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. yield information is presented on an fte basis and is computed using amortized cost balances. maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio exclude other securities that have no stated yield or maturity. total net unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio were $298 million at december 31, 2018 compared to net unrealized gains of $174 million at december 31, 2017. the fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. the fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase or when credit spreads expand.

core deposits increased $5.6 billion, or 6%, from december 31, 2017, driven by increases of $4.9 billion and $715 million in transaction deposits and other time deposits, respectively. transaction deposits increased from december 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in interest checking deposits and money market deposits partially offset by a decrease in demand deposits. interest checking deposits increased $6.4 billion, or 23%, from december 31, 2017 driven primarily by balance migration from demand deposit accounts and higher balances per commercial customer account as well as the acquisition of new commercial customers. money market deposits increased $2.5 billion, or 12%, from december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of promotional rate offers facilitated by the rising-rate environment and growth in the fifth third preferred banking program. demand deposits decreased $3.2 billion, or 9%, from december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the aforementioned commercial customer balance migration into interest checking deposits and lower balances per commercial customer account. other time deposits increased from december 31, 2017 primarily due to promotional rate offers facilitated by the rising-rate environment.

deposits
$1.4 billion, $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion of average institutional, retail and wholesale certificates $250,000 and over during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
on an average basis, core deposits increased $2.2 billion from december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase of $1.9 billion and $335 million in average transaction deposits and average other time deposits, respectively. the increase in average transaction deposits was driven by increases in average interest checking deposits and average money market deposits partially offset by a decrease in average demand deposits. average interest checking deposits increased $3.4 billion, or 13%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to balance migration from demand deposit accounts and an increase in average balances per commercial customer account as well as the acquisition of new commercial customers. average money market deposits increased $1.5 billion, or 8%, from december 31, 2017 as a result of promotional rate offers facilitated by the rising-rate environment and growth in the fifth third preferred banking program. average demand deposits decreased $2.5 billion, or 7%, from december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the aforementioned migration into interest checking deposits and lower average balances per commercial customer account. the increase in average other time deposits was primarily due to promotional rate offers facilitated by the rising-rate environment.

$100,000 and over the contractual maturities of other time deposits and certificates $100,000 and over as of december 31, 2018 are summarized in the following table:
table 29: contractual maturities of other time deposits and certificates $100,000 and over
deposits and certificates $100,000 and over borrowings the bancorp accesses a variety of short-term and long-term funding sources. borrowings with original maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term and include federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings. average total borrowings as a percent of average interest-bearing liabilities were 20% at december 31, 2018 compared to 21% at december 31, 2017.
total borrowings decreased $2.2 billion, or 11%, from december 31, 2017 due to decreases in other short-term borrowings and long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in federal funds purchased. other short-term borrowings decreased $3.4 billion from december 31, 2017 driven by a decrease in fhlb advances. the level of other short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on funding needs and which sources are used to satisfy those needs. for further information on the components of other short-term borrowings, refer to note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. long-term debt decreased $478 million from december 31, 2017 primarily driven by the maturity of $1.9 billion of unsecured senior bank notes and $500 million of unsecured subordinated debt, $480 million of paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations and $44 million of fair value adjustments associated with interest rate swaps hedging long-term debt during the year ended december 31, 2018. these decreases were partially offset by the issuance of $1.3 billion of unsecured fixed-rate senior bank notes, $650 million of unsecured fixed-rate senior notes, $300 million of unsecured floating-rate senior bank notes and $250 million of unsecured floating-rate senior notes since december 31, 2017. for additional information regarding long-term debt issuances, refer to note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. federal funds purchased increased $1.8 billion from december 31, 2017 due to a reallocation of other short-term borrowings. for further information on subsequent events related to long-term debt, refer to note 31 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

total average borrowings increased $152 million, or 1%, compared to december 31, 2017, due to increases in average federal funds purchased and average long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in average other short-term borrowings. average federal funds purchased increased $952 million due to a reallocation of other short-term borrowings.
76  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations average long-term debt increased $747 million compared to december 31, 2017. the increase was driven primarily by the issuances of long-term debt during the second half of 2017 which consisted of $750 million of unsecured fixed-rate senior bank notes and $300 million of unsecured floating-rate senior bank notes and the issuances during the year ended december 31, 2018, as discussed above. the increase was partially offset by the maturities of unsecured senior bank notes and subordinated debt and paydowns on long-term debt associated with automobile loan securitizations, as discussed above, during the year ended december 31, 2018. average other short-term borrowings decreased $1.5 billion compared to december 31, 2017, driven primarily by the aforementioned decrease in fhlb advances. information on the average rates paid on borrowings is discussed in the net interest income subsection of the statements of income analysis section of md&a. in addition, refer to the liquidity risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the bancorps liquidity management.
77  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management - overview risk management is critical for effectively serving customers financial needs while protecting the bancorp and achieving strategic goals. it is also essential to reducing the volatility of earnings and safeguarding the bancorps brand and reputation. further, risk management is integral to the bancorps strategic and capital planning processes. it is essential that the bancorps business strategies consistently align to its overall risk appetite and capital considerations. maintaining risks within the bancorps risk appetite requires that risks are understood by all employees across the enterprise, and appropriate risk mitigants and controls are in place to limit risk to within the risk appetite. to achieve this, the bancorp implements a framework for managing risk that encompasses business as usual activities and the utilization of a risk process for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks.
fifth third uses a structure consisting of three lines of defense in order to clarify the roles and responsibilities for effective risk management.
the risk taking functions within the lines of business comprise the first line of defense. the first line of defense originates risk through normal business as usual activities; therefore, it is essential that they monitor, assess and manage the risks being taken, implement controls necessary to mitigate those risks and take responsibility for managing their business within the bancorps risk appetite.
control functions, such as the risk management organization, are the second line of defense and are responsible for providing challenge, oversight and governance of activities performed by the first line.
the audit division is the third line of defense and provides an independent assessment of the bancorps internal control structure and related systems and processes. the credit risk review division provides an independent assessment of credit risk, which includes evaluating the sufficiency of underwriting, documentation and approval processes for consumer and commercial credits, the accuracy of risk grades assigned to commercial credit exposure, nonaccrual status, specific reserves and monitoring for charge-offs.
fifth thirds core values and culture provide a foundation for supporting sound risk management practices by setting expectations for appropriate conduct and accountability across the organization.
all employees are expected to conduct themselves in alignment with fifth thirds core values and code of business conduct & ethics, which may be found on www.53.com, while carrying out their responsibilities. fifth thirds corporate responsibility and reputation committee provides oversight of business conduct policies, programs and strategies, and monitors reporting of potential misconduct, trends or themes across the enterprise. prudent risk management is a responsibility that is expected from all employees across the first, second and third lines of defense and is a foundational element of fifth thirds culture.
below are the bancorps core principles of risk management that are used to ensure the bancorp is operating in a safe and sound manner:
●   understand the risks taken as a necessary part of business; however, the bancorp ensures risks taken are in alignment with its strategy and risk appetite.
●            ensure fifth thirds products and services are designed, delivered and maintained to provide value and benefit to its customers and to fifth third, and that potential opportunities remain aligned to the core customer base.
●   avoid risks that cannot be understood, managed and monitored.
●   act with integrity in all activities.
●   focus on providing operational excellence by providing reliable, accurate and efficient services to meet customers needs.
●   maintain a strong financial position to ensure that the bancorp meets its strategic objectives through all economic cycles and is able to access the capital markets at all times, even under stressed conditions.
●   protect the bancorps reputation by thoroughly understanding the consequences of business strategies, products and processes.
●   conduct business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and in alignment with internal policies and procedures.
fifth thirds success is dependent on effective risk management and understanding and controlling the risks taken in order to deliver sustainable returns for employees and shareholders. the bancorps goal is to ensure that aggregate risks do not exceed its risk capacity, and that risks taken are supportive of the bancorps portfolio diversification and profitability objectives.
fifth thirds risk management framework states its risk appetite and the linkage to strategic and capital planning, defines and sets the tolerance for each of the eight risk types, explains the process used to manage risk across the enterprise and sets forth its risk governance structure.
●                                                                             the board of directors (the board) and executive management define the risk appetite, which is considered in the development of business strategies, and forms the basis for enterprise risk management. the bancorps risk appetite is set annually in alignment with the strategic, capital and financial plans, and is reviewed by the board on an annual basis.
●                                                                          the risk management process provides a consistent and integrated approach for managing risks and ensuring appropriate risk mitigants and controls are in place, and risks and issues are appropriately escalated. five components are utilized for effective risk management; identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk.
●                                                                           the board and executive management have identified eight risk types for monitoring the overall risk of the bancorp; credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, regulatory compliance risk, legal risk, reputation risk and strategic risk, and have also qualitatively established a risk tolerance, which is defined as the maximum amount of risk the bancorp is willing to take for each of the eight risk types. these risk types are assessed on an ongoing basis and reported to the board each quarter, or more frequently, if necessary. in addition, each business and operational function (first line of defense) is accountable for proactively identifying and managing risk using its risk management process. risk tolerances and risk limits are also established, where appropriate, in order to ensure that business and operational functions across the enterprise are able to monitor and manage risks at a more granular level, while ensuring that aggregate risks across the enterprise do not exceed the overall risk appetite.
●   the bancorps risk governance structure includes management committees operating under delegation from, and providing information directly or indirectly to, the board.
78  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the bancorp board delegates certain responsibilities to board sub-committees, including the rcc as outlined in each respective committee charter, which may be found on www.53.com. the ermc, which reports to the rcc, comprises senior management from across the bancorp and reviews and approves risk management frameworks and
policies, oversees the management of all risk types to ensure that aggregated risks remain within the bancorps risk appetite and fosters a risk culture to ensure appropriate escalation and transparency of risks.
credit risk management the objective of the bancorps credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the bancorp. the bancorps credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. the bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below. these practices include the use of intentional risk-based limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance. the bancorp carefully designed and monitors underwriting, documentation and collection standards. the bancorps credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. underwriting activities are centrally managed, and erm manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. the credit risk review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. the bancorps credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. the bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses and take any necessary charge-offs. the bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan. refer to note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the bancorps credit grade categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions. in addition, stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios using the ccar model and for certain portfolios, such as real estate and leveraged lending, the stress testing is performed by credit department personnel at the individual loan level during credit underwriting.
the following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases:

in addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. the risk grading system currently utilized for allowance for credit loss analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. the bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing, portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a through-the-cycle rating philosophy for assessing a borrowers creditworthiness. a through-the-cycle rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance. the dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. the probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-category risk rating system. the bancorp has completed significant validation and testing of the dual risk rating system as a commercial credit risk management tool. the bancorp is assessing the necessary modifications to the dual risk rating system outputs to develop a u.s. gaap compliant alll model and will evaluate the use of modified dual risk ratings for purposes of determining the bancorps alll as part of the bancorps adoption of asu 2016-13 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, which will be effective for the bancorp on january 1, 2020. scoring systems, various analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring are used to assess the credit risk in the bancorps homogenous consumer and small business loan portfolios.
79  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview inflationary expectations have changed little and are expected to remain near 2% in the coming year. the labor market has continued to tighten and unemployment remains low. household spending has continued to show strong growth. the fomc stated that risks to the economic outlook are roughly balanced, but the committee will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook. market professionals continue to have an increased focus on wages, interest rates, input costs, tariffs, trade negotiations and foreign exchange. during december 2018, the fomc enacted an additional 25 bp increase in the target rate for federal funds. the federal reserve median forecast for change in 2019 real gdp is 2.41%, a slight decrease from the 3.1% rate in 2018. the federal reserve, in their minutes, continues to be concerned that tariffs could hurt the current economic recovery but are waiting to see evidence of any damage. also concerning is the recent slowdown in homebuilding. there is a chance of higher interest rates in 2019 that would generally be detrimental to the bancorps clients financial condition.
market data and vacancies remain positive. competition for term loans on stabilized or near-stabilized assets remains highly aggressive in terms of pricing, recourse and repayment structures, as banks seek to diversify away from construction. construction costs continue to escalate and will likely be exacerbated by the impact of tariffs. the bancorp is also monitoring potential increased risks in the retail sector as a result of changes in distribution models with increasing levels of online purchasing and recent weakness in certain specialty retailers. however, needs-based retail and online retailers moving to brick and mortar are supporting continued development and lease-up for mixed-use retail centers. the bancorp has been focused on tenants that have multi-channel distribution and/or provide entertainment such as restaurants, cosmetic stores, fitness, grocery and drug.
during the third quarter of 2018, the southeastern united states experienced a major hurricane impacting the eastern portions of the states of north carolina and south carolina. the bancorp has limited credit exposure in the coastal regions of both states; however, temporary assistance was provided to customers that were negatively impacted. there is no expectation of any material net charge-offs as a result of the hurricane.
commercial portfolio the bancorps credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification. the bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment, geography and credit product type. the risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting.
the bancorp provides loans to a variety of customers ranging from large multi-national firms to middle market businesses, sole proprietors and high net worth individuals. the origination policies for commercial and industrial loans outline the risks and underwriting requirements for loans to businesses in various industries. included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, collateral and leverage requirements, cash flow coverage measures and hold limits. the bancorp aligns credit and sales teams with specific industry expertise to better monitor and manage different industry segments of the portfolio.
the origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner and nonowner-occupied and construction lending. included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum ltvs, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable), pro-forma analysis requirements and interest rate sensitivity. the bancorp requires a valuation of real estate collateral, which may include third-party appraisals, be performed at the time of origination and renewal in accordance with regulatory requirements and on an as-needed basis when market conditions justify. although the bancorp does not back test these collateral value assumptions, the bancorp maintains an appraisal review department to order and review third-party appraisals in accordance with regulatory requirements. collateral values on criticized assets with relationships exceeding $1 million are reviewed quarterly to assess the appropriateness of the value ascribed in the assessment of charge-offs and specific reserves.
the bancorp assesses all real estate and non-real estate collateral securing a loan and considers all cross-collateralized loans in the calculation of the ltv ratio. the following tables provide detail on the most recent ltv ratios for commercial mortgage loans greater than $1 million, excluding impaired commercial mortgage loans individually evaluated. the bancorp does not typically aggregate the ltv ratios for commercial mortgage loans less than $1 million.
80  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table provides detail on commercial loan and leases by industry classification (as defined by the north american industry classification system), by loan size and by state, illustrating the diversity and granularity of the bancorps commercial loans and leases:

the bancorps nonowner-occupied commercial real estate portfolios have been identified by the bancorp as loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the bancorps commercial loan portfolio due to economic or market conditions within the bancorps key lending areas.
81  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following tables provide an analysis of nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans by state (excluding loans held for sale):
table 37: nonowner-occupied commercial real estate (excluding loans held for sale)(a)
as of december 31, 2018 ($ in millions)                                                                                                                                               for the year ended december 31, 2018
table 38: nonowner-occupied commercial real estate (excluding loans held for sale)(a)
as of december 31, 2017 ($ in millions)                                                                                                                                               for the year ended december 31, 2017
consumer portfolio consumer credit risk management utilizes a framework that encompasses consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting credit risk. these processes are supported by a credit risk governance structure that includes board oversight, policies, risk limits and risk committees.
the bancorps consumer portfolio is materially comprised of five categories of loans: residential mortgage loans, home equity, automobile loans, credit card and other consumer loans. the bancorp has identified certain credit characteristics within these five categories of loans which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio. the bancorp does not update ltv ratios for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the charge-off process for real estate secured loans. among consumer portfolios, legacy underwritten residential mortgage and brokered home equity portfolios exhibited the most stress during the past credit crisis. as of december 31, 2018, consumer real estate loans, consisting of residential mortgage loans and home equity loans, originated from 2005 through 2008 represent approximately 12% of the consumer real estate portfolio. these loans accounted for 47% of total consumer real estate secured losses for the year ended december 31, 2018. current loss rates in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are below pre-crisis levels. in addition to the consumer real estate portfolio, credit risk management continues to closely monitor the automobile portfolio performance. the automobile market has exhibited industry-wide gradual loosening of credit standards such as lower ficos, longer terms and higher ltvs. the bancorp has adjusted credit standards focused on improving risk-adjusted returns while maintaining credit risk tolerance. the bancorp actively manages the automobile portfolio through concentration limits, which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower fico scores, higher advance rates and extended term originations.
residential mortgage portfolio the bancorp manages credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio through underwriting guidelines that limit exposure to higher ltv ratios and lower fico scores. additionally, the portfolio is governed by concentration limits that ensure geographic, product and channel diversification. the bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio.
the bancorp does not originate residential mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. the bancorp originates both fixed-rate and arm loans. within the arm portfolio approximately $665 million of arm loans will have rate resets during the next twelve months. of these resets, 95% are expected to experience an increase in rate, with an average increase of approximately one percent. underlying characteristics of these borrowers are relatively strong with a weighted average origination dti of 33% and weighted average origination ltv of 74%.
certain residential mortgage products have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the bancorp in the event of a decline in housing values. these types of mortgage products offered by the bancorp include loans with high ltv ratios, multiple loans on the same collateral that when combined result in an ltv greater than 80% and interest-only loans.
82  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the bancorp has deemed residential mortgage loans with greater than 80% ltv ratios and no mortgage insurance as loans that represent a higher level of risk.

home equity portfolio the bancorps home equity portfolio is primarily comprised of home equity lines of credit. beginning in the first quarter of 2013, the bancorps newly originated home equity lines of credit have a 10-year interest-only draw period followed by a 20-year amortization period. the home equity line of credit previously offered by the bancorp was a revolving facility with a 20-year term, minimum payments of interest-only and a balloon payment of principal at maturity. peak maturity years for the balloon home equity lines of credit are 2025 to 2028 and approximately 26% of the balances mature before 2025.
the alll provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the home equity portfolio. the allowance attributable to the portion of the home equity portfolio that has not been restructured in a tdr is determined on a pooled basis with senior lien and junior lien categories segmented in the determination of the probable credit losses in the home equity portfolio. the loss factor for the home equity portfolio is based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate for each category, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends. the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, ltv trends and refreshed fico score trends.
83  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. the bancorp considers home price index trends in its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.
the home equity portfolio is managed in two primary groups: loans outstanding with a combined ltv greater than 80% and those loans with an ltv of 80% or less based upon appraisals at origination. for additional information on these loans, refer to table 43 and table 44. of the total $6.4 billion of outstanding home equity loans:
●   89% reside within the bancorps midwest footprint of ohio, michigan, kentucky, indiana and illinois as of december 31, 2018;
●   37% are in senior lien positions and 63% are in junior lien positions at december 31, 2018;
●   the portfolio had an average refreshed fico score of 745 at december 31, 2018.
the bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes adjustments in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on fico score deterioration and property devaluation. the bancorp does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update ltv ratios after origination. however, the bancorp monitors the local housing markets by reviewing various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring processes. for junior lien home equity loans which become 60 days or more past due, the bancorp tracks the performance of the senior lien loans in which the bancorp is the servicer and utilizes consumer credit bureau attributes to monitor the status of the senior lien loans that the bancorp does not service. if the senior lien loan is found to be 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status unless both loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. additionally, if the junior lien home equity loan becomes 120 days or more past due and the senior lien loan is also 120 days or more past due, the junior lien home equity loan is assessed for charge-off. refer to the analysis of nonperforming assets subsection of the risk management section of md&a for more information.

automobile portfolio the bancorps automobile portfolio balances have declined since december 31, 2017 as payoffs exceeded new loan production due to a strategic shift focusing on improving risk-adjusted returns. additionally, the concentration of lower fico (£690) origination balances remained within targeted credit risk tolerance during the year ended december 31, 2018. all concentration and guideline changes are monitored monthly to ensure alignment with original credit performance and return projections.

the automobile portfolio is characterized by direct and indirect lending products to consumers. as of december 31, 2018, 43% of the automobile loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by new automobiles. it is a common industry practice to advance on automobile loans an amount in excess of the automobile value due to the inclusion of negative equity trade-in, maintenance/warranty products, taxes, title and other fees paid at closing. the bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk loans.

other consumer portfolio loans the other consumer portfolio loans are comprised of secured and unsecured loans originated through the bancorps branch network as well as point-of-sale loans originated in connection with third-party financial technology companies. outstanding balances for other consumer loans increased approximately $783 million, or 50%, from december 31, 2017 primarily due to an increase in originations in connection with third-party financial technology companies. additionally, the bancorp has approximately $374
million in unfunded commitments associated with loans originated in connection with third-party financial technology companies as of december 31, 2018. fifth third closely monitors the credit performance of these point-of-sale loans which, for fifth third, is impacted by the credit loss protection coverage provided by the third-party financial technology companies.

analysis of nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured commercial and credit card loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; and certain other assets, including oreo and other repossessed property. a summary of nonperforming assets is included in table 51. for further information on the bancorps policies related to accounting for delinquent and nonperforming loans and leases, refer to the nonaccrual loans and leases section of note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
nonperforming assets were $411 million at december 31, 2018 compared to $495 million at december 31, 2017. at december 31, 2018, $16 million of nonaccrual loans were held for sale, compared to $6 million at december 31, 2017.
nonperforming portfolio assets as a percent of portfolio loans and leases and oreo were 0.41% as of december 31, 2018 compared to 0.53% as of december 31, 2017. nonaccrual loans and leases secured by real estate were 34% of nonaccrual loans and leases as of december
commercial portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $228 million at december 31, 2018, a decrease of $78 million from december 31, 2017. consumer portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases were $120 million at december 31, 2018, a decrease of $11 million from december 31, 2017. refer to table 52 for a rollforward of the portfolio nonaccrual loans and leases.
oreo and other repossessed property was $47 million at december 31, 2018, compared to $52 million at december 31, 2017. the bancorp recognized $7 million and $10 million in losses on the transfer, sale or write-down of oreo properties during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately $30 million and $36 million, respectively, of interest income would have been recognized if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with their original terms. although these values help demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest as nonaccrual loans and leases are generally carried below their principal balance.

troubled debt restructurings if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the bancorp may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to maximize collection of amounts due. typically, these modifications reduce the loan interest rate, extend the loan term, reduce the accrued interest or in limited circumstances, reduce the principal balance of the loan. these modifications are classified as tdrs.
at the time of modification, the bancorp maintains certain consumer loan tdrs (including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and other consumer loans) on accrual status, provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. commercial loans modified as part of a tdr are maintained on accrual status provided there is a sustained payment history of six months or greater prior to the modification in accordance with the modified terms and all remaining contractual payments under the modified terms are reasonably assured of collection. tdrs of commercial loans and credit card loans that do not have a sustained payment history of six months or greater in accordance with the modified terms remain on nonaccrual status until a six-month payment history is sustained.
consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $961 million and $927 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. as of december 31, 2018, the percentage of restructured residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and credit card loans that are past due 30 days or more were 25%, 11% and 39%, respectively.

analysis of net loan charge-offs net charge-offs were 35 bps and 32 bps of average portfolio loans and leases for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. table 55 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average portfolio loans and leases outstanding by loan category.
the ratio of commercial loan and lease net charge-offs to average portfolio commercial loans and leases was 23 bps during the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to 22 bps during the year ended december 31, 2017.
consumer loan net charge-offs as a percent of average portfolio consumer loans was 56 bps for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 49 bps for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to increases in net charge-offs on credit card of $17 million and increases in net charge-offs on other consumer loans of $12 million as a result of growth in unsecured loans.

charged-off as a percent of average portfolio loans and leases
(a) for the year ended december 31, 2018, the bancorp recorded $29 in both losses charged-off and recoveries of losses charged-off related to customer defaults on point-of-sale consumer loans for which the bancorp obtained recoveries under third-party credit enhancements.
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is comprised of the alll and the reserve for unfunded commitments. the alll provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. the bancorp evaluates the alll each quarter to determine its adequacy to cover inherent losses. several factors are taken into consideration in the determination of the overall alll, including an unallocated component. these factors include, but are not limited to, the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios, net charge-off experience, the extent of impaired loans and leases, the level of nonaccrual loans and leases, the level of 90 days past due loans and leases and the overall level of the alll as a percent of portfolio loans and leases. the bancorp also considers overall asset quality trends, credit administration and portfolio management practices, risk identification practices, credit policy and underwriting practices, overall portfolio growth, portfolio concentrations and current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio. refer to the critical accounting policies section of md&a for more information.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, the bancorp did not substantively change any material aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the alll and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance. in addition to the alll, the bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. the methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the bancorps methodology for determining the alll. the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments is included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
91  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the alll attributable to the portion of the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios that has not been restructured in a tdr is calculated on a pooled basis with the segmentation based on the similarity of credit risk characteristics. loss factors for consumer loans are developed for each pool based on the trailing twelve month historical loss rate, as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors. the prescriptive loss rate factors and qualitative adjustments are designed to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends which are not believed to be fully reflected in the trailing twelve month historical loss rate. for real estate backed consumer loans, the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends, ltv trends, refreshed fico score trends and product mix, and the qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and geographic concentrations. the bancorp considers home price index trends in its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor.
the bancorps determination of the alll for commercial loans is sensitive to the risk grades it assigns to these loans. in the event that 10% of commercial loans in each risk category would experience a downgrade of one risk category, the allowance for commercial loans would increase by approximately $163 million at december 31, 2018. in addition, the bancorps determination of the alll for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans and leases is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates. in the event that estimated loss rates would increase by 10%, the alll for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans and leases would increase by approximately $35 million at december 31, 2018. as several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered in determining the alll, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the alll. they are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and estimated loss rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. given current processes employed by the bancorp, management believes the risk grades and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate.

certain inherent but unconfirmed losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio. the bancorps current methodology for determining the level of losses is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and restructured loans and other qualitative adjustments. due to the heavy reliance on realized historical losses and the credit grade rating process, the model-derived estimate of alll tends to slightly lag behind the deterioration in the portfolio in a stable or deteriorating credit environment, and tends not to be as responsive when improved conditions have presented themselves. given these model limitations, the qualitative adjustment factors may be incremental or decremental to the quantitative model results.
an unallocated component of the alll is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss. the unallocated allowance as a percent of total portfolio loans and leases at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was 0.12% and 0.13%, respectively. the unallocated allowance was 10% of the total allowance at both december 31, 2018 and 2017.
as shown in table 57, the alll as a percent of portfolio loans and leases was 1.16% at december 31, 2018, compared to 1.30% at december 31, 2017. the alll was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

percent of portfolio loans and leases market risk management market risk is the day-to-day potential for the value of a financial instrument to increase or decrease due to movements in market factors. the bancorps market risk includes risks resulting from movements in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. interest rate risk, a component of market risk, primarily impacts the bancorps nii and interest sensitive fee income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income. management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons:
●   assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times;
●   short-term and long-term market interest rates change by different amounts; or
●   the expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change.
in addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on nii, interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand, credit losses, mortgage originations, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the bancorps earnings. stability of the bancorps net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. management continually reviews the bancorps balance sheet composition and earnings flows and models the interest rate risk, and possible actions to manage this risk, given numerous possible future interest rate scenarios. a series of policy limits and key risk indicators are employed to ensure that this risk is managed within the bancorps risk tolerance.
interest rate risk management oversight the bancorps alco, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ermc, monitors and manages interest rate risk within board-approved policy limits. in addition to the risk management activities of alco, the bancorp has a market risk management function as part of erm that provides independent oversight of market risk activities.
net interest income sensitivity the bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an nii simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of nii to changes in interest rates. the model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the bancorps assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities. the model also includes senior managements projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, deviations from projected assumptions, as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies.
93  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december 31, 2018, the bancorps interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in nii over 12-month and 24-month horizons assuming a 200 bps parallel ramped increase and a 150 bps parallel ramped decrease in interest rates. additionally, the bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios, including ramps, shocks and twists to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve.
in order to recognize the risk of noninterest-bearing demand deposit balance run-off in a rising interest rate environment, the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately $500 million of additional demand deposit balances run-off over 24 months above what is included in senior managements baseline projections for each 100 bps increase in short-term market interest rates. similarly, the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately $500 million of incremental growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances over 24 months above senior managements baseline projections for each 100 bps decrease in short-term market interest rates. the incremental balance run-off and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with market rate changes.
another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interest-bearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease. this deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta, and it represents the expected amount by which bancorp deposit rates will change for a given change in short-term market rates. the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes a weighted-average rising rate interest-bearing deposit beta of 70% at december 31, 2018, which is approximately 10 to 20 percentage points higher than the average beta that the bancorp experienced in the last frb tightening cycle from june 2004 to june 2006 and higher than the most recent beta experienced in the current tightening cycle to date. the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes a weighted-average falling rate interest-bearing deposit beta of 40% at december 31, 2018. in addition, the modeling assumes there is no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred for each rate move thus far in the current tightening cycle.
the bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions. the bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions, such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixed-rate customer liabilities.

month horizon. additionally, $3.2 billion in out of the money cash flow hedges, originally maturing in 2019, were terminated to enhance asset sensitivity over the next year and to increase the capacity for additional cash flow hedges, as warranted. the changes in the estimated nii sensitivity profile as of december 31, 2018 compared to december 31, 2017 were primarily attributable to an increase in the outstanding taxable securities balances, a net increase in outstanding receive-fixed swaps against floating-rate commercial loans, the addition of forward starting floors against one-month libor, reduced noninterest-bearing deposit balances and a decrease in outstanding fixed-rate long-term debt. these items were partially offset by an overall increase in core deposit balances and a reduction in fixed-rate commercial leases and residential mortgage.

economic value of equity sensitivity the bancorp also uses eve as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. whereas the nii sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted nii on an fte basis (non-gaap) over one and two year time horizons, eve is a point-in-time analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives. the eve of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows. due to this longer horizon, the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. eve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the balance growth assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis. as with the nii simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the eve analysis. particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of transaction deposits.
the following table shows the bancorps estimated eve sensitivity profile as of december 31:
table 61: estimated eve sensitivity profile
change in interest rates (bps)        change in eve                  alco policy limit               change in eve               alco policy limit
-200 shock                                      (5.27     )                    (12.00)                         n/a                             n/a the eve sensitivity is moderately negative in both the +200 bps rising rate and the -200 bps falling rate scenarios at december 31, 2018. the changes in the estimated eve sensitivity profile from december 31, 2017 are primarily related to an increase in the outstanding taxable securities balance, migration from noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing deposits with higher attrition assumptions, the addition of receive-fixed swaps against floating-rate commercial loans and the addition of interest rate floors. these items were partially offset by net run-off of the fixed-rate commercial lease and residential mortgage portfolios and overall deposit growth.
while an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). further, eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates. the nii simulations and eve analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates.
the bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast, libor, prime rate and other basis risks, yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks.
95  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition, the impacts on nii on an fte basis and eve of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled, wherein the bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios.
use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of the bancorps interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. examples of derivative instruments that the bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, forward starting interest rate swaps, options, swaptions and tba securities.
as part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its residential mortgage banking activities, the bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge irlcs that are also considered free-standing derivatives. additionally, the bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options.
the bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers.
generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the bancorp from market volatility. credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. the bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. these controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management. for further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives, refer to note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
portfolio loans and leases and interest rate risk although the bancorps portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable-rate products, the rates of interest earned by the bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. the interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established.

residential mortgage servicing rights and interest rate risk the fair value of the residential msr portfolio was $938 million and $858 million at december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017, respectively. the value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans.
96  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its msr portfolio as a result of changing interest rates.
mortgage rates increased during the year ended december 31, 2018 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to slow. the fair value of the msr portfolio increased $42 million due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and oas spread assumptions and decreased $125 million due to the passage of time, including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments, paydowns and payoffs for the year ended december 31, 2018.
mortgage rates decreased during the year ended december 31, 2017 which caused modeled prepayment speeds to increase, leading to fair value adjustments on servicing rights. the fair value of the msr portfolio decreased $1 million due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and oas spread assumptions and decreased $121 million due to the passage of time, including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments, paydowns and payoffs for the year ended december 31, 2017.
the bancorp recognized net losses of $36 million and net gains of $4 million, respectively, on its non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. these amounts include net losses of $15 million and net gains of $2 million, respectively, on securities related to the bancorps non-qualifying hedging strategy during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. the bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its msr portfolio, the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment. refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on msrs.
foreign currency risk the bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. the derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. the balance of the bancorps foreign denominated loans at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $948 million and $939 million, respectively. the bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. similar to the hedging of interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity. the bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. these controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management.
commodity risk the bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations. similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts, the bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity. the bancorp may also offset this risk with exchange-traded commodity contracts. the bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers. these controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management.
liquidity risk management the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. a summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
the bancorps treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on point-in-time metrics as well as forward-looking projections, which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios. liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the treasury department, and a series of policy limits and key risk indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the bancorps risk tolerance. the bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing, which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions, time horizons, asset growth rates and other events. the contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. the contingency plan also outlines the bancorps response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios.
liquidity risk management oversight the bancorps alco, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ermc, monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within board-approved policy limits. in addition to the risk management activities of alco, the bancorp has a market risk management function as part of erm that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management.
sources of funds the bancorps primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings.
table 62 of the market risk management subsection of the risk management section of md&a illustrates the expected maturities from loan and lease repayments. of the $32.8 billion of securities in the bancorps available-for-sale debt and other securities portfolio at december 31, 2018, $3.3 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $3.2 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. for further information on the bancorps securities portfolio, refer to the investment securities subsection of the balance sheet analysis section of md&a.
97  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset-driven liquidity is provided by the bancorps ability to sell or securitize loans and leases. in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. a majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to fhlmc or fnma guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans, certain commercial loans, home equity loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. the bancorp sold or securitized loans totaling $5.5 billion during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to $7.5 billion during the year ended december 31, 2017. for further information, refer to note 10 and note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
core deposits have historically provided the bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. the bancorps average core deposits and average shareholders equity funded 83% of its average total assets for both the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. in addition to core deposit funding, the bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the fhlb system. certificates $100,000 and over and deposits in the bancorps foreign branch located in the cayman islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs.
as of december 31, 2018, $7.3 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance under the current bancorps board of directors authorizations and the bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the sec to permit ready access to the public securities markets; however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. during the year ended 2018, the bancorp issued and sold $900 million of senior notes.
the banks global bank note program has a borrowing capacity of $25.0 billion, of which $17.0 billion was available for issuance as of december 31, 2018. during the year ended 2018, the bank issued and sold $1.6 billion of senior bank notes. additionally, at december 31, 2018, the bank had approximately $45.2 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources including the fhlb and frb.
for further information on subsequent events related to long-term debt, refer to note 31 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio the bancorp is subject to the modified lcr requirement, which stipulates that bhcs with at least $50 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets that are not internationally active, such as the bancorp, maintain hqla equal to their calculated net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress period multiplied by a factor of 0.7. the bancorps modified lcr was 128% at december 31, 2018.
further, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2018, bhcs subject to the modified lcr are required to calculate and disclose the quarterly average components used to calculate their modified lcr.
the following table presents the components of the bancorps quarterly average modified lcr for the three months ended:

on june 1, 2016, the u.s. banking agencies published a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement a modified nsfr for certain bank holding companies with at least $50 billion but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and with less than $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposures, including the bancorp. generally consistent with the bcbs framework, under the proposed rule banking organizations would be required to hold an amount of asf over a one-year time horizon that equals or exceeds the institutions amount of rsf, with the asf representing the numerator and the rsf representing the denominator of the nsfr. banking organizations subject to the modified nsfr would multiply the rsf amount by 70%, such that the rsf amount required for these institutions would be equivalent to 70% of the rsf amount that would be required pursuant to the full nsfr generally applicable to institutions with at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposures under the proposed rule. the comment period for this proposal ended on august 5, 2016.
on october 31, 2018, the board of governors of the frb released a series of regulatory proposals to implement the economic growth, regulatory relief, and consumer protection act (reform act). among the proposals, the board of governors, joined by the department of treasury, office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation proposed to remove the application of the lcr regulations and the nsfr from certain bhcs that qualify under the proposal as category iv
institutions, primarily those bhcs with consolidated assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, including fifth third bancorp.
the nprs public comment period ended january 22, 2019 and could be further amended by the frb and other financial regulators prior to adoption. as such, the ultimate impacts of the npr to fifth third bancorp, fifth third bank and their respective subsidiaries and activities will be subject to the final form of these nprs and additional rulemakings issued. fifth third cannot predict future changes in the applicable laws, regulations and regulatory agency policies, yet such changes may have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.
credit ratings the cost and availability of financing to the bancorp and bank are impacted by its credit ratings. a downgrade to the bancorps or banks credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the bancorps or banks financial condition and liquidity. key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.
the bancorps and banks credit ratings are summarized in table 65. the ratings reflect the ratings agencys view on the bancorps and banks capacity to meet financial commitments.*

to control, monitor and govern operational risk, the bancorp maintains an overall risk management framework which comprises governance oversight, risk assessment, capital measurement, monitoring and reporting as well as a formal three lines of defense approach. erm is responsible for prescribing the framework to the lines of business and corporate functions and providing independent oversight of its implementation (second line of defense). business controls groups are in place in each of the lines of business to ensure consistent implementation and execution of managing day-to-day operational risk (first line of defense).
the bancorps risk management framework consists of five integrated components, including identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and independent governance reporting of risk. the corporate operational risk management function within enterprise risk is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of the bancorps approach to managing operational risk. this includes providing governance, awareness and training, tools, guidance and oversight to support implementation of key risk programs and systems as they relate to operational risk management, such as risk and control self-assessments, new product/initiative risk reviews, key risk indicators, vendor risk management, cyber security risk management and review of operational losses. the function is also responsible for developing reports that support the proactive management of operational risk across the enterprise. the lines of business and corporate functions are responsible for managing the operational risks associated with their areas in accordance with the risk management framework. the framework is intended to enable the bancorp to function with a sound and well-controlled operational environment. these processes support the bancorps goals to minimize future operational losses and strengthen the bancorps performance by maintaining sufficient capital to absorb operational losses that are incurred.
the bancorp also maintains a robust information security program to support the management of cyber security risk within the organization with a focus on prevention, detection and recovery processes. fifth third utilizes a wide array of techniques to secure its operations and proprietary information such as board-approved policies and programs, network monitoring and testing, access controls and dedicated security personnel. fifth third has adopted the national institute of standards and technology cyber security framework for the management and deployment of cyber security controls and is an active participant in the financial sector information sharing organization structure, known as the financial services information sharing and analysis center. to ensure resiliency of key bancorp functions, fifth third also employs redundancy protocols that include a robust business continuity function that works to mitigate any potential impacts to fifth third customers and its systems.
fifth third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of operational control issues to senior management and the board of directors. the operational risk committee is the key committee that oversees and supports fifth third in the management of operational risk across the enterprise. the operational risk committee reports to the ermc, which reports to the risk and compliance joint committee of the board of directors of fifth third bancorp and fifth third bank.
compliance risk management regulatory compliance risk is defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss or damage to reputation as a result of noncompliance with (i) applicable laws, regulations, rules and other regulatory requirements (including but not limited to the risk of consumers experiencing economic loss or other legal harm as a result of noncompliance with consumer protection laws, regulations and requirements); (ii) internal policies and procedures, standards of best practice or codes of conduct; and (iii) principles of integrity and fair dealing applicable to fifth thirds activities and functions. fifth third focuses on managing regulatory compliance risk in accordance with the bancorps integrated risk management framework, which ensures consistent processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. the bancorps risk management goal is to keep compliance risk at appropriate levels consistent with the bancorps risk appetite.
99  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to mitigate compliance risk, compliance risk management provides independent oversight to ensure consistency and sufficiency in the execution of the program, and ensures that lines of business, regions and support functions are adequately identifying, assessing and monitoring compliance risks and adopting proper mitigation strategies. the lines of business and enterprise functions are responsible for managing the compliance risks associated with their areas. additionally, the chief compliance officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing the compliance risk management program which implements key compliance processes, including but not limited to, executive- and board-level governance and reporting routines, compliance-related policies, risk assessments, key risk indicators, issues tracking, regulatory compliance testing and monitoring, anti-money laundering, privacy and, in partnership with the community and economic development team, oversees the bancorps compliance with the community reinvestment act.
fifth third also focuses on the reporting and escalation of compliance issues to senior management and the board of directors. the management compliance committee, which is chaired by the chief compliance officer, is the key committee that oversees and supports fifth third in the management of compliance risk across the enterprise. the management compliance committee oversees fifth third-wide compliance issues, industry best practices, legislative developments, regulatory concerns and other leading indicators of compliance risk. the management compliance committee reports to the ermc, which reports to the risk and compliance joint committee of the board of directors of fifth third bancorp and fifth third bank.
capital management management regularly reviews the bancorps capital levels to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments. the bancorp has established a capital committee which is responsible for making capital plan recommendations to management. these recommendations are reviewed by the ermc and the annual capital plan is approved by the board of directors.
the capital committee is responsible for execution and oversight of the capital actions of the capital plan.
regulatory capital ratios the basel iii final rule was effective for the bancorp on january 1, 2015 and set minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as defined the measure of well-capitalized.

on january 1, 2016, the bancorp became subject to a capital conservation buffer which will be phased in over a three-year period ending january 1, 2019. once fully phased-in, the capital conservation buffer will be 2.5% in addition to the minimum capital ratios, in order to avoid limitations on certain capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. the capital conservation buffer was 0.625% in 2016, 1.25% in 2017, and is 1.875% in 2018. the bancorp exceeded these well-capitalized and capital conservation buffer ratios for all periods presented.
in april 2018, the federal banking regulators proposed transitional arrangements to permit banking organizations to phase in the day-one impact of the adoption of asu 2016-13, referred to as the current expected credit loss model, on regulatory capital over a period of three years. for additional information on asu 2016-13, refer to note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. the bancorp is evaluating the impact of this proposal.
the bancorp made a one-time permanent election to not include aoci in regulatory capital in the march 31, 2015 ffiec 031 and fr y-9c filings.

stress tests and ccar in 2011 the frb adopted the capital plan rule, which requires bhcs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans to the frb for review. under the rule, these capital plans must include detailed descriptions of the following: the bhcs internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; the policies governing capital actions such as common stock issuances, dividends and share repurchases; and all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon. further, each bhc must also report to the frb the results of stress tests conducted by the bhc under a number of scenarios that assess the sources and uses of capital under baseline and stressed economic scenarios. the frb launched the 2018 stress testing program and ccar on february 1, 2018, with submissions of stress test results and capital plans to the frb due on april 5, 2018, which the bancorp submitted as required.
as a ccar institution, the bancorp is required to disclose the results of its company-run stress test under the supervisory adverse and supervisory severely adverse scenarios and to provide information related to the types of risk included in its stress testing, a general description of the methodologies used, estimates of certain financial results and pro forma capital ratios, and an explanation of the most significant causes of changes in regulatory capital ratios. on june 21, 2018 the bancorp publicly disclosed the results of its company-run stress test as required by the dfa stress testing rules, which is available on fifth thirds website at www.53.com. with fifth thirds designation as a large and non-complex bank, it is no longer subject to the qualitative aspects of the ccar program. it is, however, subject to the frbs horizontal capital review, which was conducted in the third quarter of 2018. refer to note 3 and note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on the frbs review of the capital plan, the frbs non-objection to the bancorps proposed capital actions and the bancorps capital actions taken in 2018.
on may 21, 2018, the bancorp announced the planned acquisition of mb financial, inc. as a result of this transaction, the frb required the bancorp to resubmit its ccar plan recognizing the pro forma impact of the combined fifth third/mb financial, inc. post-merger entity. on october 5, 2018, fifth third resubmitted its capital plan to the frb. on december 27, 2018, the frb indicated to the bancorp that it did not object to the resubmitted capital plan. the resubmitted capital plan called for no change to the originally submitted total capital actions over the 2018 ccar approval horizon (the third quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019). however, the share repurchase authority increased from $1.651 billion to $1.81 billion as a result of after-tax gains related to the sale of worldpay, inc. common stock.
in april 2018, the frb proposed to introduce stress buffer requirements. under the proposal, a scb would replace the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. the scb would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the frbs ccar stress tests plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject to a floor of 2.5%. the proposal would also introduce a slb requirement, analogous to the scb, that would apply to the tier i leverage ratio. in addition, the proposal would require bhcs to reduce their planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bhcs own baseline scenario projections. the proposal is applicable for bhcs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including the bancorp. under the proposal, a bhcs first scb and slb requirements would become effective on october 1, 2019. the bancorp is evaluating the impact of this proposal.
dividend policy and stock repurchase program the bancorps common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory requirements and expectations. the bancorp declared dividends per common share of $0.74 and $0.60 during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the bancorp entered into or settled a number of accelerated share repurchase and open market share repurchase transactions during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. refer to note 22 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the accelerated share repurchases and open market share repurchase transactions.

102  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, the bancorp enters into financial transactions that are considered off-balance sheet arrangements as they involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the bancorps consolidated balance sheets. the bancorps off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments, guarantees, contingent liabilities and transactions with non-consolidated vies. a brief discussion of these transactions is as follows:
commitments the bancorp has certain commitments to make future payments under contracts, including commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, forward contracts related to residential mortgage loans held for sale, noncancelable operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, capital expenditures, capital commitments for private equity investments and capital lease obligations. refer to note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on commitments.
guarantees and contingent liabilities the bancorp has performance obligations upon the occurrence of certain events provided in certain contractual arrangements, including residential mortgage loans sold with representation and warranty provisions or credit recourse. refer to note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on guarantees and contingent liabilities.
transactions with non-consolidated vies the bancorp engages in a variety of activities that involve vies, which are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities, or the equity investors of the entities as a group lack any of the characteristics of a controlling interest. the investments in those entities in which the bancorp was determined not to be the primary beneficiary but holds a variable interest in the entity are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or other accounting standards as appropriate and not consolidated. refer to note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on non-consolidated vies.
103  fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations and other commitments the bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts. the aggregate contractual obligations and commitments at december 31, 2018 are shown in table 69. as of december 31, 2018, the bancorp has unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods. due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, all uncertain tax liabilities that have not been paid have been excluded from the following table. for further detail on the impact of income taxes, refer to note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.

item 1a.  risk factors risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results risks related to our business failure to introduce successful new solutions and services in a timely manner to address increased competition, rapid technological changes, and changing industry standards could result in our solutions and services becoming obsolete.
we generally sell our solutions in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new solution and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. in addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. without the timely introduction of new solutions, services and enhancements, our solutions and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. our ability to offer new solutions and services and to deploy them in a timely manner depend on several factors, including but not limited to our ability to:
•   properly identify customer needs;
•   innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;
•   successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;
•   differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;
•   price our solutions competitively;
•   anticipate our competitors' development of new solutions, services or technological innovations; and
•   control product quality in our manufacturing process.
our future operating results may fluctuate significantly if our investments in innovative technologies are not as profitable as we anticipate.
on a regular basis, we review the existing technologies available in the market and identify strategic new technologies to develop and invest in. we are currently devoting significant resources to the 5g technology, in the automotive and battery industries, in the internet of things, and mobile industries. we are investing in r&d, developing relationships with customers and suppliers, and re-directing our corporate and operational resources to grow within these innovative technologies. our income could be harmed if we fail to gain sufficient market share, if demand for our solutions is lower than we expect, or if our income related to the innovative technologies is lower than we anticipate. for example, when the 5g standards are published, we may not be able to produce a satisfactory return on investment if our strategic vision and the resources that we are spending on developing our presence in the 5g technology industry turn out to be misaligned with such standards.
failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.
our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. the sale of our solutions and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. for example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. during a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. in the past, we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products. in addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to re-engineer our solution. in addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. in order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancellable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for electronic products has decreased. if demand for our solutions is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.
economic and political policies favoring national interests could adversely affect our results of operations.
our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and international economic and political conditions. many of our suppliers, vendors, partners, and other entities with whom we do business have strong ties to doing business in china and their ability to supply materials to us or otherwise work with us is strongly affected by their ability to do business in china. if the u.s.'s relationship with china deteriorates or results in trade protection measures, retaliatory actions, tariffs and increased barriers,
policies that favor domestic industries, or increased import or export licensing requirements or restrictions, then our operations may be adversely affected due to such changes in the economic and political ecosystem in which our suppliers, vendors, partners, and other entities with whom we do business operate.
we have significant operations, including a large number of employees, manufacturing facilities, and operations centers in the united states, the united kingdom, the european union, singapore, malaysia and china among other countries. nationalistic economic policies and political trends in these territories, such as opposition to globalization and free trade, sanctions or trade restrictions, withdrawal from or re-negotiation of global trade agreements, tax policies that favor domestic industries and interests, the anticipated exit of the united kingdom from the european union (known as brexit), the distancing or potential exit of other countries from the european union, and other similar actions may result in increased transaction costs, reduced ability to hire employees, reduced access to supplies and materials, reduced demand or access to customers in international markets, and inability to conduct our operations as they have been conducted historically. each of these factors may adversely affect our business.
economic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
because we sell our solutions worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. however, there can be no assurances that our international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with our effort to increase foreign market penetration. in addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states. accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
•   changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions, including but not limited to changes that favor national interests and economic volatility;
•   negative consequences from changes in tax laws;
•   interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
•   difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;
•   local competition;
•   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
•   inadequate local infrastructure;
•   potential incidences of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and
•   volatile geopolitical turmoil, including popular uprisings, regional conflicts, terrorism, and war.
we centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations: india and malaysia. these processes include general accounting, inventory cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivables functions. if conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers. our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.
further, even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage similar risks.
our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our solutions decline or do not grow as anticipated.
visibility into our markets is limited. our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technology-related spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. in addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. however, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. any decline in our customers' markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our solutions and services. the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our business. also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. such declines could harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, r&d and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough, these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.
uncertainty in general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the united states. global and regional economic uncertainty or depression may impact our business, resulting in:
•   reduced demand for our solutions, delays in the shipment of orders or increases in order cancellations;
•   increased price pressure for our solutions and services; and
•   greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our future investment portfolio.
in addition, global and regional macroeconomic developments, such as increased unemployment, decreased income, reduced access to credit, volatility in capital markets, decreased liquidity, uncertain or destabilizing national election results in the u.s., europe, and asia, and negative changes or volatility in general economic conditions in the u.s., europe, and asia could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in those territories. financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers and customers, including distributors, due to economic volatility or negative changes could result in product delays and inventory issues. economic risks related to accounts receivable could result in delays in collection and greater bad debt expense.
dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring solutions to market and damage our reputation. dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.
as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring solutions to market and our reputation could suffer. for example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcees could cause disruptions or delays. in addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology ("it") and other administrative functions. since it is critical to our operations, any failure of our it providers to perform could impair our ability to operate effectively. in addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies, and could impact our results of operations and stock price. much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.
our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our solutions.
because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. during a general market upturn or an upturn in our business, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner, which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income, margin and operating results. by contrast, if, during an economic downturn, we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income, margins and operating results.
key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
certain key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions. large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities for us if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times. while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts, we may have to agree to some or all of these types of provisions to secure these orders and to continue to grow our business. such actions expose us to significant additional risks, which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
industry consolidation and consolidation among our customer base may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.
there is potential for industry consolidation in our markets. as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry, companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations. companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors and could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. furthermore, particularly in the communications market, rapid consolidation would lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.
additionally, if there is consolidation among our customer base, our customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale, which could adversely affect our profitability. in addition, if, as a result of increased leverage, customer pressures require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are diminished, we could decide not to sell our solutions under such less favorable terms, which would decrease our revenue. consolidation among our customer base may also lead to reduced demand for our solutions, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors and cancellations of orders, each of which could harm our operating results.
our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.
in the normal course of business, we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures. as a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. further, such transactions often have post-closing arrangements, including, but not limited to, post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. in addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. we may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
•   the achievement of anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the acquired company;
•   the compatibility of our infrastructure, operations, policies and organizations with those of the acquired company;
•   the retention of key employees and/or customers;
•   the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas; and
•   the management of relationships with our strategic partners, suppliers, and customer base.
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted. additionally, we may record significant goodwill and other assets as a result of acquisitions or investments, and we may be required to incur impairment charges, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
any inability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms could negatively impact our growth rate and financial performance.
our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and business performance. appropriate targets for acquisition are difficult to identify and complete for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to, limited due diligence, high valuations, business and intellectual property evaluations, other interested parties, negotiations of the definitive documentation, satisfaction of closing conditions, the need to obtain antitrust or other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms, and availability of funding. the inability to close appropriate acquisitions on acceptable terms could adversely impact our growth rate, revenue, and financial performance.
we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing shareholders.
we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes. for example, we may need to increase our investment in r&d activities or need funds to make acquisitions. we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance solutions or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. if we finance acquisitions by issuing additional convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience share dilution, which could affect the market price of our stock. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. if we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants.
we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
we currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility. we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.
our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry.
our current revolving credit facility and term loan imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. in addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.
if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, our financial results could be adversely affected.
a substantial amount of our solutions are priced and paid for in u.s. dollars, although many of our solutions are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. our hedging programs are designed to reduce, but not entirely eliminate, within any given 12-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, including those caused by currency controls, which could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. however, for expenses beyond a 12-month period, our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk. in addition, our currency hedging programs involve third-party financial institutions as counterparties. the weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in the number of available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling solutions or services.
third parties may claim that one or more of our solutions or services infringe their intellectual property rights. we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case-by-case basis. any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations. a claim of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement (which may not be available under acceptable terms, or at all), require us to redesign certain of our solutions (which would be costly and time-consuming) and/or subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development and sale of certain solutions or services. in certain of our businesses, we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses, and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all.
third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights.
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. we rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer, which could harm our operating results.
our pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. in addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage. in preparation for the separation and distribution, we have applied for trademarks related to our new global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide. any successful opposition to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand. different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights.
we may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights, and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties. our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner, or at all. in some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons. in addition, competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and
could result in lost revenues to the company. furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others, which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property.
if we experience a significant cybersecurity attack or disruption in our it systems, our business, reputation, and operating results could be adversely affected.
we rely on several centralized it systems to provide solutions and services, maintain financial records, retain sensitive data such as intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to customers, suppliers, and business partners, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals.
despite our implementation of network security measures, our network may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. our network security measures include, but are not limited to, the implementation of firewalls, antivirus protection, patches, log monitors, routine backups, offsite storage, network audits, and routine updates and modifications. despite our efforts to create these security barriers, we may not be able to keep pace as new threats emerge and it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition, and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such attacks will be successful.
in addition, our it systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. such events could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime, along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to our customers, suppliers and business partners. to the extent that such disruptions occur, our customers and partners may lose confidence in our solutions and we may lose business or brand reputation, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition.
we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. the outcomes of these tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued.
our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in our business mix or changes in the tax legislative landscape.
our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because, among other things, there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. changes in tax laws, such as tax reform in the united states or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic co-operation and development's ("oecd") multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address "base erosion and profit shifting" and the taxation of the "digital economy" could impact our effective tax rate.
if tax laws or incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.
we are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. we devote significant resources to evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. our financial results and tax treatment are susceptible to changes in tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, principles, and interpretations in the united states and in other jurisdictions where we do business. with the rise of economic and political policies that favor domestic interests, it is possible that more countries will enact tax laws that either increase the tax rates, or reduce or change the tax incentives available to multinational companies like ours. upon a change in tax laws in any territory where we do significant business, such as the u.s., the european union, or singapore, we may not be able to maintain our current tax rate or qualify for or maintain the benefits of any tax incentives offered, to the extent such incentives are offered.
we currently benefit from tax incentives extended to certain of our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment, the most significant of which being singapore. the singapore tax incentives require that specific conditions be satisfied, which
include achieving thresholds of employment, ownership of certain assets, as well as specific types of investment activities within singapore. based on the current tax environment, we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future as needed, but cannot guarantee that the tax environment will not change or that such conditions will be satisfied.
our singapore tax incentives are due for renewal in fiscal 2024, but we cannot guarantee that singapore will not revoke the tax incentives earlier. our taxes could increase if the existing singapore incentives are not renewed upon revocation or expiration. we cannot guarantee that we will qualify for any new incentive regime that may exist in fiscal 2024, or that such conditions will be satisfied. if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentives conditions, we may lose the related tax incentives and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided. as a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives and could harm our operating results.
our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel, including personnel joining our company through acquisitions. the markets in which we operate are dynamic, and we may need to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures from time to time. we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate. however, there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas in which we operate, and it may become more difficult to retain key employees. if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we may not be able to meet key objectives, such as launching effective product innovations and meeting financial goals, and maintain or expand our business.
if we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event, our operations could be significantly harmed.
our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. in particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations. for example, our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. if such a disruption were to occur, we could breach our agreements, our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. in addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decision with respect to risk retention. economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. if our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.
if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be subject to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties.
we and our customers are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including, but not limited to, health and safety, packaging, data privacy, product content, labor and import/export regulations. these regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, high financial penalties, product recalls or impositions of fines, and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. if demand for our solutions is adversely affected or our costs increase, our business would suffer.
in response to changes in data privacy regulations, such as the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") in the european union, which became effective on may 25, 2018, we are modifying our data handling practices and devoting resources to keeping up with the changing regulatory environment on data privacy in the jurisdictions where we do business. new laws, amendments, or interpretations of regulations, industry standards, and contractual obligations relating to privacy or data may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. if we fail to comply with gdpr or other data privacy regulation, we may be subject to significant financial fines and civil or criminal penalties, and may suffer high damage to our reputation or brand, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
in addition, our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the international standards organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the u.s. federal communications commission. we also must comply with work safety rules. if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.
failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could adversely affect our business and result in financial penalties.
because we have extensive international operations, we must comply with complex foreign and u.s. laws and regulations, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. although we actively maintain policies and procedures designed to ensure ongoing compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our solutions in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results.
our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings.
we are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. the outcome of existing proceedings, lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict. various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.
our internal controls may be determined to be ineffective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company, the value of our stock, and our access to capital.
the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, among other things. we are devoting significant resources and time to comply with such internal control over financial reporting requirements. however, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock or on our access to capital, or cause us to be subject to investigation or sanctions by the sec.
adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.
our cash and cash equivalents are invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition.
future investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans.
we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees. the federal pension protection act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the u.s. plans, and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the united states. because it is unknown what the investment return on and the fair value of our pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates and discount rates may be at any point in time, no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition.
environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved, and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.
some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hp inc. ("hp") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilent's separation from hp in 1999. in connection with agilent's separation from hp, hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. agilent has assigned its rights and obligations
under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation. as a result, hp will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation. although hp agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at such properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. in connection with the separation, agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto. we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations.
in connection with the separation from agilent, agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to keysight. we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations.
our current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. as a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states, even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.
our common stock is listed on nyse under the ticker symbol "keys." the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including but not limited to:
•   actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;
•   success or failure of our business strategy;
•   our ability to obtain third-party financing as needed;
•   announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;
•   changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;
•   the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;
•   changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;
•   the operating and share price performance of other comparable companies;
•   overall market fluctuations;
•   results from any material litigation or government investigations;
•   changes in laws or regulations affecting our business; and
•   general economic conditions and other external factors.
stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
in addition, when the market price of a company's shares drops significantly, shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources.
we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock. the payment of any dividends in the future, and the timing and amount thereof, to our stockholders fall within the discretion of our board of directors. the board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, restrictive covenants in our debt, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. we cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends.
certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. these provisions include but are not limited to:
•   the inability of our shareholders to call a special meeting;
•   the inability of our shareholders to act without a meeting of shareholders;
•   rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;
•   the right of our board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;
•   the division of our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term, and this classified board provision could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult;
•   a provision that shareholders may only remove directors with cause;
•   the ability of our directors, and not shareholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors; and
•   the requirement that the affirmative vote of shareholders holding at least 80 percent of our voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (relating to the number, term and removal of our directors, the filling of our board vacancies, the advance notice to be given for nominations for elections of directors, the calling of special meetings of shareholders, shareholder action by written consent, the ability of the board of directors to amend the bylaws, elimination of liability of directors to the extent permitted by delaware law, exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders and amendments of the certificate of incorporation) and certain provisions in our amended and restated bylaws (relating to the calling of special meetings of shareholders, the business that may be conducted or considered at annual or special meetings, the advance notice of shareholder business and nominations, shareholder action by written consent, the number, tenure, qualifications and removal of our directors, the filling of our board vacancies, director and officer indemnification and amendments of the bylaws).
in addition, because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl"), this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor. section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation (an "interested stockholder") shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder, unless (i) prior to such time, the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85 percent of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced (excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan); or (iii) on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder.
we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. however, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders. these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the state of delaware or, if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the district of delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless the board of directors otherwise determines, the state courts in the state of delaware or, if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the district of delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to the company or our shareholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or keysight's
amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.
risks related to the acquisition of ixia we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of ixia or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating the two businesses.
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of ixia (the "merger") will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate our and ixia's businesses. the combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. as a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating ixia's business practices and operations with our existing business practices and operations. the integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market conditions or other factors, we may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the merger. our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the two businesses to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations.
in addition, the overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management's attention. the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include but are not limited to:
•   the diversion of management's attention to integration matters;
•   difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining ixia's business with our business;
•   difficulties entering new markets or manufacturing in new geographies where we have no or limited direct prior experience;
•   difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;
•   successfully managing relationships with our strategic partners and supplier and customer base; and
•   challenges in maintaining existing, and establishing new, business relationships.
many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact the business, financial condition and our results of operations. in addition, even if the operations of our business and ixia's business are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the merger, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. furthermore, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses. additionally, we may record significant goodwill and other assets as a result of acquisitions or investments, and we may be required to incur impairment charges, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. all of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and negatively impact us. as a result, we cannot be certain that the combination of our and ixia's businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the merger.
risks related to the spin-off from agilent we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of agilent.
after our spin-off from agilent on november 1, 2014, there are several significant areas where the liabilities of agilent may become our obligations. for example, under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the agilent u.s. consolidated group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is severally liable for the u.s. federal income tax liability of the entire agilent u.s. consolidated group for that taxable period. consequently, if agilent is unable to pay the consolidated u.s. federal income tax liability for a prior period, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such tax, which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to it as agreed between us and agilent at the time of separation. other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.
there could be significant liability if the distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction.
a condition to the spin-off is that agilent received an opinion of baker & mckenzie llp, tax counsel to agilent, regarding the qualification of the separation and the distribution as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(d) of the code. the opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from agilent and keysight, including
those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, agilent and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the opinion, and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion.
if the distribution were determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, agilent and its shareholders that are subject to u.s. federal income tax could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities. for example, if the distribution failed to qualify for tax-free treatment, agilent would for u.s. federal income tax purposes be treated as if it had sold the keysight common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and agilent's shareholders, who are subject to u.s. federal income tax, would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the keysight common stock received in the distribution. in addition, if the separation and distribution failed to qualify for tax-free treatment under federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, agilent and keysight could each incur significant tax liabilities under u.s. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law.
under the agreement between agilent and keysight pertaining to tax matters, as finalized at the time of separation, we are generally required to indemnify agilent against taxes incurred by agilent that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take, as the case may be, certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a tax-free distribution under section 355 of the code. under the agreement between agilent and keysight, as finalized at the time of separation, we may also be required to indemnify agilent for other contingent tax liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.

overview and executive summary keysight technologies, inc. ("we," "us," "keysight" or the "company"), incorporated in delaware on december 6, 2013, is a technology company providing electronic design and test solutions that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment, validation, optimization and secure operation of electronics systems to communications, networking and electronics industries. we also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle, including start-up assistance, instrument productivity, application services and instrument calibration and repair.
we invest in product development to address the changing needs of the market and facilitate growth. we are investing in research and development to design measurement solutions that will satisfy the changing needs of our customers. these opportunities are being driven by evolving technology standards and the need for faster data rates and new form factors.
on april 18, 2017, we completed the acquisition of ixia, which became a separate reportable operating segment, the ixia solutions group. as a result, keysight has four segments: communications solutions group, electronic industrial solutions group, ixia solutions group and services solutions group. the communications solutions group provides electronic design and test software, instruments, and systems spanning the worldwide commercial communications and aerospace, defense and government end markets. the electronic industrial solutions group provides test and measurement solutions across a broad set of electronic industrial end markets. the ixia solutions group provides testing, visibility and security solutions, strengthening applications across physical and virtual networks for enterprises, service providers and network equipment manufacturers. the services solutions group provides repair, calibration and consulting services, and resells used keysight equipment. also, our global team of experts provides startup assistance, consulting, optimization and application support across all our end markets.
keysight's total orders in 2018 were $4,082 million, an increase of 20 percent when compared to 2017. foreign currency movements had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year-over-year comparison. orders associated with acquisitions accounted for 7 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31, 2018 when compared to 2017. total orders in 2017 were $3,406 million, an increase of 15 percent when compared to 2016. foreign currency movements had a negligible impact on the year-over-year comparison. orders associated with acquisitions accounted for 9 percentage points of order growth for the year ended october 31, 2017 when compared to 2016.
net revenue of $3,878 million for the year ended october 31, 2018 increased 22 percent when compared to 2017. foreign currency movements had a favorable impact of 2 percentage points on the year-over-year comparison. revenue associated with acquisitions accounted for 6 percentage points of revenue growth for the year ended october 31, 2018 when compared to 2017. revenue excluding acquisitions grew year over year, with growth in all our operating segments and across all our markets. net revenue of $3,189 million for the year ended october 31, 2017 increased 9 percent when compared to 2016. foreign currency movements had a negligible impact on the year-over-year comparison. revenue associated with acquisitions accounted for 7 percentage points of revenue growth for the year ended october 31, 2017 when compared to 2016. revenue excluding acquisitions grew year over year, with growth in the electronic industrial solutions group driven by semiconductor measurement and automotive and energy markets, and growth in the services solutions group. the communications solution group revenue was flat as gains in the commercial communications market were offset by declines in the aerospace, defense and government market.
net income was $165 million in 2018 compared to net income of $102 million and $335 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. in 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated operating cash flows of $555 million, $328 million and $420 million, respectively. the increase in net income for the year ended october 31, 2018 when compared to 2017 was driven by higher revenue volume and a favorable tax impact from the new u.s. tax legislation and singapore tax incentives, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from a goodwill impairment charge and increases in variable people-related costs. the decline in net income for the year ended october 31, 2017 when compared to 2016 is primarily driven by the unfavorable impact from amortization of acquisition-related balances.
impact of northern california wildfires during the week of october 8, 2017, wildfires in northern california adversely impacted the keysight corporate headquarters site in santa rosa, ca. our headquarters was under mandatory evacuation for more than three weeks, and while direct damage to our core facilities was limited, our buildings did experience some smoke and other fire-related impacts. cleaning and restoration efforts are largely complete, and we have fully re-occupied the site. keysight is insured for the damage caused by the fire.
for the years ended october 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized costs of $7 million and $16 million, respectively, net of estimated insurance recoveries of $90 million and $2 million, respectively. expenses were primarily for cleaning and restoration activities, write-off of damaged fixed assets and other direct costs related to recovery from this event.
as of october 31, 2018, we have received insurance proceeds of $68 million and have a receivable of $24 million for losses and expenses for which insurance reimbursement is probable. the receivable is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. in addition, for the year ended october 31, 2018, we made investments in property, plant and equipment related to fire recovery of $27 million, which is expected to be covered by insurance. in many cases, our insurance coverage exceeds the amount of these covered losses, but no gain contingencies have been recognized as our ability to realize those gains remains uncertain for financial reporting purposes. we currently estimate total insurance recovery to range from $125 million to $135 million, which will substantially cover our total fire-related losses, expenses and investments in property, plant and equipment in excess of our $10 million self-insured retention amount. there may be a difference in timing of costs incurred and the related insurance reimbursement.
outlook looking forward, we believe our investments in r&d combined with our completed acquisitions, which have expanded our technology portfolio and the size of our addressable market, position keysight for growth. we remain focused on delivering value through differentiated and first-to-market solutions targeted at faster growing markets where customers are investing in next-generation digital and electronic technologies. internally, we are continuously working to improve operational efficiency within and across all functions. while current macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties exist related to trade, tariffs, monetary and fiscal policies, we expect continued sales growth.
currency exchange rate exposure our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. we hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short-term and anticipated basis. the result of the hedging has been included in our consolidated statement of operations. we experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis of up to a rolling twelve-month period. therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. to the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the u.s. dollar cost of the transaction.
orders and net revenue in general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services. consistent with our strategy, we are seeing an increase in solution sales, which have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle; however, the majority of recorded orders will be delivered within six months.
revenue reflects the delivery and acceptance of the products and services as defined on the customer's terms and conditions. cancellations are recorded in the period received from the customer and historically have not been material.

backlog backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers.
at october 31, 2018, our unfilled backlog was approximately $1,275 million as compared to approximately $950 million at october 31, 2017. consistent with our strategy, we are seeing an increase in solution sales, which have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle; however, we expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months. while backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of short-term revenue performance, it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.

gross margin increased 1 percentage point in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by gains related to revenue volume and favorable mix, partially offset by increases in variable people-related costs and amortization of acquisition-related balances. gross margin declined 2 percentage points in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by the unfavorable impacts from amortization of acquisition-related balances, northern california wildfire-related costs, an increase in people-related costs and an increase in warranty expense due to a lower compare as a result of a one-time reduction in the standard warranty accrual in 2016.
excess and obsolete inventory charges were $25 million in 2018, $16 million in 2017 and $17 million in 2016. in 2018, excess and obsolete inventory-related charges included $7 million related to divestiture activity. sales of previously written-down inventory were $2 million in 2018, $1 million in 2017 and $2 million in 2016.
research and development expense increased 22 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by the addition of acquisitions to our cost structure, an increase in variable people-related costs and our continued investment in research and development programs, partially offset by elimination of non-recurring acquisition-related compensation expense. as a percent of total revenue, research and development expenses were 16 percent in both 2018 and 2017. research and development expense increased 17 percent in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by the addition of acquisitions to the cost structure, an increase in people-related costs, acquisition-related compensation costs and our continued investment in research and development programs. as a percent of total revenue, research and development expense increased 1 percentage point to 16 percent in 2017 from 15 percent in 2016.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13 percent for 2018 compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by the addition of acquisitions to our cost structure and increases in variable people-related, litigation and restructuring costs, partially offset by elimination of non-recurring acquisition-related compensation expense, separation and related costs, acquisition and integration costs and the unfavorable impact from northern california wildfire-related costs. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 28 percent for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by the addition of ixia to our cost structure, increases in amortization of acquisition-related balances, acquisition and integration costs, acquisition-related compensation expense, investments in sales resources, people-related costs and the unfavorable impact from fire-related costs at our corporate headquarters and restructuring-related costs.
during the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $709 million for the ixia solutions group, based on the results of our annual impairment test of goodwill. see note 10, "goodwill and other intangible assets," to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other operating expense (income), net for 2018 was income of $33 million, which primarily includes income from business divestitures and rental income. other operating expense (income), net for 2017 was income of $84 million, which primarily includes a $68 million gain from a settlement related to our japan pension fund and rental income.
operating margin decreased 16 percentage points in 2018 when compared to 2017, primarily driven by goodwill impairment and an increase in variable people-related costs, partially offset by gains related to revenue volume and favorable mix. operating margin decreased 6 percentage points in 2017 when compared to 2016, primarily driven by increases in amortization of acquisition-related balances, acquisition and integration costs, investments in sales resources and people-related costs, partially offset by favorable impact from higher revenue and revenue mix.
interest expense interest expense for the years ended october 31, 2018 and 2017 was $83 million and $80 million, respectively, and primarily relates to interest on our senior notes issued in october 2014 and april 2017.

for 2018, the effective tax rate was 140 percent, which is higher than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of u.s. tax law changes, the singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications completed in 2018 in response to singapore tax law changes, and the tax impact of goodwill impairment. the impact of the singapore restructuring includes tax benefits associated with intra-entity asset transfers that were recognized in accordance with asu 2016-16, intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, which we elected to early adopt effective november 1, 2016.
for 2017, the effective tax rate was 43 percent, which is higher than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the payment of a prior year malaysia tax assessment of $68 million, including tax and penalties, which we are currently in the process of appealing to the special commissioners of income tax ("scit") in malaysia.
for 2016, the effective tax rate was 8 percent, which is lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to a higher percentage of earnings in the non-u.s. jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates. also, the tax rate was lower than the u.s. statutory rate due to a net tax benefit of $45 million resulting from the repatriation of earnings from japan, which includes a u.s. tax expense of $27 million, offset by $72 million of foreign tax credits recorded in connection with the repatriation.
we benefit from tax incentives in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in singapore, and several jurisdictions have granted tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future. the tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. the tax incentives are due for renewal between 2024 and 2025. the impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by $567 million, $49 million and $34 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. the increase in the tax benefit from 2017 to 2018 is primarily due to the impact of our singapore restructuring and tax incentive modifications that were completed in 2018 in response to singapore tax law changes.
in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.
the open tax years for the irs and most states are from november 1, 2014 through the current tax year. for the majority of our foreign entities, the open tax years are from august 1, 2014 through the current tax year. for certain foreign entities, the tax years remain open, at most, back to the year 2007. given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.
the company is being audited in malaysia for the 2008 tax year. although this tax year pre-dates our spin-off from agilent, pursuant to the agreement between agilent and keysight pertaining to tax matters, as finalized at the time of separation, for certain entities, including malaysia, any historical tax liability is the responsibility of keysight. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, keysight paid income taxes and penalties of $68 million on gains related to intellectual property rights, although we are currently in the process of appealing to the scit in malaysia. the company believes there are numerous defenses to the current assessment; the statute of limitations for the 2008 tax year in malaysia was closed, and the income in question is exempt from tax in malaysia. the company is disputing this assessment and pursuing all avenues to resolve this issue favorably for the company.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive federal tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act includes significant changes to the u.s. corporate income tax system, including
but not limited to: the transition of u.s. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which will result in a one-time u.s. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the u.s. (the "transition tax"); creation of new minimum taxes, such as the global intangible low taxed income ("gilti") tax and the base erosion anti-abuse tax; a federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent; and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation.
the corporate tax rate reduction is effective as of january 1, 2018. since the company has a fiscal year rather than a calendar year, it is subject to rules relating to transitional tax rates. as a result, the company's fiscal year 2018 federal statutory rate will be a blended rate of 23.34 percent.
due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the tax act, the sec staff has issued staff accounting bulletin 118 ("sab 118") directing companies to consider the impact of the tax act as "provisional" when they do not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for the change in tax law. for the amounts that we were able to reasonably estimate, we recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $89 million as of october 31, 2018. this benefit is made up of a one-time reduction in net deferred tax liabilities and corresponding income tax benefit of approximately $304 million due to the re-measurement of u.s. income taxes recorded on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not considered permanently reinvested. this was offset by approximately $205 million of income tax expense and corresponding long-term income tax payable due to the one-time transition tax. we also estimated a one-time reduction in net deferred tax assets and corresponding income tax expense of approximately $10 million due to the re-measurement of the u.s. deferred tax assets at the lower 21 percent u.s. federal corporate income tax rate.
due to the complexity of the new tax act rules, we are continuing to evaluate the gilti provisions and whether such gilti taxes are recorded as a current-period expense when incurred or whether such amounts should be factored into a company's measurement of its deferred taxes.
we are continuing to evaluate the tax act and its requirements, as well as its application to our business and its impact on our effective tax rate. in accordance with sab 118, the estimated income tax benefit of $89 million represents our best estimate based on interpretation of the tax act. we are able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of the transition tax, the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability recorded on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not considered reinvested, the current year impact of gilti, and the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate. the final impact of the tax act may differ from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in our interpretations and assumptions based on additional guidance that may be issued by the u.s. treasury and changes to u.s. state conformance to the u.s. federal tax law change. in addition, certain provisions of the new tax act are not applicable to keysight until fiscal year 2019. these include the foreign-derived intangible income deduction ("fdii") and the base erosion and anti-abuse tax ("beat") provisions. these impacts will be included in the tax provision estimates beginning in fiscal year 2019.
segment overview on april 18, 2017, we completed the acquisition of ixia, which became a separate reportable operating segment, the ixia solutions group. as a result, keysight has four segments: communications solutions group, electronic industrial solutions group, ixia solutions group and services solutions group. the communications solutions group provides electronic design and test software, instruments, and systems spanning the worldwide commercial communications and aerospace, defense and government end markets. the electronic industrial solutions group provides test and measurement solutions across a broad set of electronic industrial end markets. the ixia solutions group provides testing, visibility and security solutions, strengthening applications across physical and virtual networks for enterprises, service providers and network equipment manufacturers. the services solutions group provides repair, calibration and consulting services, and remarkets used keysight equipment. also, our global team of experts provides startup assistance, consulting, optimization and application support across all our end markets.

operating margin decreased 2 percentage points in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily driven by lower gross margin, higher selling costs and increases in variable people-related and infrastructure-related costs. operating margin increased 1 percentage point in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by higher revenue and lower share in r&d expenses, partially offset by increased investment in sales resources.
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our financial position as of october 31, 2018 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $913 million as compared to $818 million as of october 31, 2017.
as of october 31, 2018, approximately $782 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the u.s. in our foreign subsidiaries. our cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of short-term deposits held at major global financial institutions, investments in institutional money market funds, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. we continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the financial institutions in which we invest our funds. we utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. most significant international locations have access to internal funding through an offshore cash pool for working capital needs. in addition, a few locations that are unable to access internal funding have access to temporary local overdraft and short-term working capital lines of credit.
we believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.
net cash provided by operating activities cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding, variable pay and other items impact reported cash flows.
net cash provided by operating activities was $555 million for the year ended october 31, 2018 as compared to $328 million provided in 2017 and $420 million provided in 2016.
•   net income in 2018 increased by $63 million as compared to 2017. non-cash adjustments in 2018 increased $111 million compared to the same period last year, due to a $709 million goodwill impairment, a $74 million increase in amortization expense, a $70 million increase from a prior-period pension curtailment and settlement gain, an $11 million increase in depreciation expense and $1 million from other miscellaneous non-cash activities, partially offset by $742 million reduction in the adjustment for deferred tax benefits and $12 million gain on the sale of assets and divestitures.
•   the aggregate of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable used net cash of $128 million during 2018, compared to net cash used of zero in 2017 and $72 million in 2016. the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable depends on the cash conversion cycle, which represents the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from our customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of shipments and purchases, as well as collections and payments in a period.
•   the aggregate of employee compensation and benefits, income taxes payable, deferred revenue, and other assets and liabilities provided net operating cash of $335 million during 2018 as compared to net cash provided of $42 million and net cash used of $22 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the difference between 2018 and 2017 activities is primarily due to an increase in the u.s. federal income tax payable due to the impact of new u.s. tax legislation, higher variable compensation accruals and other differences due to timing of accruals, collections and payments between the periods. in
2018, we received insurance proceeds of $68 million for expenses associated with the northern california wildfires, which partially offset estimated insurance recoveries of $90 million during the period. at october 31, 2018 our insurance receivable was $24 million for known losses for which insurance reimbursement is probable. in addition, in 2018, we received insurance proceeds of $26 million for losses incurred in a 2016 warehouse fire in singapore.
•   net cash used for retirement and post-retirement benefits was $127 million, $15 million and $32 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. in 2018, we made an accelerated contribution of $85 million to our u.s. defined benefit plans to secure tax deductibility at the current corporate rate prior to new tax legislation taking effect, as compared to zero contributions in 2017 and 2016. we also contributed $33 million to our non-u.s. defined benefit plans during 2018 compared to $34 million in 2017 and $38 million in 2016. we did not contribute to the u.s. post-retirement benefit plan in 2018 and 2017, and we contributed $1 million in 2016.
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $116 million, $1,722 million and $90 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. investments in property, plant and equipment were $132 million, $72 million and $91 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 2018 capital spending includes $27 million related to recovery from the northern california wildfires.
in 2018, we paid $11 million for acquisitions and also received proceeds of $29 million from divestitures. in 2017, we paid $1,622 million, net of $72 million of cash acquired, for the acquisition of ixia, $60 million for the acquisition of scienlab, net of $2 million of cash acquired, and $20 million, net, for other acquisition activity. in 2016, we used $10 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of a small business and a contingent payment related to the anite acquisition.
we received $8 million of proceeds from the sale of land in 2017 compared to $10 million in 2016. we also received $45 million of proceeds from the sale of investments in 2017 as compared to $1 million in 2016.
net cash used in financing activities net cash used by financing activities in 2018 was $335 million compared to $1,425 million provided in 2017 and $29 million used in 2016. in 2018, we used $335 million for financing activities primarily for a $260 million repayment of term loan borrowings, $120 million for treasury stock purchases and $18 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by proceeds of $64 million from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.
in 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $1,425 million primarily due to proceeds used to fund the acquisition of ixia, including the issuance of long-term debt of $1,069 million, short-term borrowings of $212 million, and the issuance of common stock under public offering of $444 million, net of issuance costs. we repaid $323 million of the borrowings in 2017, including $182 million of the revolving facility, $140 million of the term loan and a $1 million short-term loan acquired with the acquisition of scienlab. in addition, during 2017, we issued common stock under employee stock plans of $51 million and had $12 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards.
in 2016, we used $29 million for financing activities primarily due to $62 million for treasury stock purchases and $9 million of tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by proceeds of $43 million from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.
short-term debt revolving credit facility on february 15, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the "revolving credit facility") that replaced our existing $450 million unsecured credit facility dated september 15, 2014. the revolving credit facility provides for a $450 million, five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on february 15, 2022 and bears interest at an annual rate of libor + 1.30%. in addition, the revolving credit facility permits us to increase the total commitments under this credit facility by up to $150 million in the aggregate on one or more occasions upon request. we may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. during the year ended october 31, 2018, we borrowed and repaid $40 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. as of october 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. we were in compliance with the covenants of the revolving credit facility during the year ended october 31, 2018.
bridge facility on january 30, 2017, we entered into a commitment letter, pursuant to which certain lenders agreed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility of up to $1.684 billion ("the bridge facility") for the purpose of providing the financing to support keysight's acquisition of ixia. under the terms of commitment letter, the bridge facility was automatically terminated upon the ixia acquisition on april 18, 2017. for the year ended october 31, 2017, we incurred costs in connection with the bridge facility of $9 million that were amortized to interest expense.
2019 senior notes in october 2014, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes ("2019 senior notes"). the 2019 senior notes were issued at 99.902 percent of their principal amount. the notes will mature on october 30, 2019, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.30 percent per annum. the interest is payable semi-annually on april 30 and october 30 of each year. the 2019 senior notes are repayable within one year and have been reclassified to short-term debt.
2027 senior notes in april 2017, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $700 million in senior notes ("2027 senior notes"). the 2027 senior notes were issued at 99.873 percent of their principal amount. the notes will mature on april 6, 2027 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.60 percent per annum. the interest is payable semi-annually on april 6 and october 6 of each year, commencing on october 6, 2017. we incurred issuance costs of $6 million in connection with the 2027 senior notes that, along with the debt discount of $1 million, are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior notes. the 2027 senior notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness.
senior unsecured term loan on february 15, 2017, we entered into a term credit agreement that provides for a three-year $400 million senior unsecured term loan that bears interest at an annual rate of libor + 1.50%. the term loan was drawn upon the closing of the ixia acquisition. on february 27, 2018, we fully repaid borrowings outstanding under the term loan of $260 million and terminated the term credit agreement. we had previously repaid $140 million of the term loan during the year ended october 31, 2017.
off balance sheet arrangements and other we have contractual commitments for non-cancellable operating leases. see note 16, "commitments and contingencies," to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancellable operating leases.
our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. as a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.
the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31, 2018 (in millions). the amounts presented in the table do not reflect $120 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31, 2018. we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. however, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.

interest on senior notes.  we have contractual obligations for interest payments on our senior notes. interest rates and payment dates are detailed above under "short-term debt" and "long-term debt".
operating leases.  commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property, see note 16, "commitments and contingencies."
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.  we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. the reported purchase commitments represent the commitments under open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not been received. however, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us with the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to firm orders being placed. we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.
in addition to the commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers referenced above, we record a liability for firm, non-cancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. as of october 31, 2018, the liability for our excess firm, non-cancellable and unconditional purchase commitments was $17 million, compared to $10 million as of october 31, 2017. these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
retirement plans.  commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our non-u.s. defined benefit plans for the next year only. contributions beyond the next year are impractical to estimate.
we also have benefit payments due under our defined benefit retirement plans and post-retirement benefit plan that are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid in the same period that benefits are provided. see item 8-financial statements and supplementary data, note 14, "retirement plans and post-retirement benefit plans," for additional information.
u.s. transition tax liability. the obligation for the u.s. transition tax liability relates to the one-time u.s. tax on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the u.s. (the "transition tax"). keysight has elected to pay the transition tax over 8 years. see item 7. management's discussion and analysis, "income taxes," for additional information on the transition tax.
other purchase commitments. other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers. we can typically cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties. for those contracts that are not cancellable within 90 days without penalties, we disclose the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be canceled. as of october 31, 2018, our contractual obligations with these suppliers was approximately $59 million within the next fiscal year, as compared to approximately $42 million as of october 31, 2017.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be
reasonable. although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, warranty, loss contingencies, restructuring and accounting for income taxes.
revenue recognition.  we enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple-element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, for products, or when the service has been provided. revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. for sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. for products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. we allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence ("vsoe") if available, third-party evidence ("tpe") if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price ("esp") if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules. revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements.
we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists. vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately. tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors, it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe. esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including, but not limited to customer type, geography, market conditions, competitive landscape, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management. we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future. as these pricing strategies evolve, changes may occur in esp. the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple-element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.
recent updates to revenue recognition. in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standard update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers, which became effective for us beginning november 1, 2018. for additional information on the new revenue recognition guidance and the expected impact of adoption, see note 2, "new accounting pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements.
inventory valuation.  we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
share-based compensation.  we account for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors. the fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. awards granted under the ltp program are based on a variety of targets, such as total shareholder return ("tsr") or financial metrics such as operating margin, cost synergies and others. the awards based on
tsr were valued using a monte carlo simulation model and those based on financial metrics were valued based on the market price of keysight's common stock on the date of grant. both the black-scholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. the estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of keysight's common stock on the date of grant. we did not grant any option awards in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.  retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and investment portfolio composition. we evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date, which is october 31 for both u.s. and non-u.s. plans. the u.s. discount rates as of october 31, 2018 and 2017 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. the non-u.s. discount rates as of october 31, 2018 and 2017 were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates. in addition, we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost: service cost and interest cost. if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be $6 million on u.s. net periodic benefit cost and $11 million on non-u.s. net periodic benefit cost. lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense.
the company uses alternate methods of amortization, as allowed by the authoritative guidance, that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. for u.s. plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime. for most non-u.s. plans and u.s. post-retirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. the expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. plan assets are valued at fair value. if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $7 million on u.s. net periodic benefit cost and $15 million on non-u.s. net periodic benefit cost.
goodwill and other intangible assets. we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. as defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. we aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. at the time of an acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing a quantitative test is necessary. if an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. otherwise, no further testing will be required.
the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. these examples include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. the qualitative indicators replace those previously used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required. if it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill.
in 2018, we performed our annual impairment test for all our reporting units. based on the results of our testing, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value, except for our isg reporting unit. as a result, we recorded impairment losses of $709 million for isg. see note 10, "goodwill and other intangible assets" of the consolidated financial statements for additional information. there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31, 2017 and 2016.
other intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and backlog and are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 months to 10 years. no impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended october 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. our indefinite-lived intangible assets are in-process research and development ("ipr&d") intangible assets. in 2018 and 2017, we assessed impairment by performing a qualitative test and recorded an impairment charge of $5 million and $7 million, respectively, related to the cancellation of an ipr&d project. there were no impairments in fiscal year 2016.
warranty.  effective december 1, 2017, keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year. warranties for products sold through distribution channels continue to be primarily for three years. we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges. the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized.
we also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term. revenue associated with extended warranties is deferred and recognized over the extended coverage period.
loss contingencies. as discussed in note 15 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, we are, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). we recognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. in addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors. changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operation.
restructuring.  the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions. workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated. if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded.
accounting for income taxes.  we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. when it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. we consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. at october 31, 2018, the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to deferred tax assets for california research credits, capital losses in the u.k., and net operating losses in the u.k. and netherlands. we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being
recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.

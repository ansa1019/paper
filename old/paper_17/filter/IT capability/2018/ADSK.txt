item 1a. risk factors we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, a number of which are beyond our control. in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business, financial condition, and future results of operations. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted, causing the trading price of our common stock to decline. in addition, these risks and uncertainties may impact the "forward-looking" statements described elsewhere in this form 10-k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference. they could affect our actual results of operations, causing them to differ materially from those expressed in "forward-looking" statements.
global economic and political conditions may further impact our industries, business and financial results.
our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions. the united states and other international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, decreased government spending, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. these economic conditions can occur abruptly. if economic growth in countries where we do business slows or if such countries experience further economic recessions, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases. our customers include government entities, including the u.s. federal government, and if spending cuts impede the ability of governments to purchase our products and services, our revenue could decline. in addition, a number of our customers rely, directly and indirectly, on government spending.
geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of, or otherwise interfere with, conducting business. these trends have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally, and may increase the volatility of global financial markets; the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain. political instability or adverse political developments in any of the countries in which we do business could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
a financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers, including our distribution partners and channels. a disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counter-parties and could also impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management. any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance, costs related to product defects, and large expenditures, each of which may not result in additional net revenue or could result in decreased net revenue.
rapid technological changes, as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences, characterize the software industry. just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry 30 years ago, the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to cloud, mobile and social applications. customers are also reconsidering the manner in which they purchase software products, which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy. in response, we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects. we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies. in addition, we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as our introduction of flexible subscription and service offerings. it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services, as well as through acquisitions. such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue or profitability. if we are not able to meet customer requirements, either with respect to our software or the manner in which we provide such products, or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers' requirements, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
in particular, a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloud-based functionality. we want customers using individual autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our other offerings and cloud-based functionality, and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration. at times, sales of our autocad and autocad lt or individual autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in industry collections or cloud-based functionality revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our industry collections. should this continue, our results of operations will be adversely affected.
our executive management team must act quickly, continuously, and with vision, given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry, the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing, mobile devices, new computing platforms, and other technologies, such as consumer products. although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges, if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, we may fail to meet our customers' expectations, fail to compete with our competitors' products and technology, and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees. this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
our business could suffer as a result of risks, costs, charges and integration risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments such as the recent acquisitions of assemble systems, inc., plangrid, inc. and buildingconnected, inc.
we regularly acquire or invest in businesses, software solutions and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions, strategic alliances or equity or debt investments. for example, we recently acquired assemble systems, plangrid and buildingconnected. the risks associated with such acquisitions include, among others, the difficulty of assimilating solutions, operations and personnel, inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims, the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections, the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, and the diversion of management's time and attention.
in addition, such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as:
•   the inability to retain customers, key employees, vendors, distributors, business partners, and other entities associated with the acquired business;
•   exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, or other third parties;
•   the potential additional exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and
•   the potential impact on relationships with existing customers, vendors, and distributors as business partners as a result of acquiring another business.
we may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. in addition, such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. these fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments. these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period, cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods.
we are dependent on international revenue and operations, exposing us to significant regulatory, global economic, intellectual property, collections, currency exchange rate, taxation, political instability and other risks, which could adversely impact our financial results.
we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue. international net revenue represented 66% and 64% of our net revenue in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. our international revenue, including that from emerging economies, is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets, including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the u.s. our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time. at times, these factors adversely impact our international revenue, and consequently our business as a whole. our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends, which can negatively impact our financial results, even if our results in the u.s. are strong for a particular period.
•   economic volatility;
•   fluctuating currency exchange rates, including devaluations, currency controls and inflation, and risks related to any hedging activities we undertake;
•   operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices, particularly in emerging economies;
•   increasing enforcement by the u.s. under the foreign corrupt practices act, and adoption of stricter anti-corruption laws in certain countries, including the united kingdom;
•   local competition;
•   tax arrangements with foreign governments, including our ability to meet and renew the terms of those tax arrangements;
•   possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses;
•   increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
the "brexit" vote has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. the withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties. there remains significant risk that the united kingdom will exit from the european union without agreement between the european union and united kingdom on terms addressing customs and trade matters. further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom, european union and the other economies in which we operate.
in addition, the current u.s. administration has instituted or proposed changes to foreign trade policy including the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries, economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries in which we do business. new or increased tariffs and other changes in u.s. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments, including the chinese government, have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain u.s. manufactured goods. the escalation of protectionist or retaliatory trade measures in either the united states or any other countries in which we do business, such as a change in tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may increase the cost of, or otherwise interfere with, conducting our business.
security incidents may compromise the integrity of our or our customers' offerings, services, data or intellectual property, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results.
as we digitize autodesk and use cloud and web-based technologies to leverage customer data to deliver the total customer experience, we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to, or improper use of, our and our customers' information. like other software offerings and systems, ours are vulnerable to security incidents. we devote resources to maintain the security and integrity of our systems, offerings, services and applications (online, mobile and desktop). we accomplish this by enhancing security features, conducting penetration tests, code hardening, releasing security vulnerability updates and accelerating our incident response time. despite these efforts, we may not prevent security incidents.
hackers regularly have targeted our systems, offerings, services and applications, and we expect them to do so in the future. security incidents could disrupt the proper functioning of our systems, solutions or services; cause errors in the output of our customers' work; allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or intellectual property, including proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers; or cause other destructive outcomes.
the risk of a security incident, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. these threats include but are not limited to identity theft, unauthorized access, dns attacks, wireless network attacks, viruses and worms, advanced persistent threat (apt), application centric attacks, peer-to-peer attacks, phishing, malicious file uploads, backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service (ddos) attacks. in addition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, vendors, partners or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our users' data and there is the risk of employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance. despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk.
if any of the foregoing security incidents were to occur, our reputation may suffer, our competitive position may be diminished, customers may stop paying for our solutions and services, we could face regulator inquiry, lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.
increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws may impact our business or expose us to increased liability.
our strategy to digitize autodesk involves increasing our use of cloud and web-based technologies and applications to leverage customer data to improve our offerings for the benefit of our customers. to accomplish this strategy, we must collect customer data, which may include personal data. federal, state and foreign government privacy and data security laws apply to the treatment of personal data. governments, regulators, the plaintiffs' bar, privacy advocates and customers have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data.
the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") is applicable in all eu member states the gdpr introduced new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for non-compliance. in addition, in june 2018, california enacted the california consumer privacy act (the "ccpa"), which takes effect in january 2020.  the ccpa will, among other things, give california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used.  the ccpa was amended in september 2018, and it is unclear whether further modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted.  we cannot yet predict the impact of the ccpa on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.
the gdpr, ccpa and other state and global laws and regulations increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data, and we have and will continue to put in place additional processes and programs to demonstrate compliance. any failure to comply with the gdpr or other data privacy laws could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties. any perceived privacy right violation could result in reputational harm, third-party claims, lawsuits or investigations.
additionally, we store customer information and content and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us. the gdpr, ccpa other laws and self-regulatory codes may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers, to understand how our offerings and services are being used, to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws, and to implement our new business models effectively. these new laws and regulations would similarly affect our competitors as well as our customers. these requirements could impact demand for our offerings and services and result in more onerous contract obligations.
we rely on third-parties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services; third-party security incidents could expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial performance.
we rely on third parties, such as amazon web services, to provide us with operational and technical services. these third parties may have access to our systems, provide hosting services, or otherwise process data about us or our customers, employees, or partners. any third-party security incident could compromise the integrity of, or availability or result in the theft of, data. in addition, our operations, or the operations of our customers or partners, could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach, and could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information, including source code. unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through break-ins, network breaches by unauthorized parties, employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct. if any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation may suffer, our competitive position may be diminished, customers may buy fewer of our offerings and services, we could face lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.
delays in service from third-party service providers could expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial performance.
from time to time, we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country, for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our solutions. the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. if any of these situations were to occur, our reputation could be harmed, we could be subject to third party liability, including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.
we are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems to digitize autodesk and support our customers. should our investments not succeed, or if delays or other issues with new or existing information technology systems disrupt our operations, our business could be harmed.
we rely on our network and data center infrastructure, technology systems and our websites for our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting and financial reporting activities. we continually invest resources to update and improve these systems in order to meet the evolving requirements of our business and customers. in particular, our transition to cloud-based products and a subscription-only business model involves considerable investment in the development of technologies, as well as back-office systems for technical, financial, compliance and sales resources.
such improvements are often complex, costly and time consuming. in addition, such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems, or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems. unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations, loss of customers, loss of revenue, errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation, all of which could harm our business.
our customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings, and they may elect not to renew. we cannot assure renewal rates, or the mix of subscriptions renewals. customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors, including offering pricing, competitive offerings, customer satisfaction, and reductions in customer spending levels or customer activity due to economic downturns or financial markets uncertainty. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms, our revenues may decline.
our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors, defects or vulnerabilities, each of which could harm our business and financial performance.
the software solutions that we offer are complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain errors, defects or vulnerabilities. some errors, defects and vulnerabilities in our software solutions may only be discovered after they have been released. any errors, defects or vulnerabilities could result in the need for corrective releases to our software solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenue, an increase in subscription cancellations or lack of market acceptance of our offerings, any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance.
existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits.
the software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to cloud, mobile and social applications. this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies. the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition, both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary offerings and technologies. in addition, some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, and other resources. furthermore, a reduction in the number and availability of compatible third-party applications, or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices, and new computing platforms, may adversely affect the sale of our solutions. because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future. increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would likely harm our business.
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.
our offerings are subject to u.s. export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the delivery of certain solutions and services without the required export authorizations or export to locations, governments, and persons targeted by u.s. sanctions. while we have processes in place to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws, including obtaining authorizations as appropriate and screening against u.s. government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons, we cannot guarantee that these processes will prevent all violations of export control and sanctions laws.
we also note that if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties. we presently incorporate export control and sanctions compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements. complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. violations of u.s. sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or penalties.
because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the u.s., we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change. our exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.
we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. as part of our risk management strategy, we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets, liabilities, and other obligations, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to twelve months in the future, and provide us with some protection against currency exposures. however, our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results.
the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility, we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk, and in any case, will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs. such volatility, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.
in addition, countries in which we operate may be classified as highly inflationary economies, requiring special accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations, or such countries' currencies may be devalued, or both, which may adversely impact our business operations and financial results.
if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel, our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected. if our distribution channel suffers financial losses, becomes financially unstable or insolvent, or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our subscriptions, our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected.
we sell our software products both directly to end-users and through a network of distributors and resellers. for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, approximately 71% and 70%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future. our ability to effectively distribute our solutions depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network. computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized, have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years. we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them. in the past we have taken steps to support them, and may take additional steps in the future, such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts. these steps, if taken, could harm our financial results. if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent, they would not be able to maintain their business and sales, or provide customer support services, which would negatively impact our business and revenue.
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the u.s. and international regions, including the distributor tech data. tech data accounted for 35% and 31% of our total net revenue for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data, if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate, it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be, at least temporarily, negatively impacted. this could in turn negatively impact our financial results.
over time, we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers, such as their incentive programs, pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives. changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business. further, our distributors and resellers may lose confidence in our business, move to competitive products, or may not have the skills or ability to support customers. the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers could harm our business. in particular, if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us, we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers. these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict.
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future. these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines. we also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forward-looking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations. in addition to the other factors described in this part i, item 1a, some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include:
•   general market, economic, business, and political conditions in particular geographies, including europe, apac, and emerging economies;
•   failure to produce sufficient revenue, arr, billings, subscription, profitability and cash flow growth;
•   failure to accurately predict the impact of acquired businesses or to identify and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, and successfully integrate such acquired businesses and technologies;
•   weak or negative growth in one or more of the industries we serve, including aec, manufacturing, and digital media and entertainment markets;
•   the success of new business or sales initiatives;
•   security breaches, related reputational harm, and potential financial penalties to customers and government entities;
•   timing of additional investments in our technologies or deployment of our services;
•   changes in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us and/or established by the financial accounting standards board, securities exchange commission or other rule-making bodies;
•   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the effectiveness of our hedging activity;
•   changes in billings linearity;
•   the ability of governments around the world to adopt fiscal policies, meet their financial and debt obligations, and to finance infrastructure projects;
•   our ability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices and new computing platforms;
•   the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
•   the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels;
•   perceived or actual technical or other problems with a product or combination of subscriptions;
•   unexpected or negative outcomes of matters and expenses relating to litigation or regulatory inquiries;
•   increases in cloud functionality-related expenses;
•   changes in tax laws or regulations, tax arrangements with foreign governments or accounting rules, such as increased use of fair value measures;
•   the timing and degree of expected investments in growth and efficiency opportunities;
•   potential goodwill impairment charges related to prior acquisitions; and
we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions. in particular, our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period, and our apac operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters.
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term. accordingly, any revenue shortfall below expectations has had, and in the future could have, an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability. greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability.
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of subscriptions of a limited number of our offerings, including autocad software, solutions based on autocad, which include our collections that serve specific markets and products that are interoperable with autocad. any factor adversely affecting sales of these subscriptions, including the product release cycle, market acceptance, product competition, performance and reliability, reputation, price competition, economic and market conditions and the availability of third-party applications, would likely harm our financial results. during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products, not including collections having autocad or autocad lt as a component, represented 28% and 27% of our total net revenue, respectively.
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations.
we have $2.1 billion of debt, consisting of notes due at various times from june 2020 to june 2027 and a delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million due in december 2020, each as described in part 2, item 8. we also entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million, with an option to be increased up to $1.0 billion, as described in part 2, item 8. maintenance of our indebtedness, contractual restrictions, and additional issuances of indebtedness could:
•   increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;
•   impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; and
•   due to limitations within the debt instruments, restrict our ability to grant liens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of autodesk and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, materially change our business and incur subsidiary indebtedness, subject to customary exceptions.
we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our debt instruments, such as an interest coverage ratio in effect january 31, 2019 and a leverage ratio in effect july 31, 2019. if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, we would not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the credit agreement described in part 2, item 8 and any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities. under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our credit agreement could increase. downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing.
we rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary. policing unauthorized use of our software is time-consuming and costly. we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem, particularly in emerging economies. furthermore, our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.
additionally, we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets, including our source code. if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third-parties to compete with our offerings by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation. we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. however, it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization. if this were to occur, it may be difficult and/or costly for us to enforce our rights, and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted.
as more software patents are granted worldwide, the number of offerings and competitors in our industries grows and the functionality of products in different industries overlaps, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims. infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been, and may in the future be, asserted against us, and any such assertions could harm our business. additionally, certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents. any such claims or threats, whether with or without merit, have been and could in the future be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, cause product delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. in addition, such royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, which would likely harm our business.
from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives; if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.
as part of our effort to accommodate our customers' needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology, we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations, offering software as a service, and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency. we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful, and at times, we have been met with short-term challenges in the execution of such initiatives. market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers' needs at the right time and price. often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis. if any of our assumptions about expenses, revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect, or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, and our financial results will be negatively impacted.
net revenue, arr, billings, earnings, cash flow or subscriptions shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including the other factors described in this part i, item 1a and the following:
•   quarterly variations in our or our competitors' results of operations;
•   general socio-economic, political or market conditions;
•   uncertainty about certain governments' abilities to repay debt or effect fiscal policy;
•   the announcement of new offerings or enhancements by us or our competitors;
•   unusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, regulatory actions, and litigation;
•   other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as instability affecting the economy or the operating performance of our competitors.
significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and time-consuming litigation. historically, after periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation. this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management's attention and resources.
our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, professional, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. historically, competition for these key personnel has been intense. the loss of services of any of our key personnel (including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions), the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals.
our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends, market volatility, and other economic factors. if general economic conditions decline, this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate, illiquidity in the financial marketplace, and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments, leading to impairment in the value of our investments.
it is our policy to invest our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with, and in the custody of, financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution, type of security and issuer. however, we are subject to general economic conditions, interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments, the net realizable value of our investments (including our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities) and our ability to sell them. any one of these factors could reduce our investment income, or result in material charges, which in turn could impact our overall net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share.
from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies. privately held company investments are considered inherently risky. the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as u.s. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies.
a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an other-than-temporary impairment charge. the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share. in any of these scenarios, our liquidity may be negatively impacted, which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business, taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due.
we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries, and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future, all of which are costly, distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome, or a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or the trading prices for our securities.
we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies. as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved, we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries. like many other high technology companies, the number and frequency of inquiries from u.s. and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices, and the business practices of others in our industry, have increased in recent years. in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency, we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes. any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, could result in expensive costs of defense, costly damage awards, injunctive relief, increased costs of business, fines or orders to change certain business practices, significant dedication of management time, diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business. in any of these cases, our financial results, results of operations, cash flows or the trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted.
we are a u.s.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. our effective tax rate is primarily based on our expected geographic mix of earnings, statutory rates, intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop, value and license our intellectual property, and enacted tax rules. significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. while we believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate.
tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. for example, the u.s. government enacted significant tax law changes in december 2017, the tax act, which impacted our tax obligations and effective tax rate beginning in our fiscal 2018 tax year. increasingly, governmental tax authorities are scrutinizing corporate tax strategies. many countries in the european union, as well as other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business. if u.s. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.
the tax act was enacted on december 22, 2017, and provides broad and significant changes to the u.s. tax code and how the u.s. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. due to the complexity and varying interpretations of the tax act, the u.s. department of treasury and other standard-setting bodies have been issuing and will be issuing regulations and interpretative guidance that could significantly impact how we will apply the law and the ultimate impact to our results of operations from the tax act.
the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously provided for in the u.s. tax law. these computations require significant judgments to be made regarding the interpretation of the provisions within the tax act and treasury regulations issued thereunder, along with preparation and analysis of information not previously required. as additional regulatory guidance is issued, we may make amendments to prior year tax returns.
we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including revenue recognition for our hybrid desktop software and cloud service subscriptions, the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions, bonuses, and sabbaticals; and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, partner incentive programs, product returns reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results.
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our offerings to perform key functions. these third-party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, and the software may not be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced by the licensors. the loss of licenses to, or inability to support, maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or delays until equivalent software can be developed, identified, licensed and integrated, which would likely harm our business.
disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business.
our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third-party developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software. some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn. in particular markets, such disruptions have in the past, and would likely in the future, negatively impact these third-party developers and end users, which could harm our business.
additionally, technology created by outsourced product development, whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions, has certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products, adequate transfer of technology know-how and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property.
as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development, our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners.
we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities. we believe our partnering strategy allows us to, among other things, achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings. our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers. independent developers, including those who currently develop solutions for us in the u.s. and throughout the world, may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future. in addition, use of development resources through consulting relationships, particularly in non-u.s. jurisdictions with developing legal systems, may be adversely impacted by, and expose us to risks relating to, evolving employment, export and intellectual property laws. these risks could, among other things, expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules.
our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure, our internal technology systems and our websites. we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use. the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, weather event, telecommunications failure, power failure, cyber attack, terrorism, or war, could adversely impact our business, financial results and financial condition. we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event, however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations. in addition, any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products. this could in turn decrease that country's or region's demand for our products, thereby negatively impacting our financial results.
if we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our long-lived assets, or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, our results of operations would be adversely affected.
our long-lived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist. if impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair values, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would decrease the carrying value of our long-lived assets, as the case may be, and our results of operations would be adversely affected. our deferred tax assets include net operating loss, amortizable tax assets and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. each quarter, we assess the need for a valuation allowance, considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. in fiscal 2016,and in fiscal 2018, we determined that it was more likely than not that autodesk would not realize our u.s. and singapore deferred tax assets, respectively, and established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. we continued to have a full valuation allowance against our u.s. and singapore deferred tax assets in fiscal 2019. changes in the amount of the valuation allowance could result in a material non-cash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and our results of operations could be materially affected. we will continue to perform these tests and any future adjustments may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in our md&a and elsewhere in this form 10-k contains trend analyses and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934. forward-looking statements are any statements that look to future events and consist of, among other things, our business strategies, including those discussed in "strategy" and "overview of fiscal 2019" below, future net revenue, operating expenses, recurring revenue, annualized recurring revenue, cash flow, other future financial results (by product type and geography), subscriptions and annualized revenue per subscription, the effectiveness of our efforts to successfully manage transitions to new markets, our ability to increase our subscription base, expected market trends, the impact of planned and past acquisitions and investment activities, the effects of global economic conditions, the effects of revenue recognition, the effects of recently issued accounting standards, expectations regarding our cash needs, the effects of fluctuations in exchange rates and our hedging activities on our financial results, our ability to successfully expand adoption of our products, our ability to gain market acceptance of new business and sales initiatives, the impact of economic volatility and geopolitical activities in certain countries, particularly emerging economy countries, the timing and amount of purchases under our stock buy-back plan, and the effects of potential non-cash charges on our financial results and the resulting effect on our financial results. in addition, forward-looking statements also consist of statements involving expectations regarding product capability and acceptance, statements regarding our liquidity and short-term and long-term cash requirements, as well as statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as "may," "believe," "could," "anticipate," "would," "might," "plan," "expect," and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report on form 10-k and are subject to business and economic risks. as such, our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth above in part i, item 1a, "risk factors," and in our other reports filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission. we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made, except as required by law.
strategy autodesk makes software for people who make things. if you have ever driven a high-performance car, admired a towering skyscraper, used a smartphone, or watched a great film, chances are you have experienced what millions of autodesk customers are doing with our software. autodesk gives you the power to make anything.
autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers. we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer. just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago, the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and on-premises products to cloud, mobile and social applications.
to address this shift, autodesk made a strategic decision to shift its business model from selling perpetual licenses and maintenance plans to selling subscriptions.
today, we offer subscriptions for individual products and industry collections, flexible enterprise business agreements ("ebas"), and cloud service offerings (collectively referred to as "subscription plan"). subscription plans are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our offerings and to attract a broader range of customers, such as project-based users and small businesses.
our product subscriptions currently represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality, which provides a device-independent, collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders. our cloud offerings, for example, bim 360, shotgun, fusion, and autocad 360 pro, provide tools, including mobile and social capabilities, to streamline design, collaboration, building and manufacturing and data management processes. we believe that customer adoption of these new offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these new services.
industry collections provide our customers with increased access to a broader selection of autodesk solutions and services that exceeds those previously available in suites - simplifying the customers' ability to get access to a complete set of tools for their industry.
we discontinued the sale of new commercial licenses of most individual software products in 2016. additionally, in june 2017, we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings,
to support our strategic priority of re-imagining construction, in fiscal 2019, we strengthened the foundation of our construction solutions with both organic and inorganic investments. in addition to investing in our bim 360 portfolio, we purchased assemble systems for quantity take off functionality, plangrid for document-centric workflows and field execution, and buildingconnected for bidding and estimation processes. the broadened product portfolio will help us expand our presence with sub-contractors, trades people, and building owners.
as part of our manufacturing strategy we continue to attract global manufacturing leaders with our generative design and our fusion technology enhancements.
we sell our products and services globally, through a combination of indirect and direct channels. our indirect channels include value added resellers, direct market resellers, distributors, computer manufacturers, and other software developers. our direct channels include internal sales resources dedicated to selling in our largest accounts, our highly specialized solutions, and business transacted through our online autodesk branded store. see note , "revenue recognition" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the results of our indirect and direct channel sales for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.
we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards direct-only business models. however, we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our customers and revenue. we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies. in addition, we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products.
one of our key strategies is to maintain an open-architecture design of our software products to facilitate third-party development of complementary products and industry-specific software solutions. this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses. we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding, technological platforms, user communities, technical support, forums, and events to developers who develop add-on applications for our products. for example, we have established the autodesk forge program to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed, made, and used as well as support ideas that push the boundaries of 3d printing.
in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology, our large global network of distributors, resellers, third-party developers, customers, educational institutions, educators, and students is a key competitive advantage which has been cultivated over an extensive period of time. this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world. our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase, deploy, learn, and support our solutions quickly and easily. we have a significant number of registered third-party developers who create products that work well with our solutions and extend them for a variety of specialized applications.
autodesk is committed to helping fuel a lifelong passion for making with students of all ages. we offer free educational licenses of autodesk software worldwide to students, educators, and accredited educational institutions. we inspire and support beginners with tinkercad, a simple online 3d design and 3d printing tool. through autodesk design academy, we provide secondary and postsecondary school markets hundreds of standards-aligned class projects to support design-based disciplines in science, technology, engineering, digital arts, and math (steam) while using autodesk's professional-grade 3d design, engineering and entertainment software used in industry. we also have made autodesk design academy curricula available on udemy and coursera. our intention is to make autodesk software ubiquitous and the design and making software of choice for those poised to become the next generation of professional users.
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products, technology, and businesses. for example, we recently acquired assemble systems, a leading provider of key workflow software solutions, plangrid, inc., a leading provider of construction productivity software, and buildingconnected, a leading pre-construction platform. we believe that the acquisitions of assemble systems, plangrid and buildingconnected will enable us to offer a more comprehensive, cloud-based construction platform. acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers; however, they entail cost and integration challenges and may, in certain instances, negatively impact our operating margins. we continually
review these trade-offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions. we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products, technology, and businesses as compelling opportunities become available.
our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions, including: making our technology available to mainstream markets; leveraging our large global network of distributors, resellers, third-party developers, customers, educational institutions, and students; improving the performance and functionality of our products; and adequately protecting our intellectual property. if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations, we may not be able to implement our strategy, which could potentially adversely affect our business. for further discussion regarding these and related risks, see part i, item 1a, "risk factors."
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. in preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. we base our assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. we regularly reevaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates. our significant accounting policies are described in part ii, item 8, note 1, "business and summary of significant accounting policies," in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we believe that of all our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition.    autodesk's revenue is divided into three categories: subscription revenue, maintenance revenue, and other revenue. revenue is recognized when control for these offerings is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services.
our contracts with customers may include promises to provide multiple subscriptions and services to a customer. determining whether the offerings and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation may require significant judgment. judgment is required to determine the level of integration and interdependency between individual components of software and cloud functionality. this determination influences whether the software is considered distinct and accounted for separately as a license performance obligation, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud functionality as a single subscription performance obligation recognized over time.
for product subscriptions, industry collections, and enterprise business agreement ("eba") subscriptions in which the desktop software and related cloud functionality are highly interrelated, the combined performance obligation is recognized ratably over the contract term as the obligation is satisfied. for contracts involving distinct software licenses, the license performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. for standalone maintenance subscriptions, cloud subscriptions, and technical support services, the performance obligation is satisfied ratably over the contract term as those services are delivered. for consulting services, the performance obligation is satisfied over a period of time as those services are delivered.
for contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price ("ssp") of each obligation. judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services.
in instances where ssp is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions and other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer and circumstance. in these instances, we use relevant information such as the sales channel and geographic region to determine the ssp.
our indirect channel model includes both a two-tiered distribution structure, where autodesk sells to distributors that subsequently sell to resellers, and a one-tiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers. for these arrangements, transfer of control begins at the time access to our subscriptions is made available electronically to our end customer, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. judgment is required to determine whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to pay, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. if we were to change this assessment, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
as part of the indirect channel model, we have a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment of monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period. incentives related to our subscription program are recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed, and are subsequently recognized as a reduction to subscription revenue over the contract period. a small portion of partner incentives reduce other revenue in the current period. these incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments. depending on how the payments are made, the reserves associated with the partner incentive program are recorded on the balance sheet as either contra accounts receivable or accounts payable.
the new revenue recognition standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements. refer to part ii, item 8, note 1, business and summary of significant accounting policies, accounting standards adopted, of our consolidated financial statements and to discussions below under the heading "overview" for additional information.
marketable securities and privately held company investments. as described in part ii, item 8, note 3, "financial instruments," in the notes to consolidated financial statements, our investments in marketable securities are measured at the end of each reporting period and reported at fair value. fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. in determining the fair value of our investments, we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques. inputs to valuation techniques are either observable or unobservable. observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities, which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets.
privately held debt and equity securities (level 3) are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. whenever possible, we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available, when determining fair value.
the carrying value is not adjusted for our privately held equity securities if there are no observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. in determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available to us. in addition, the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including: the rights and obligations of the investments, the
all of autodesk's marketable securities and privately held company investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. for any marketable debt securities, declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a reduction to investment income. to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we evaluate, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. for the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income.
for autodesk's quarterly impairment assessment of privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio, the analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including: the investee's financial metrics, the investee's products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, the investee's liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. if the investment is considered to be impaired, the company will record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.
business combinations.    the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations.
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
realizability of long-lived assets.     we assess the realizability of our long-lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, quarterly, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under-performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews. when such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability of these assets.
we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long-lived assets. variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values.
in addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets. any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.
we will continue to evaluate the values of our long-lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges.
income taxes.     we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach. under this method, deferred tax assets, including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits, and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. we recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets a more likely than not threshold. we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered. the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income. as a result of cumulative losses arising from our transition to a subscription model, we considered cumulative losses as a significant source of negative evidence and recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax attributes in singapore, canada and the u.s. jurisdictions.
as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model, tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized; therefore, we will continue to evaluate the evidence around our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets each quarter, both in the u.s. and in foreign jurisdictions, based on all available evidence, both positive and negative.
stock-based compensation. we measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award, and recognize expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. we estimate the fair value of certain stock-based payment awards (including grants of employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan) using either the black-scholes-merton option-pricing model or a binomial-lattice model (e.g., monte carlo simulation model). to determine the grant-date fair value of our stock-based payment awards, we use a black-scholes model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case we use the monte carlo simulation model. the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved. these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award, and expected dividends. the variables used in these models are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted, as needed. share-based compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
legal contingencies. as described in part i, item 3, "legal proceedings" and part ii, item 8, note 9, "commitments and contingencies," in the notes to consolidated financial statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations.
restructuring and other exit costs, net. our restructuring plans include one-time termination benefits as well as certain contractual termination benefits. we record costs associated with exit activities related to restructuring plans in accordance with the asc topic 420, exit or disposal obligations. liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred. the timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and may extend over a 12-month period or longer. we record restructuring liabilities in "other accrued liabilities," or "other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet.
restructuring and other exit costs, net includes employee termination costs, facility closure, accelerated depreciation of certain assets and relocation costs, and contract termination costs. one-time termination benefits are recognized as a liability at
estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees, unless employees must provide future service that is longer than the statutory requirement, in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period. for the facility-related restructuring, we recognize upon exiting all or a portion of a leased facility and meeting cease-use and other requirements. the amount of restructuring is based on the fair value of the lease obligation for the abandoned space, which includes a sublease assumption that could be reasonably obtained. we also recognize accelerated depreciation related to assets at the time we commit to a plan to abandon.
restructuring and other exit costs, net requires significant estimates and assumptions, including sub-lease income and expenses for severance and other employee separation costs. our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates. we monitor these estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances and any corresponding adjustments to the accrual are recorded in our statement of operations in the period when such changes are known.

•   we adopted asc topic 606 and asc topic 340-40 during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. see discussion below for additional information regarding certain metrics that were affected by the new standards under the heading "impact of new revenue accounting standard."
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the u.s. and international regions, including tech data corporation and its global affiliates (collectively, "tech data"). total sales to tech data accounted for 35%, 31%, and 30% of autodesk's total net revenue during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software subscription services. should any of our agreements with tech data be terminated for any reason, we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue. consequently, we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data.
subscriptions, and recurring revenue are not intended to be combined with those items. our determination and presentation may differ from that of other companies. please refer to the glossary of terms for the definitions of these metrics.
(1)   the acquisition of a business may cause variability in the comparison of recurring revenue in this table above and recurring revenue derived from the revenue reported in the consolidated statements of operations.
the following table outlines our arr, subscriptions, and arps metrics as of fiscal years ended january 31, 2019 and 2018. for purposes of clarification, the arr and arps balances in the following table as of january 31, 2019 are calculated under asc topic 606. for comparison of arr and arps as of january 31, 2019 under the old revenue standard, asc topic 605, refer to the table under the title "impact of new revenue accounting standard" further below.
(1)   the acquisition of a business may cause variability in the comparison of arr reported in this table above and arr derived from the revenue reported in the consolidated statements of operations.
(3)   there are small variances between arr and total subscriptions due in part to the inherent limitation with collecting all subscriptions information. for example, buzzsaw and constructware are included with arr but not in total subscriptions due to these inherent limitations. we do not view these variances as meaningful to amounts or quarterly comparisons presented here for arps.
subscription plan subscriptions increased 56% or approximately 1.3 million as compared to the end of fiscal 2018, driven by growth in all subscription plan types, led by new product subscriptions. subscription plan subscriptions benefited from
maintenance plan subscriptions decreased 45% or approximately 652,800 as compared to the end of fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of the strong performance of the m2s program in which approximately 452,000 maintenance plan subscriptions converted to product subscription during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2019. the net decrease is expected and we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance plan subscriptions going forward as part of the business model transition. the rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions subject to renewal, the renewal rate, and our ability to incentivize customers to switch over to ebas or product subscriptions.
our arps is currently, and will continue to be, affected by various factors including the m2s program, geography and product mix, promotions, acquisitions, sales linearity within a quarter, pricing changes, and foreign currency.
impact of new revenue accounting standard effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted accounting standard update no. 2014-09, which codified new revenue recognition guidance under asc topic 606. previously, we followed revenue accounting guidance under asc topic 605. under the modified retrospective adoption, autodesk calculated the impact of the adoption during fiscal 2019, as the first year of adoption. the table below shows what some of our key metrics would have been under asc topic 605 (see part ii, item 8, note 1, "business and summary of significant accounting policies" for more details on our adoption and impacts).

(1)   please refer to the glossary of terms for the definitions of our constant currency growth rates.
changes in the value of the u.s. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue, total spend, and income (loss) from operations in future periods. we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the u.s. dollar.
total deferred revenue the adoption of asc topic 606 required a change to the definition of unbilled deferred revenue and new qualitative and quantitative disclosures around our performance obligations. unbilled deferred revenue represents contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multi-year billing plans primarily for subscription, services and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not been recognized. under asc topic 606, unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet. see part ii, item 8, note , "revenue recognition" for more details on autodesk's performance obligations.
balance sheet and cash flow items at january 31, 2019, we had $953.6 million in cash and marketable securities. our cash flow from operations increased to $377.1 million for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2019 from $0.9 million for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2018. we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock for $292.5 million during fiscal 2019. comparatively, we repurchased 6.9 million shares of our common stock for $690.1 million during fiscal 2018. further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading "liquidity and capital resources."
results of operations the revenue and spend balances included in the tables below during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2019, are calculated under asc topic 606. for comparison of subscription revenue, maintenance revenue, other revenue and total spend during the fiscal year ended january 31, 2019, under asc topic 605, refer to the table within item 7, "overview" under the title "impact of new revenue accounting standard."
net revenue by income statement presentation subscription revenue consists of our term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business arrangements. revenue from these arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied.
maintenance revenue consists of renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license. under our maintenance plan, customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades, when and if available, and technical support. we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the agreements, which is generally one year.

we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our net revenue. unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue, including in emerging economies such as brazil, russia, india, and china, may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance. changes in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected, and could continue to significantly affect, our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue. increases to the levels of political and economic unpredictability in the global market may impact our future financial results.

cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of subscription and maintenance revenue includes the labor costs of providing product support to our subscription and maintenance customers, including allocated it and facilities costs, professional services fees related to operating our network and cloud infrastructure, royalties, depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries, related expenses of network operations, and stock-based compensation expense.
cost of other revenue includes labor costs associated with product setup, costs of consulting and training services contracts, and collaborative project management services contracts. cost of other revenue also includes stock-based compensation expense, direct material and overhead charges, allocated it and facilities costs, professional services fees and royalties. direct material and overhead charges include the cost associated with electronic and physical fulfillment.
marketing and sales expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees, the expense of travel, entertainment and training for such personnel, sales and dealer commissions, and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows and expositions, and various sales and promotional programs. marketing and sales expenses also include payment processing fees, the cost of supplies and equipment, gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges, allocated it and facilities costs, and labor costs associated with sales and order management.
research and development expenses, which are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for research and development employees, the expense of travel, entertainment and training for such personnel, professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors, gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges, and allocated it and facilities costs.
general and administrative expenses include salaries, bonuses, acquisition-related transition costs, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our ceo, finance, human resources and legal employees, as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services, certain foreign business taxes, gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges, expense of travel, entertainment and training, net it and facilities costs, and the cost of supplies and equipment.

interest and other expense, net, positively changed by $30.5 million during fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by curtailment gains on our pension plans, mark-to-market gains on certain of our privately-held strategic investments, realized gains on sales of strategic investments, offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from our term loan entered into on december 17, 2018 in aggregate principal amount of $500 million and mark-to-market losses on marketable securities.
interest expense and investment income fluctuates based on average cash, marketable securities and debt balances, average maturities and interest rates.
gains and losses on foreign currency are primarily due to the impact of re-measuring foreign currency transactions and net monetary assets into the functional currency of the corresponding entity. the amount of the gain or loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the year.
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method. deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse.
income tax expense was $38.1 million and $9.6 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, relative to pre-tax losses of $42.7 million and $557.3 million, respectively, for the same periods.  tax expense for fiscal 2019 consists primarily of foreign tax expense including withholding tax and tax amortization on indefinite-lived intangibles offset by a benefit for the release of uncertain tax positions upon finalization of irs examination during the current fiscal year. in addition, we had a tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance from acquired deferred tax liabilities during the current fiscal year. tax expense for fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of foreign tax expense including withholding tax and tax amortization on indefinite-lived intangibles offset by the revaluation of our deferred tax liability due to the corporate rate reduction under the tax act. we recorded a tax benefit of the tax act in our financial statements as of january 31, 2018 of approximately $32.3 million mainly driven by the corporate rate remeasurement of the indefinite-lived intangible deferred tax liability.
the tax act was signed into law on december 22, 2017 and provided broad and significant changes to the u.s. corporate income tax regime. in light of our fiscal year-end, the tax act reduced the statutory federal corporate rate from 35% to 33.81% for fiscal 2018 and to 21% for fiscal 2019 and forward. the tax act also, among many other provisions, imposed a one-time mandatory tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries (commonly referred to as the "transition tax"), subjected the deemed intangible income of our foreign subsidiaries to current u.s. taxation (commonly referred to as "gilti"), provided for a full dividends received deduction upon repatriation of untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, imposed a minimum taxation (without most tax credits) on modified taxable income, which is generally taxable income without deductions for payments to related foreign companies (commonly referred to as "beat"), modified the accelerated depreciation deduction rules, and made updates to the deductibility of certain expenses. we have completed our determination of the accounting implications of the tax act on our tax accruals.
as of january 31, 2018, we estimated taxable income associated with offshore earnings of $831.5 million, and as of january 31, 2019, we adjusted the taxable income to $819.6 million to reflect the impact of treasury regulations issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. transition tax related to adjustments in offshore earnings resulted in no impact to the effective tax rate as it is primarily offset by net operating losses that are subject to a full valuation allowance. as a result of the transition tax, we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $45.1 million for foreign tax credits, which are also subject to a full valuation allowance.
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered. the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income. beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we considered recent cumulative losses in the u.s. arising from our business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence. considering this negative evidence and the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the u.s. to realize the deferred tax assets, we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets and recorded a full valuation allowance. furthermore, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our singapore operation, similar to the u.s. incurred cumulative losses and recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset. as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model, tax planning strategies may become feasible whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized; as a result, we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets each quarter, both in the u.s. and in foreign jurisdictions, based on all available evidence, both positive and negative.
as of january 31, 2019, we had $209.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $190.6 million would reduce our valuation allowance, if recognized. the remaining $18.4 million would impact the effective tax rate. it is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months; however, an estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made at this time.
our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate, changes in valuation allowances, level of profit before tax, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, and changes in tax laws including impacts of the tax act. a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries. our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates.
for additional information regarding our income tax provision and reconciliation of our effective rate to the federal statutory rate of 21%, see part ii, item 8, note 5, "income taxes," in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
other financial information in addition to our results determined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") discussed above, we believe the following non-gaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance. for the fiscal years ended january 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, our gross profit, gross margin, (loss) income from operations, operating margin, net (loss) income, diluted net (loss) income per share and diluted shares used in per share calculation on a gaap and non-gaap basis were as follows (in millions except for gross margin, operating margin, and per share data):
(unaudited)
gross profit                                                                $2,283.9                $1,753.2                $1,689.1
non-gaap gross profit                                                       $2,317.0                $1,785.5                $1,743.2
for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in period-to-period comparisons, we use non-gaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis. these non-gaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. we also use non-gaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits, credits, expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. for the reasons set forth below, we believe these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management, compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the long-term performance of our core business. we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining company-wide incentive compensation.
there are limitations in using non-gaap financial measures because non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies. the non-gaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. in addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non-gaap financial measures. we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a non-gaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures. the presentation of non-gaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap. we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non-gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.

(2)   ceo transition costs include stock-based compensation of $16.4 million related to the acceleration of eligible stock awards in conjunction with the company's former ceos' transition agreements for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2018.
stock-based compensation expenses.  we exclude stock-based compensation expenses from non-gaap measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies.
amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles.  we incur amortization of acquisition-related developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well. amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods.
ceo transition costs. we exclude amounts paid to the company's former ceos upon departure under the terms of their transition agreements, including severance payments, acceleration of restricted stock units, and continued vesting of performance stock units, and legal fees incurred with the transition. also excluded from our non-gaap measures are recruiting costs related to the search for a new ceo. these costs represent non-recurring expenses and are not indicative of our ongoing operating expenses. we further believe that excluding the ceo transition costs from our non-gaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for period-over-period comparability.
goodwill impairment.  this is a non-cash charge to write-down goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired. as explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.
restructuring and other exit costs, net.  these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions. in connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated, the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts. we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results. we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses.
acquisition related costs. we exclude certain acquisition related costs, including due diligence costs, professional fees in connection with an acquisition, certain financing costs, and certain integration related expenses.  these expenses are unpredictable, and dependent on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired business, or our company.  in addition, the size and complexity of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition related costs, may not be indicative of such future costs.  we believe excluding acquisition related costs facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the company's historical operating results and to other companies in our industry.
(gain) loss on strategic investments and dispositions. we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments and dispositions from our non-gaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments and dispositions in assessing our financial results. included in these amounts are non-cash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components, dividends received, realized gains and losses on the sales or losses on the impairment of these investments and dispositions. we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments and dispositions which do not occur regularly.
discrete tax items. we exclude the gaap tax provision, including discrete items, from the non-gaap measure of net (loss) income, and include a non-gaap tax provision based upon the projected annual non-gaap effective tax rate. discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year, unusual or infrequently occurring items, or the tax impact of certain stock-based compensation. examples of discrete tax items include, but are not limited to, certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years, certain costs related to business combinations, certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law. management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations. we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance.
establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets.  this is a non-cash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. as explained above, management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.
income tax effects on the difference between gaap and non-gaap costs and expenses. the income tax effects that are excluded from the non-gaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and non-gaap expenses, primarily due to stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges and other exit costs (benefits) for gaap and non-gaap measures.
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash is from the sale of our software and related services. our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs. in addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and invest in our growth initiatives, which include acquisitions of products, technology and businesses. see further discussion of these items below.
at january 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $953.6 million and net accounts receivable of $474.3 million.
on december 17, 2018, autodesk entered into a new credit agreement (the "credit agreement") for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million, with an option to request increases in the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $350.0 million. the credit agreement replaced and terminated our $400.0 million amended and restated credit agreement. the maturity date on the line of credit facility is december 2023. at january 31, 2019, autodesk had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit. as of march 25, 2019, we have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. see part ii, item 8, note 8, "borrowing arrangements," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our covenant requirements. if we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants, we will not be able to draw on our credit facility.
on december 17, 2018, we also entered into a term loan agreement (the "term loan agreement") which provided for a delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million. on december 19, 2018, we borrowed a $500.0 million term loan under the term loan agreement in connection with the acquisition of plangrid. see part ii, item 8,
note 8, "borrowing arrangements," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the term loan agreement terms and part ii, item 8, note 6, "acquisitions" for further discussion on the plangrid acquisition.
in addition to the term loan, as of january 31, 2019, we have $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding. see part ii, item 8, note 8, "borrowing arrangements," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally. our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates. in addition, citibank n.a., an affiliate of citigroup, is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our $650.0 million line of credit.
long-term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: repayment of debt; common stock repurchases; the acquisition of businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to our business; and capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal-use software applications.
our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with substantial amounts held outside of the united states. as of january 31, 2019, approximately 52% of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs. there are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances, such as foreign exchange restrictions, foreign regulatory restrictions or adverse tax costs. the tax act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and generally eliminates u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions in future periods. as a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the u.s. with little to no incremental u.s. taxes. we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed. we expect to meet our liquidity needs through a combination of current cash balances, ongoing cash flows, and external borrowings.
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled "risk factors." however, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.
our revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy. see part ii, item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for further discussion.
net cash provided by operating activities                $377.1                  $0.9                $169.7
net cash (used in) provided by investing activities      (710.4    )            506.4                 272.0
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities       151.9                (656.6    )           (578.3    )
net cash provided by operating activities of $377.1 million for fiscal 2019 consisted of $371.8 million of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, net, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, offsetting our net loss of $80.8 million, and included $86.1 million of cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities.
the primary working capital source of cash was an increase in deferred revenue from $1,955.1 million as of january 31, 2018, to $2,091.4 million as of january 31, 2019. the primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities.
net cash used in investing activities was $710.4 million for fiscal 2019 and was primarily due to acquisitions, net of cash acquired and purchases of marketable securities. these cash outflows were partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities.
at january 31, 2019, our short-term investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of $67.6 million and a cost basis of $62.8 million. the portfolio fair value consisted of $60.3 million of trading securities that were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan (see note 7, "deferred compensation," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion) and $7.3 million invested in other available-for-sale short-term securities.
net cash provided by financing activities was $151.9 million in fiscal 2019 and was primarily due to proceeds from debt issuance, net of discount and proceeds from issuance of stock. these cash inflows were partially offset by repurchases of our common stock and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31, 2019, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.
(1)   this table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities, certain purchase obligations as discussed below, long term deferred revenue, and amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities (see part ii, item 8, note 5, "income taxes" in the notes to consolidated financial statements).
notes consist of the notes issued in december 2012, june 2015 and june 2017. see part ii, item 8, note 8, "borrowing arrangements," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion..
operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities, net of sublease income, computer equipment and other equipment leases.
purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations relate primarily to enterprise subscription agreements, it infrastructure costs, and marketing costs.
deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. see part ii, item 8, note 7, "deferred compensation," in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan.
pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the u.s. see part ii, item 8, note 15, "retirement benefit plans," in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations.
asset retirement obligations represent the estimated costs to bring certain office buildings that we lease back to their original condition after the termination of the lease.
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above. we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months. in addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products.
we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations.
issuer purchases of equity securities autodesk's stock repurchase program provides autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time, and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders. under the share repurchase program, autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs, tender offers, or by other means. the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations, available surplus, the volume of employee stock plan activity, remaining shares available in the authorized pool, cash requirements for acquisitions, economic and market conditions, stock price and legal and regulatory requirements.
during the three and twelve months ended january 31, 2019, we repurchased 0.2 million and 2.2 million shares of our common stock, respectively. at january 31, 2019, 17.4 million shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program approved by the board of directors. this program does not have a fixed expiration date. see part ii, item 8, note 10, "stockholders' (deficit) equity," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of january 31, 2019, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k.

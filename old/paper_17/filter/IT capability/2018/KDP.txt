item 1a. risk factors risks relating to us following the dps merger combining the hot and cold businesses may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the dps merger may not be realized.
prior to the dps merger, dr pepper snapple group, inc., a delaware corporation ("dps"), and keurig green mountain, inc., a delaware corporation ("keurig") operated independently. the success of the dps merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate its hot and cold businesses.
integration of the hot and cold businesses following the dps merger is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. if we experience difficulties with the integration process as it progresses, the anticipated benefits of the dps merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. these integration matters could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period after completion of the dps merger. in addition, the actual cost savings of the dps merger could be less than anticipated.
following the completion of the dps merger, the size of our combined business is significantly larger than the size of either dps or keurig's respective businesses prior to the dps merger. our ability to successfully manage this expanded business depends, in part, upon management's ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two discrete companies, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity. there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the dps merger.
we incurred substantial expenses related to the completed dps merger and will continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the hot and cold businesses.
we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the dps merger and combining the hot and cold businesses. the substantial majority of nonrecurring expenses were comprised of transaction and regulatory costs related to the dps merger. we are also incurring transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the hot and cold businesses.
the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and our actual financial condition and results of operations following the dps merger may differ materially.
the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only; are based on various adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates; and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations for several reasons. our actual financial condition and results of operations following the completion of the integration of the businesses may not be consistent with, or evident from, these unaudited pro forma combined financial statements. in addition, the assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements may not be realized, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations. any potential decline in our financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the pro forma financial statements and our stock price.
in connection with the dps merger, we incurred significant additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense.
in connection with the dps merger, we incurred significant additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our interest expense. the amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the dps merger, and thus the demands on our cash resources, is greater than the amount of cash flows required to service dps's and maple's respective indebtedness prior to the dps merger. the increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. if we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the dps merger, or if our financial performance does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.
in addition, in assessing our credit strength, credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as our results of operations and financial position at the time. if our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, the credit agencies' perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our current or future results of operations and financial position or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. on may 11, 2018 and may 14, 2018, dps's long-term credit ratings were downgraded by moody's investors service, inc. ("moody's") and standard & poor's ("s&p"), respectively, but still maintained an investment grade rating.
moreover, in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, the repayment or refinancing of its indebtedness, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all.
risks relating to our capital structure jab, through its affiliate, is our largest stockholder and owns approximately 72% of the fully diluted shares of our common stock, and has the ability to exercise significant influence over decisions requiring our stockholders' approval.
we are controlled by jab, through its affiliate, maple holdings b.v. ("sponsor"), which owns approximately 72% of the fully diluted shares of our common stock, which gives them the ability to exercise significant influence over decisions requiring approval of our stockholders including the election of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of us or our assets.
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. also, jab and its affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete with us. jab or its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.
we meet the requirements to be a "controlled company" within the meaning of the rules of the nyse and, as a result, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance standards, which limit the presence of independent directors on our board of directors and board committees.
as discussed above, approximately 72% of the outstanding shares of our common stock are held by jab and its affiliates. as a result, we are a "controlled company" for purposes of section 303a of the nyse listed company manual and are exempt from certain governance requirements otherwise required by the nyse. under section 303a, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a "controlled company" and is exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, including requirements that (1) a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (2) compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and (3) director nominees be selected or recommended for selection by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating/corporate governance committee composed solely of independent directors. we continue to have an audit committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.
as a result of relying on the controlled company exemptions, the procedures for approving significant corporate decisions could be determined by directors who have a direct or indirect interest in such decisions, and our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of other companies that are required to comply with all of the independence rules of the nyse.
risks relating to our business we operate in intensely competitive categories.
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and continue to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences. competition is generally based upon brand recognition and perception, taste, quality, price, availability, product selection, performance and convenience. brand recognition and perception may be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs, as well as our use of social media and online ratings and reviews of its products, including our appliances. in addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brands' image will depend on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including an increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns and marketing programs. within the liquid refreshment beverage ("lrb") category, we compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources.
our two largest competitors in the lrb category are coca-cola and pepsico, each of which has a significantly higher share of the u.s. lrb category than us. we also compete in the lrb category against other large companies, including nestle, campbell and kraft heinz. these competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, changing their route to market, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. within the lrb category, we also compete with a number of smaller brands and a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers, such as refresco group. smaller companies may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. we also compete for contract manufacturing with other bottlers and manufacturers. in canada, mexico and the caribbean, we compete with many of these same international companies as well as a number of regional competitors.
our hot business competes with major international beverage and appliance companies that operate in multiple geographic areas, as well as numerous companies that are primarily local in operation. our hot business also competes against local and regional brands as well as against private label brands developed by retailers. our ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the countries in which we operate or in various local marketplaces or maintain or enhance our relationships with our partners and customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors, including as a result of increased consolidation in the food and beverage industry and a significant increase in the number of competitive pod contract manufacturers, several of whom offer what they market as more environmentally friendly pods than the current k-cup pods we manufacture.
consumers' preferences can change due to a variety of factors, including the age and ethnic demographics of the population, social trends, changes in consumer lifestyles, negative publicity, competitive product and pricing pressures, economic downturn or other factors.
for example, in the lrb industry, consumers are increasingly concerned about health and wellness, focusing on the caloric intake associated with regular csds, the use of artificial sweeteners in diet csds and the use of natural, organic or simple ingredients in lrb products. as such, the demand for csds has decreased as consumers have shifted towards ncbs, such as water, ready-to-drink coffee and teas, and sports drinks.
a key component of our growth strategy is continuing to develop, partner with or acquire products to cater to the next wave of beverage preferences, including ncbs and the growing cold brew and ready-to-drink coffee-based beverage categories.
if we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences and quickly develop new products or partner with a current or new brand partner in that category in response, our sales could suffer. developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive. we may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences, and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes, either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.
food and beverage retailers in the u.s. have been consolidating, resulting in large, sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. they are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices and more favorable trade terms. to the extent we provide concessions or trade terms that are favorable to retailers, our respective margins would be reduced. retailers also have leverage to require us to provide increased marketing and promotional expenditures, including larger, more tailored promotional and product delivery programs. if we and our partners, including bottlers, distributors and licensees, do not successfully provide appropriate marketing, product, packaging, pricing and service to these retailers, our product availability, sales and margins could suffer. in addition, certain retailers make up a significant percentage of our products' retail volume, including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors. some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands. accordingly, the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail customers, such as walmart and costco, key ecommerce retailers such as amazon.com, and grocery customers.
if we are unable to offer terms that are acceptable to our significant customers, or such customers determine that they need fewer inventories to service consumers, these customers could reduce purchases of our products or may increase purchases of products from competitors, which would harm our sales and profitability. furthermore, the loss of sales from a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
product safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.
the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products, including beverage products and our brewing systems. we have various quality, environmental, health and safety standards. a failure or perceived failure to meet our quality or safety standards or allegations of mislabeling, whether actual or perceived, could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, manufacturers, distributors or suppliers. this could result in time consuming and expensive production interruptions, recalls, market withdrawals, product liability claims, and negative publicity. it could also result in the destruction of product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time and higher-than-anticipated rates of warranty returns and other returns of goods. moreover, negative publicity also could be generated from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls.
any or all of these events may lead to a loss of consumer confidence and trust, could damage the goodwill associated with our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products and could negatively affect our business and financial performance.
costs and supply for commodities, such as raw materials and energy, may change substantially and shortages may occur.
price increases for our raw materials could exert pressure on our costs and we may not be able to effectively hedge or pass along any such increases to our customers or consumers. furthermore, any price increases passed along to our customers or consumers could reduce demand for our products. such increases could negatively affect our business and financial performance. furthermore, price decreases in commodities that we have effectively hedged could also increase our cost of goods sold for mark-to-market changes in the derivative instruments.
the principal raw materials we use in our cold business include aluminum cans and ends, glass bottles, polyethylene terephthalate ("pet") bottles and caps, paperboard packaging, sweeteners, juice, fruit, and water. these raw materials are sourced from industries characterized by a limited supply base and their cost can fluctuate substantially. under many of our supply arrangements, the price we pay for raw materials fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodities costs, such as aluminum in the case of cans, natural gas in the case of glass bottles, resin in the case of pet bottles and caps, corn in the case of sweeteners and pulp in the case of paperboard packaging.
our principal raw materials in our hot business include coffee beans and k-cup pod raw materials (including cups, filter paper and other ingredients) used in the manufacturing of our k-cup pods. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee and related coffee products. the arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the "c" price of coffee. this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase, and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. increases in the "c" coffee commodity price do increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impacts our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base "c" coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. these are known as price-to-be-fixed contracts. the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease (such as coffee rust), general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions, as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the factors described herein or a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
we also have a limited number of suppliers for certain strategic raw materials critical for the manufacture of k-cup pods and the processing of certain key ingredients in our k-cup pods, particularly for cups and filter paper. in addition, in order to ensure a continuous supply of high-quality raw materials some of our inventory purchase obligations include long-term purchase commitments for certain strategic raw materials critical for the manufacture of k-cup pods and appliances. the timing of these may not always coincide with the period in which we need the supplies to fulfill customer demand. this could lead to higher and more variable inventory levels and/or higher raw material costs for us.
if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases. changing suppliers can require long lead times. the failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, crop failure, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political instability, cybersecurity attacks and terrorism. a failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers' financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. some of these risks may be more acute where the supplier or its plant is located in riskier or less-developed countries or regions. any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance.
in addition, we use a significant amount of energy in our business, and therefore may be significantly impacted by changes in fuel costs due to the large truck fleet we operate in our distribution business and our use of third-party carriers. additionally, conversion of raw materials into our products for sale uses electricity and natural gas.
determinations in the future that a significant impairment of the value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets has occurred could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
as of december 31, 2018, we had $48,918 million of total assets, of which approximately $20,011 million were goodwill and $23,967 million were other intangible assets. intangible assets include both definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets in connection with brands, trade names, acquired technology, customer relationships, contractual arrangements and favorable leases. we conduct impairment tests on goodwill and all indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, as of october 1, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. for additional information about these intangible assets, see "critical accounting estimates - goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets" in item 7 and note 3 and note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data," in this annual report on form 10-k.
the impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets. an impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products and/or the product category; (ii) higher commodity prices; (iii) lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition; (iv) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events; and (v) changes in our discount rates, which could change due to factors such as movement in risk free interest rates, changes in general market interest rate and market beta volatility, among others. since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of intangible assets, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles will occur in the future. any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our consolidated statements of income, which could adversely affect our results of operations and increase our effective tax rate.
we expect to acquire businesses or brands to expand our product portfolio and distribution rights and may invest in new business strategies and/or joint ventures. in evaluating such endeavors, we will be required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business strategies, opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. furthermore, we may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with any of our completed acquisitions and any future acquisitions, including in connection with the integration or management of the acquired businesses or brands and may encounter unexpected difficulties and costs in integrating them into our operating and internal control structures. we may also experience delays in extending our respective internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in our financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. additionally, new ventures and investments are inherently risky and may not be successful, and we may face challenges in achieving strategic objectives and other benefits expected from such investments or ventures. any acquisitions, investments or ventures may also result in the diversion of management attention and resources from other initiatives and operations. our financial performance will depend in large part on how well we can manage and improve the performance of acquired businesses or brands and the success of our other investments and ventures. we may not achieve the strategic and financial objectives for such transactions. if we are unable to achieve such objectives, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.
net sales from our beverage concentrates segment represent sales of beverage concentrates to third-party bottling companies that we do not own. the beverage concentrates segment's operations generate a significant portion of our overall income from operations. some of these bottlers, such as pepsico, are also our competitors, or also bottle and distribute a competitor's products, such as pepsico and coca-cola affiliated bottlers. the majority of these bottlers' business comes from selling either their own products or our competitors' products. in addition, some of the products we manufacture are distributed by third parties. as independent companies, these bottlers and distributors make their own business decisions. they may have the right to determine whether, and to what extent, they produce and distribute our products, our competitors' products and their own products. they may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands. in most cases, they are able to terminate their bottling and distribution arrangements with us without cause. we may need to increase support for our brands in their territories and may not be able to pass price increases through to them. their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond their control, and their business could suffer as a result. deteriorating economic conditions could negatively impact the financial viability of third-party bottlers.
a significant percentage of the hot business' financial performance is attributable to sales of k-cup pods for use with keurig brewing systems. for the year ended december 31, 2018, revenue from k-cup pods represented approximately 43% of the hot business' consolidated net revenue. continued acceptance of keurig brewing systems and sales of k-cup pods to an increasing installed customer base will be significant factors in our hot business' growth plans. any substantial or sustained decline in the sale of keurig brewing systems, failure to continue to reduce the cost of keurig brewing systems, or substantial or sustained decline in the sales of k-cup pods could materially adversely affect our business. keurig brewing systems compete against all sellers and types of coffeemakers. if we do not succeed in continuing to reduce the costs of manufacturing keurig brewing systems or differentiating keurig brewing systems from our competitors in the coffeemaker category, based on technology, quality of products, desired brands or otherwise, or our competitors adopt their respective strategies, our competitive position may be weakened and our sales of keurig brewing systems and k-cup pods, and accordingly, our business and financial performance may be materially adversely affected.
we will continue to rely on the performance of a limited number of suppliers, manufacturers and order fulfillment companies.
a small number of companies manufacture the vast majority of our brewing systems, with a majority of the brewing systems we sell procured from one third-party brewing system manufacturer. if these manufacturers are not able to scale their manufacturing operations to match increasing consumer demand for our brewing systems at competitive costs, our overall results will be negatively affected. our reliance on third-party manufacturers also exposes us to increased risk that certain minerals and metals, known as "conflict minerals", that are contained in our brewing systems have originated from "covered countries" (as defined in section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010) but cannot be determined to be "conflict free". as a result of the passage of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, the sec adopted disclosure requirements for public companies whose products contain conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of such products. under these rules, we are required to obtain sourcing data from suppliers, perform supply chain due diligence, and file annually with the sec a specialized disclosure report on form sd covering the prior calendar year. we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the rules, including costs related to the determination of the origin, source and chain of custody of the conflict minerals used in our products and the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls.  moreover, the implementation of these compliance measures could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our sourcing requirements. there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such materials in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. we may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free. if we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to not purchase our products, which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory.
in addition, we rely on a limited number of key suppliers and distribution and fulfillment partners for material aspects of our business. as a result, we may have limited negotiation leverage with regards to these suppliers, which could negatively affect the business and financial performance of our business following the dps merger.
substantial disruption to production at our manufacturing and distribution facilities could occur.
a disruption in production at our beverage concentrates manufacturing facility, which manufactures almost all of our concentrates, or at our facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, a disruption could occur at any of our other facilities or those of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers or distributors. the disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, water scarcity, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation or supply interruption, contractual dispute, government regulation, cybersecurity attacks or terrorism. moreover, if demand increases more than we forecast, we will need to either expand our capabilities internally or acquire additional capacity. alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more than existing facilities or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.
increases in our cost of benefits in the future could reduce our profitability.
our profitability is substantially affected by costs for employee health care, pension and other retirement programs and other benefits. in recent years, these costs have increased significantly due to factors such as increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. these factors plus the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act in march 2010 will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance. although we will actively seek to control increases in costs, there can be no assurance that it will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward cost pressure could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
we may not be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or we could experience union activity including labor disputes or work stoppages.
approximately 8,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. these agreements typically expire every three to four years at various dates. we may not be able to renew our collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms or at all. this could result in labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages, which could impair our ability to manufacture and distribute our products and result in a substantial loss of sales. the terms of existing, renewed or expanded agreements could also significantly increase our costs or negatively affect our ability to increase operational efficiency.
failure to maintain strategic relationships with well-recognized brands/brand owners and private label brands could adversely impact our future growth and business.
we have entered into strategic relationships for the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of k-cup pods with well-regarded beverage companies such as dunkin' brands group, inc., smucker, tim hortons, newman's own organics, kraft heinz, peet's coffee & tea, and starbucks corporation, as well as with retailers such as costco, the kroger co. and walmart for their private label brands. as independent companies, our strategic partners make their own business decisions which may not align with our interests. if we are unable to provide an appropriate mix of incentives to our strategic partners through a combination of premium performance and service, pricing, and marketing and advertising support, or if these strategic partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and technological or other development efforts, they may take actions, including entering into agreements with competing pod contract manufacturers or vertically integrating to manufacture their own k-cup pods. increasing competition among k-cup pod manufacturers and the move to vertical integration may result in price compression, which could have an adverse effect on our gross margins. the loss of strategic partners could also adversely impact our future profitability and growth, awareness of keurig brewing systems, our ability to attract additional branded or private label parties to do business with us or our ability to attract new consumers to buy keurig brewing systems.
our agreements with our allied brands could be terminated.
approximately 90% of our 2018 packaged beverages net sales come from the manufacturing and distribution of our own brands and the manufacturing of certain private label beverages, with the remaining from the distribution of third party brands. currently, our allied brands include, but not limited to, vita coco coconut water, arizona tea, neuro drinks, high brew, evian, peet's coffee and forto coffee.
we are subject to a risk of our allied brands terminating their agreements with us, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. during 2018, both ba sports nutrition, llc ("bodyarmor") and fiji mineral water terminated their agreements with us. within each distribution agreement, we have certain protections in case the allied brands terminate their agreements, including a one-time termination payment.
we depend on key information systems to accurately and efficiently transact our business, provide information to management and prepare financial reports. we rely on third-party providers for a number of key information systems and business processing services, including hosting, collecting, storing and transmitting our primary data center and processing various benefit-related accounting and transactional services. our information systems contain proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. these systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from, among other things, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, processing errors, computer viruses, other security issues or supplier defaults. security, backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures. any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors, processing inefficiencies, security breaches, inability to use the systems or process transactions, loss of customers or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.
in addition, because we accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the payment card industry data security standard (the "pci standard"), issued by the payment card industry security standards council. the pci standard contains compliance guidelines with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data. we are not fully compliant with the pci standard and there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to operate our facilities and our customer service and sales operations in accordance with pci or other industry recommended or contractually required practices. we are in the process to be in compliance with the pci standard. however, complying with the pci standard and implementing related procedures, technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention. costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as those necessary to achieve compliance with the pci standard or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. even if we are compliant with pci standard, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches. any material interruptions or failures in our payment-related systems could negatively affect our business and financial performance.
in addition, some of our commercial partners may receive or store information provided by us or our users through their websites, including information entrusted to them by customers. if we or these third-party commercial partners fail to adopt or adhere to adequate information security practices, or fail to comply with their respective online policies, or in the event of a breach of our networks, our users' data and customer information may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.
as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve and increase, our information systems could also be penetrated or compromised by internal and external parties intent on extracting confidential information, disrupting business processes or corrupting information. these risks could arise from external parties or from acts or omissions of internal or service provider personnel. such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets, litigation, regulatory actions or investigations, remediation costs, damage to our reputation and failure to retain or attract customers following such an event, which could adversely affect our business.
our use of information technology and third party service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us.
our use of information technology and third party service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us.
we use information technology and third party service providers to support our global business processes and activities, including supporting critical business operations; communicating with our suppliers, customers and employees; maintaining financial information and effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls; engaging in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions; conducting research and development activities; meeting regulatory, legal and tax requirements; and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities. global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services to conduct our business, including a number of accounting, internal control, human resources and computing functions.
continuity of business applications and services has been, and may in the future be, disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware. our continuity of business applications and operations has been, and may in the future be, also disrupted by other cybersecurity attacks; issues with or errors in systems' maintenance or security; migration of applications to the cloud; power outages; hardware or software failures; denial of service; telecommunication failures; natural disasters; terrorist attacks; and other catastrophic occurrences. further, cybersecurity breaches of our or third party systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyberattacks, hacking, phishing attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees, customers, consumers, partners, suppliers, or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached. when risks such as these materialize, the need for us to coordinate with various third party service providers and for third party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might make it more challenging to resolve the related issues. additionally, in the event of a cybersecurity breach confidential information that we process and maintain about our employees or consumers through our ecommerce platform could be potentially exposed. if our controls, disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our third party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results, loss of intellectual property, breach of confidential information and damage to our reputation or brands.
we continue to devote focused resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, upgrading systems and networks, enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data; we are also in the process of enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment. however, security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. in addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats, we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident, and the cost and operational expense of implementing, maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly. although we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of a breach or disruption, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.
we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations.
our products are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the u.s., canada, mexico and other countries in which we conduct business. these laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, sourcing, labeling, storing, transportation, marketing, advertising, distribution and sale of our products. other laws and regulations that may impact our business relate to the environment, relations with distributors and retailers, employment, privacy, health and trade practices. our expanding international business will also expose us to economic factors, regulatory requirements, increasing competition and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. our international business are also subject to u.s. laws, regulations and policies, including anti-corruption and export laws and regulations.
violations of these laws or regulations in the manufacture, safety, sourcing, labeling, storing, transportation, advertising, distribution and sale of our products could damage our reputation and/or result in criminal, civil or administrative actions with substantial financial penalties and operational limitations. in addition, any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations, could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures or significant challenges to our ability to continue to produce and sell products that generate a significant portion of our sales and profits. for example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs. in addition, changes in legislation imposing tariffs on or restricting the importation of our products or raw materials required to make our products, restricting the sale of k-cup pods, requiring compostability of k-cup pods, limiting the ability of consumers to put k-cup pods into municipal waste or recycling streams or requiring manufacturers of k-cup pods to pay so-called responsible producer or other fees to local or other governmental entities in connection with the collection, recycling or disposition of k-cup pods could increase costs for us or, at least for some period of time, cut off a significant source of our sales and profits. regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of food products is increasing. certain federal or state regulations or laws affecting the labeling of our products, such as california's "prop 65," which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, are or could become applicable to our products.
the agreements that govern the indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and may affect our ability to operate our business.
the agreements that govern the indebtedness, including the indentures governing the $11,975 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the "notes"), the credit agreement governing the current $2,000 million term loan facility (the "term loan facility") and the $2,400 million in revolving credit facilities (the "revolving credit facilities"), contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability, including certain subsidiaries, to incur debt and our ability, including certain subsidiaries, to, among other things, have liens on our property, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, and engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions. our ability, including certain subsidiaries, to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.
we could lose key personnel or may be unable to recruit qualified personnel.
our future success depends upon the continued contributions of senior management and other key personnel and the ability to retain and motivate them. if we are unable to retain and motivate the senior management team and other key personnel sufficiently to support the projected growth and initiatives of our business, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.
fluctuations in our effective tax rate may result in volatility in our financial results.
we are subject to income taxes and non-income-based taxes in many u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. income tax expense includes a provision for uncertain tax positions. at any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. as these audits and negotiations progress, events may occur that change our expectation about how the audit will ultimately be resolved. as a result, there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates as events occur that cause a change in our provision for uncertain tax positions. in addition, our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period may be significantly impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules, tax regulations or interpretations of existing law. in addition, tax legislation may be enacted in the future, domestically or abroad, that impacts our effective tax rate. among other things, a number of countries are considering changes to their tax laws applicable to multinational corporate groups, such as the recently enacted u.s. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tcja"). some foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the tcja that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and operating results. moreover, many of the new provisions of the tcja will need to be implemented through u.s. department of treasury regulations and other guidance that could impact the interpretation and effect of these provisions. changes in tax laws, regulations, related interpretations, and tax accounting standards in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our financial results.
while our operations are predominately in the u.s., we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in the mexican peso, the canadian dollar as well as other foreign currencies in which we transact business. we may continue to hedge a small portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by utilizing derivative instruments for certain transactions. however, we are not protected against most foreign currency fluctuations.
as a result, our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. moreover, any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit, gross margin and income from operations from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year.
we possess intellectual property that is important to our business. this intellectual property includes ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. we and third parties, including competitors, could come into conflict over intellectual property rights. litigation could disrupt our business, divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend against claims. we cannot be certain that the steps it takes to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights. if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our brands, products and business could be harmed.
in some cases, we license rights to distribute third-party products. the licensor may be able to terminate the license arrangement upon an agreed period of notice, in some cases without payment to us of any termination fee. the termination of any material license arrangement could adversely affect our business and financial performance.
litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.
from time to time we may be a party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings that may include employment, tort, real estate, antitrust, environmental, intellectual property, commercial, securities, false advertising, product labeling, consumer protection and other claims. from time to time we may be a defendant in class action litigation, including litigation regarding employment practices, product labeling, including under california's "proposition 65," public statements and disclosures under securities laws, antitrust, advertising, consumer protection and wage and hour laws. plaintiffs in class action litigation may seek to recover amounts that are large and may be indeterminable for some period of time. we evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. we will establish a reserve as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies. we will base our assessments, estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment. actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates. costs to defend litigation claims and legal proceedings and the cost and any required actions arising out of actual settlements, judgments or resolutions of these claims and legal proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance. any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal proceedings may also adversely affect our reputation, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.
our financial results may be negatively impacted by recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions.
changes in economic and financial conditions in the u.s., canada, mexico, the caribbean or other geographies where we do business may negatively impact consumer confidence and consumer spending, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume and/or switching to lower price offerings. we may be impacted by consumer price sensitivity associated with many of our products. similarly, disruptions in financial and credit markets worldwide may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with customers, suppliers and creditors. these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials. additionally, these disruptions could have a negative effect on our ability to raise capital through the issuance of unsecured commercial paper or senior notes.
we also face counterparty risk for our cash investments and derivative instruments. declines in the securities and credit markets could also affect our marketable securities and pension fund, which in turn could increase funding requirements.
our facilities and operations may require substantial investment and upgrading.
we have programs of investment and upgrading in our manufacturing, distribution and other facilities. we may continue to incur significant costs to upgrade or keep up-to-date various facilities and equipment or restructure our operations, including closing existing facilities or opening new ones. if our investment and restructuring costs are higher than anticipated or our business does not develop as anticipated to appropriately utilize new or upgraded facilities, our costs and financial performance could be negatively affected.
due to the seasonality of many of our products and other factors, our operating results are subject to fluctuations.
historically, we have experienced increased sales of the keurig brewing systems in our fourth quarter (generally october through december) due to the holiday season. if sales of keurig brewing systems during the holiday season do not meet expectations, sales of our k-cup pods throughout the remainder of the year will be negatively impacted. the impact on sales volume and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business. in addition, our operating results can be impacted by seasonal fluctuation. as a result, our quarterly operating results are subject to these same seasonality factors.
failure to comply with applicable transfer pricing and similar regulations could harm our business and financial results.
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could audit our transfer pricing and related practices and assert that additional taxes are owed.
in the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to our positions, we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of u.s. foreign tax credits. because the laws and regulations governing u.s. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment, we cannot be sure that we will in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future.
weather, natural disasters, climate change legislation and the availability of water could adversely affect our business.
unseasonable or unusual weather, natural disasters or long-term climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of raw materials, energy and fuel, our ability to produce and demand for our products. unusually cool weather during the summer months or unusually warm weather during the winter months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance.
there is growing political and scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns ("global warming"). concern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas ("ghg") emissions. for example, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on ghg emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the countries in which we will operate. laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our production, distribution, packaging (including k-cup pods and the disposal of k-cup pods), cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water could all negatively impact our business and financial results.
we also may be faced with water availability risks. water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products. climate change may cause water scarcity and a deterioration of water quality in areas where we maintain operations. the competition for water among domestic, agricultural and manufacturing users is increasing in the countries where we operate, and as water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. even where water is widely available, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain our operations.
we are also faced with the impact of decreased or shifting agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns which may limit availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as coffee and tea, which are important sources of ingredients for our products.
we rely on independent certification for a number of products. loss of certification within our supply chain or as related to manufacturing processes could harm our business.
we rely on independent certification, such as certifications of products as "organic" or "responsibly sourced," to differentiate some products from others. we must comply with the requirements of independent organizations or certification authorities in order to label our products as certified. the loss of any independent certifications could adversely affect our marketplace position, which could harm our business.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including the factors described under "risk factors" within item 1a and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, including documents incorporated by reference.
references in the following discussion to "we", "our", "kdp" or "the company" refer to keurig dr pepper inc. and all entities included in our audited consolidated financial statements.
this annual report on form 10-k contains the names of some of our owned or licensed trademarks, trade names and service marks, which we refer to as our brands. all of the product names included in this annual report on form 10-k are either our registered trademarks or those of our licensors.
dr pepper snapple group, inc. merger on january 29, 2018, dps entered into a merger agreement by and among dps, maple and merger sub, whereby merger sub would be merged with and into maple, with maple surviving the dps merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of dps. the dps merger was consummated on july 9, 2018, at which time dps changed its name to "keurig dr pepper inc.".
maple owns keurig, a leader in specialty coffee and innovative single-serve brewing systems. the combined businesses created kdp, a new beverage company of scale with a portfolio of iconic consumer brands and expanded distribution capability to reach virtually every point-of-sale in north america.
see note 1 and note 3 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information related to the dps merger.
overview kdp is a leading beverage company in north america, with a diverse portfolio of flavored (non-cola) csds, ncbs, including ready-to-drink teas and coffee, juices, juice drinks, water and mixers, and specialty coffee, and is a leading producer of innovative single-serve brewing systems. with a wide range of hot and cold beverages that meet virtually any consumer need, kdp key brands include keurig, dr pepper, canada dry, snapple, bai, mott's, core, green mountain and the original donut shop. kdp has some of the most recognized beverage brands in north america, with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers. kdp offers more than 125 owned, licensed and partner brands, including the top ten best-selling coffee brands and dr pepper as a leading flavored csd in the u.s. according to iri, available nearly everywhere people shop and consume beverages.
kdp operates as an integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor. we believe our integrated business model strengthens our route-to-market and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our dsd system and our wd delivery system. kdp markets and sells its products to retailers, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, club stores, pure-play e-commerce retailers, and office superstores; to restaurants, hotel chains, office product and coffee distributors, and partner brand owners; and directly to consumers through its websites. our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage.
uncertainties and trends affecting our business we believe the north american beverage market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties. some of these items, such as increased health consciousness and changes in consumer preferences and economic factors, have previously created category headwinds for a number of our products. refer to item 1a, "risk factors", of this annual report on form 10-k for information about risks and uncertainties facing us.
we expect adjusted diluted eps growth for the year ending december 31, 2019 in the range of 15% to 17%, or $1.20 to $1.22, in line with our long-term merger target. supporting this guidance are the following expectations:
•   net sales growth of approximately 2%, consistent with our long-term merger target of 2-3%, despite the impact of the changes in partner brands in the packaged beverage segment.
•   merger synergies of $200 million for the year ending december 31, 2019, consistent with our long-term merger target for $200 million per year over the 2019-2021 period.
•   other (income) expense, net is expected to be approximately $30 million of expense for the year ending december 31, 2019 and assumes no gains related to changes in our packaged beverages partner brands, such as the impacts during the year ended december 31, 2018 from bodyarmor and core nutrition, llc ("core"), which recorded gains of $24 million and $12 million, respectively.
•   adjusted interest expense is expected to be in the range of $570 million - $590 million, reflecting ongoing deleveraging and the continued benefit of unwinding swaps.
seasonality the beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. our cold beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months, while hot beverage sales are generally higher during the cooler months. overall beverage sales can be influenced by the timing of holidays and weather fluctuations.
beverage concentrates sales volume in our beverage concentrates segment, we measure our sales volume as concentrate case sales. the unit of measurement for concentrate case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage, the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings.
concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors. a concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage. it does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate. our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases.
packaged beverages and latin america beverages sales volume in our packaged beverages and latin america beverages segments, we measure volume as case sales to customers. a case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us. case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to and/or distributed by us.
comparable results of operations as a result of the recent dps merger, in order for management to discuss our results on a comparable basis, we prepared unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information to illustrate the estimated effects of the dps merger, which was consummated on july 9, 2018, based on the historical results of operations of dps and maple. see supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information section at the end of management's discussion and analysis for further information on the assumptions used in the preparation of the financial information.
furthermore, management believes that there are certain non-gaap financial measures that allow management to evaluate our results, trends and ongoing performance on a comparable basis. in order to derive the adjusted financial information, we adjust certain financial statement captions and metrics prepared on a pro forma basis for certain items affecting comparability. see non-gaap financial measures for further information on the certain items affecting comparability used in the preparation of the financial information. these items are referred to within the adjusted pro forma results of operations section, which is located at the end of management's discussion and analysis discussion, as adjusted pro forma net sales, adjusted pro forma income from operations, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma diluted eps.
net income attributable to kdp decreased $261 million to $586 million, or $0.53 per diluted eps, compared to $847 million, or $1.07 per diluted eps, driven primarily by the unfavorable comparison of the income tax benefits related to the tcja in 2017 and the higher interest expense, transaction costs and restructuring and integration charges associated with the dps merger, partially offset by the incremental income from operations impact of the dps merger.
•   in late october 2018, we entered into a long-term distribution agreement with danone waters of america to sell, distribute and merchandise evian, the leading global brand of premium natural spring water, across the u.s.
•   on november 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of core, a rapidly-growing brand that participates in the premium enhanced water segment.
results of operations as our financial information prior to the keurig acquisition is not comparable to the financial information subsequent to the keurig acquisition, predecessor and successor periods are presented to indicate the application of the different bases of accounting between the periods presented. as a result and when combined with the change in year-end for maple as of december 31, 2017, we have provided our results of operations for individual periods that are also not comparable. see note 1 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.
•   three months ended december 31, 2017 ("transition 2017"),
additionally, the predecessor period of september 27, 2015 through march 2, 2016 ("predecessor 2016") is included and only reflects keurig activity within the period.
predecessor 2016, combined with 2018, transition 2017, fiscal 2017 and successor 2016, collectively, are defined herein as the "periods".
we eliminate from our financial results all intercompany transactions between entities included in our consolidated financial statements and the intercompany transactions with our equity method investees.

(1)   the calendar year ended december 31, 2017 was prepared in order to populate the unaudited pro forma combined financial information for calendar year ended december 31, 2017 which will then provide a comparable period to 2018. see reconciliation of calendar year statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017 for the full reconciliation of the calendar year ended december 31, 2017.
gross profit. gross profit for 2018 was $3,882 million, or 52.2% of net sales as compared to $2,025 million, or 47.9% of net sales for the calendar year ended december 31, 2017. this increase in gross profit is driven primarily by the higher margins associated with net sales as a result of the dps merger.
selling, general and administrative expenses. sg&a expenses for 2018 were $2,635 million, or 35.4% of net sales as compared to $1,163 million, or 27.5% of net sales for the calendar year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in sg&a expenses was driven by the dps merger and reflects the incremental expenses associated with the dps operations as well as the transaction costs and restructuring and integration charges associated with the dps merger.
interest expense. interest expense during 2018 was $401 million, or 5.4% of net sales, due primarily to the increased borrowings and assumption of the existing senior unsecured notes as a result of the dps merger, partially offset by the realized gains associated with the termination of receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps during the fourth quarter of 2018.
interest expense - related party. interest expense - related party during 2018 was $51 million, or 0.7% of net sales. these related party loans were capitalized into additional paid in capital at the time of the dps merger and no longer incur any future interest expense.
other (income) expense, net. other (income) expense, net in 2018 was a benefit of $19 million, primarily due to the distribution from bodyarmor, which resulted in a gain of approximately $24 million, compared to expense of $95 million during the calendar year ended december 31, 2017, primarily due to the termination of our cross currency swap on euro denominated debt during the period.
effective tax rate. the effective tax rate for 2018 and the calendar year ended december 31, 2017 was 25.5% and (64.2)%, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes included an income tax benefit of $484 million driven by the impact of the tcja. see note 6 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.
results of operations by segment the following tables set forth net sales and income from operations for our segments for 2018, as well as the other amounts necessary to reconcile our total segment results to our consolidated results presented in accordance with u.s. gaap:

sales volume. the following table details the sales volume mix by product type within our packaged beverages segment for 2018:
sales volume. the following table details the sales volume mix by product type within our latin america beverages segment for 2018:
income from operations.  income from operations was $1,163 million for 2018, compared to $1,039 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily reflecting strong productivity that more than offset inflation in input costs and logistics as well as the absence of the 53rd week of operations in 2018.

•   unfavorable rate, primarily driven by strategic price alignment and increased trade spend with our pod business partners, which decreased net sales by 5%;
gross profit. gross profit for transition 2017 was $527 million, or 45.0% of net sales (gross margin), a decrease of 3.5% as compared to $546 million, or 45.0% of net sales (gross margin), in the same fiscal period in 2016. the following significant drivers impacted the gross margin for transition 2017 compared to the same fiscal period in 2016:
•   approximately 340 basis points improvement driven primarily by ongoing pod and brewer productivity improvements.
selling, general and administrative expenses. sg&a expenses increased 5.7% to $298 million in transition 2017 from $282 million in the same fiscal period in 2016. as a percentage of net sales, sg&a expenses increased to 25.5% in transition 2017 compared to 23.2% in the same fiscal period in 2016. the 5.7% increase was primarily attributable to a 38%, or $14 million, increase in planned advertising and promotional spending primarily associated with television media campaigns aimed at driving household penetration of the keurig single-serve system.
income from operations. income from operations in transition 2017 was $229 million, a decrease of $35 million as compared to $264 million in the same fiscal period in 2016.
interest expense. interest expense was $10 million in transition 2017 as compared to $25 million in the same fiscal period in 2016. the $15 million decrease in interest expense was primarily due to mark-to-market gains from interest rate swaps that economically hedge our variable interest rate exposure.
loss on extinguishment of debt. we realized $5 million in losses related to the extinguishment of debt from voluntary prepayments of our long term debt in transition 2017 as compared to $31 million in losses related to the extinguishment of debt in the same fiscal period in 2016.

gross profit. gross profit for fiscal 2017 was $2,044 million, or 47.9% of net sales. our gross profit was positively impacted by ongoing pod and brewer productivity programs, the discontinuation of the keurig kold product line, product mix primarily associated with selling fewer keurig k2.0 brewing systems versus keurig 1.0 brewing systems and negatively impacted by an increase in other manufacturing costs.
interest expense and interest expense-related party. for fiscal 2017, third party interest expense was $101 million and related party interest expense was $100 million for a total interest expense of $201 million. the change in interest expenses was primarily attributable to incurring a full year of interest expense on the outstanding debt obtained in march 2016 in connection with the keurig acquisition partially offset by mark to market activity on interest rate swaps, as well as the outstanding term loans with two related parties, the sponsor and mondelēz, with a combined principal balance of approximately $1,815 million which bear an interest rate of 5.5% and mature in 2023.
effective tax rate. for fiscal 2017, income tax expense was $184 million, or 32.5% of income before income tax. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was primarily impacted by a 35.0% u.s. federal statutory rate, and the net tax benefits of tax credits generated from current year foreign earnings recognized in the u.s., section 199 deductions, foreign tax rate differential, partially offset by u.s. taxation of foreign earnings, state taxes, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, and uncertain tax positions.

gross profit. gross profit for successor 2016 was $1,073 million, or 46.8% of net sales. our gross profit was positively impacted by ongoing pod and brewer productivity initiatives and other manufacturing costs improvements, lower obsolescence expense and the accounting treatment of logistics costs following the keurig acquisition.
sg&a expenses. sg&a expenses for successor 2016 were $680 million, or 29.7% of net sales. our sg&a expenses included keurig acquisition transaction costs of $102 million, which were offset by lower r&d costs and advertising and promotional spending.
interest expense. third party interest expense was $163 million and related party interest expense was $60 million for a total interest expense of $223 million. our interest expense was primarily attributable to an increase in our outstanding debt balance associated with the keurig acquisition and an increase in related party interest.

liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by all risk factors discussed in item 1a, "risk factors" that could have a material effect on production, delivery and consumption of our products in the u.s., mexico and the caribbean or canada, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume. similarly, disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. these disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials.
we believe that the following events, trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity:
•   our intention to drive significant cash flow generation to enable rapid deleveraging within two to three years from the dps merger;
•   our ability to issue unsecured commercial paper notes ("commercial paper") on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $2,400 million;
•   our continued capital expenditures;
•   seasonality of our operating cash flows, which includes our payable extension program and structured payables, which could impact short-term liquidity;
•   future equity investments; and
•   future mergers or acquisitions of brand ownership companies, regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage.
financing arrangements refer to note 8 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for management's discussion of financing arrangements.
liquidity based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months. to the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize cash on hand or amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary.

amounts excluded from our table as of december 31, 2018, we had $62 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, related interest and penalties classified as a long-term liability. the table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment. refer to note 6 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for further information.
the total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december 31, 2018 was approximately $30 million. this amount is impacted by, among other items, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets. we did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above.the pension protection act of 2006 was enacted in august 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of u.s. defined benefit pension plans. we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. we did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above.
we have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other non-current liabilities. we did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control.
in general, we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims. our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs is estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. as of december 31, 2018, our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs totaled approximately $94 million.
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results and require difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments. these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. the most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary. we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates. we have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates. we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates. however, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. see note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies.

for both goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of either the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is not "more likely than not" less than its carrying value ("step 0").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt, adjusted with various risk premiums. for 2018, such discount rates ranged from 8.5% to 9.5%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      for purposes of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in the dps merger, we performed a step 0 test, concluding no further analysis was required.
if a quantitative analysis is required, the following would be required:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                long term growth rates are based on the long-term inflation forecast, industry growth and the long-term economic growth potential. for 2018, the long term growth rates ranged from 0.9% to 2.4%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 for the goodwill within the coffee systems segment, holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant, including the revenue and profit performance assumption, the effect of a 0.50% increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units as of october 1, 2018 would not change our conclusion.
- the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recorded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           royalty rates are based on observable market participant information. for 2018, such royalty rate used in the impairment analysis of trade names ranged from 6.0% to 7.0%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        for the trade names within the coffee systems segment, holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant, including the revenue and profit performance assumption, the effect of a 0.50% increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our brands as of october 1, 2018 would impact the amount of headroom over the carrying value of our trade names as follows (in millions):
- the impairment tests for goodwill include comparing a fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges.

accruals for customer incentives, sales returns and marketing programs are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms, volume-based metrics and/or historical trends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            further judgment is required to ensure the classification of the spend is correctly recorded as either a reduction from gross sales or advertising and marketing expense, which is a component of our sg&amp;a expenses.
income taxes we establish income tax liabilities to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not "more likely than not" to be sustained, (2) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is "more likely than not" to be sustained , but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.             our liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. as these audits progress, events may occur that cause us to change our liability for uncertain tax positions.
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets. valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    we base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets primarily on historical earnings, our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.                                                                                                                                                                the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. the fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, if applicable.   if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, as discussed in the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets critical accounting estimate section.
off-balance sheet arrangements we currently participate in three multi-employer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan, and u.s. gaap would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multi-employer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable. refer to note 7 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our multi-employer pension plans.
there are no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding. refer to note 8 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit.
effect of recent accounting pronouncements refer to note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and recently adopted provisions of u.s. gaap.
supplemental unaudited pro forma combined financial information and non-gaap financial measures supplemental unaudited pro forma combined financial information the following unaudited pro forma combined financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the dps merger, which was consummated on july 9, 2018, based on the historical results of operations of kdp (maple) and dps and reflects the change in year-end for maple. see notes 1 and 3 of our notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the dps merger.
the following unaudited pro forma combined statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 are based on the historical financial statements of kdp (maple) and dps after giving effect to the dps merger, related equity investments, and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to these unaudited pro forma combined statements of income. the kdp (maple) statement of income information for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 were derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. see reconciliation of calendar year statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017 for further information.
the dps statement of income information for the year ended december 31, 2017 was derived from its audited consolidated financial statements included in its annual report on form 10-k dated february 14, 2018. the unaudited pro forma combined statements of income are presented as if the dps merger had been consummated on december 31, 2016, and combine the historical results of kdp (maple) and dps.
the unaudited pro forma combined statements of income set forth below primarily give effect to the following assumptions and adjustments:
•   application of the acquisition method of accounting;
•   the issuance of maple common stock to jab in connection with the equity investments;
•   the conversion of maple parent corporation into kdp shares in accordance with the merger agreement;
the unaudited pro forma combined financial information was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the completion of the acquisition. we utilized estimated fair values at the merger date for the preliminary allocation of consideration to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. during the measurement period, we will continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair value of net assets acquired, which may differ materially from these preliminary estimates.
the unaudited pro forma combined financial information has been prepared and presented in a form consistent with sec regulation s-x article 11 and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been realized had the transactions been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they meant to be indicative of our anticipated combined future results. in addition, the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of income do not reflect any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, cost savings or any integration costs that may result from the dps merger.
the historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma combined statements of income to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the dps merger, (2) factually supportable and (3) are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of kdp. as a result, under sec regulation s-x article 11, certain expenses such as transaction costs and costs associated with the impact of the step-up of inventory related to the dps merger are eliminated from pro forma results in all periods presented. in contrast, under the u.s. gaap presentation in note 3, acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, these expenses are required to be included in prior year pro forma results. see note 3 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the unaudited pro forma combined financial information, including the related notes, should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of dps, and with our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
reconciliation of unaudited calendar year statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017
the following table provides a reconciliation of our results of operations under u.s. gaap for the calendar year ended december 31, 2017 in order to prepare the unaudited pro forma combined financial information for calendar year ended december 31, 2017 to provide a comparable period to 2018. the calendar year ended december 31, 2017 was prepared to reflect the change in year-end for maple assumption for the unaudited pro forma combined financial information. refer to note 1 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the change in fiscal year-end.

(in millions)                                pro forma           items affecting comparability             adjusted pro forma for the year ended december 31, 2018
adjusted pro forma operating margin                23.8      %                 22.8      %                                  100 bps adjusted pro forma net sales. adjusted pro forma net sales increased 2.3% to $11,024 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, driven by higher underlying pro forma sales volume/mix of 3.7%, with strong performances registered across most categories, partially offset by the net unfavorable impact of 0.5% related to changes in the our allied brands portfolio during the year. also partially offsetting the growth was unfavorable net price realization of 0.8%, driven by continued moderation in strategic pod pricing investments in the coffee systems segment which more than offset higher net pricing in the balance of the portfolio. unfavorable foreign currency translation also impacted the year by 0.1%.
retail market performance, as measured by iri, remained strong for the year. our csd and enhanced flavored and premium water portfolios registered market share growth in both units and dollars, driven by strong performance of dr pepper, canada dry, core and bai. likewise, the coffee portfolio also performed well for the year, driven by single-serve k-cup pod category unit growth, combined with an increase in market share of k-cup pods we manufactured.
adjusted pro forma income from operations. adjusted pro forma income from operations increased $164 million or 6.7% to $2,620 million, compared to $2,456 million in the prior year. this performance primarily reflected the benefit of the net sales growth and strong productivity, despite inflation in input costs and logistics that were not fully offset by third quarter of 2018 pricing actions in the packaged beverages segment. also impacting the performance was the unfavorable comparison between gains of $49 million related to bai during the year ended december 31, 2017 versus the $22 million gain on big red during the year ended december 31, 2018. adjusted pro forma income from operations as a percentage of adjusted pro forma net sales grew 100 basis points to 23.8% for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to 22.8% in the prior year.
adjusted pro forma net income. adjusted pro forma net income advanced 22.8% to $1,451 million, compared to $1,182 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting the growth in adjusted pro forma income from operations and a significantly lower effective tax rate due to the tcja. additionally, adjusted pro forma net income was impacted by the non-operating benefits in 2018 of a cash distribution from bodyarmor in connection with our unit-holder interest and a gain related to the core acquisition. adjusted pro forma diluted eps increased 22.4% to $1.04 per diluted share, compared to $0.85 per diluted share in the prior year.
adjusted pro forma operating margin                64.5      %                 63.7      %                                 80 bps pro forma sales volume. the following table details the pro forma sales volume changes by product type within our beverage concentrates segment for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017:
shipment volume growth for the segment was led by canada dry, due to product innovation and continued growth in the ginger ale category, along with increases for hawaiian punch and big red, partially offset by crush and, to a lesser extent, 7up.
adjusted pro forma operating margin                13.6      %                 15.7      %                            (210) bps pro forma sales volume. the following table details the pro forma sales volume changes by product type within our packaged beverages segment for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017:
adjusted pro forma income from operations. adjusted pro forma income from operations decreased 9.8% to $688 million, compared to $763 million in the prior year period due primarily to inflation in input costs and logistics, a $49 million unfavorable comparison due primarily to the $28 million gain on the step-acquisition of bai brands and a $21 million benefit as a result of the renegotiation of a manufacturing contract acquired during the bai brands acquisition in the prior year and higher general and administrative expenses. these drivers were partially offset by the increase in adjusted pro forma net sales and productivity improvements latin america beverages the following table details our latin america beverages segment's adjusted pro forma net sales and adjusted pro forma income from operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017:
adjusted pro forma operating margin                16.2      %                 13.1      %                                 310 bps pro forma sales volume. the following table details the pro forma sales volume changes by product type within our latin america beverages segment for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2017:
adjusted pro forma income from operations. adjusted pro forma income from operations increased 28.1% to $82 million, compared to $64 million in the prior year, driven by the growth in adjusted pro forma net sales and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation in input costs and logistics.

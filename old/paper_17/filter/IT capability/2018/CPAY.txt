item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks applicable to us. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. the risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. see "note regarding forward-looking statements" in this report.
risks related to our business a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.
our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel. accordingly, our revenue is affected by fuel prices, which are subject to significant volatility. a decline in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease in our revenue from fees paid to us by merchants based on a percentage of each transaction purchase amount. we believe that in 2018, approximately 14% our consolidated revenue was directly influenced by the absolute price of fuel. changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts. a decline in retail fuel prices could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.
fuel prices are dependent on several factors, all of which are beyond our control. these factors include, among others:
•   supply and demand for oil and gas, and market expectations regarding supply and demand;
•   actions by members of opec and other major oil-producing nations;
•   political conditions in oil-producing and gas-producing nations, including insurgency, terrorism or war;
•   oil refinery capacity;
•   the prices of foreign exports;
•   the implementation of fuel efficiency standards and the adoption by our fleet customers of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency or alternative fuel sources;
•   general worldwide economic conditions; and
approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue in 2018 was derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to fuel-price spreads. fuel-price spreads equal the difference between the fuel price we charge to the fleet customer and the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant. in transactions where we derive revenue from fuel-price spreads, the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant is calculated as the merchant's wholesale cost of fuel plus a commission. the merchant's wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including, among others, the factors described above affecting fuel prices. the fuel price that we charge to our fleet customer is dependent on several factors including, among others, the fuel price paid to the fuel merchant, posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices. we experience fuel-price spread contraction when the merchant's wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers, or the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant's wholesale cost of fuel. accordingly, when fuel-price spreads contract, we generate less revenue, which could adversely affect our operating results.
if we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks of our customers, we could experience an increase in credit loss.
we are subject to the credit risk of our customers which range in size from small sole proprietorships to large publicly traded companies. we use various methods to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits, but these methods cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not always prevent us from approving customer applications that are not credit-worthy or are fraudulently completed. changes in our industry, customer demand, and, in relation to our fleet customers, movement in fuel prices may result in periodic increases to customer credit limits and spending and, as a result, could lead to increased credit losses. we may also fail to detect changes to the credit risk of customers over time. further, during a declining economic environment, we experience increased customer defaults and preference claims by bankrupt customers. if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks, our bad debt expense could be significantly higher than historic levels and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, our bad debt expense was $64.4 million and $44.9 million, or 6 bps and 7 bps of total billings, respectively.
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from program fees and charges paid by the users of our cards. any decrease in our receipt of such fees and charges, or limitations on our fees and charges, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our card programs include a variety of fees and charges associated with transactions, cards, reports, optional services and late payments. revenues for late fees and finance charges represent 6% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december 31, 2018. if the users of our cards decrease their transaction activity, or the extent to which they use optional services or pay invoices late, our revenue could be materially adversely affected. in addition, several market factors can affect the amount of our fees and charges, including the market for similar charges for competitive card products and the availability of alternative payment methods such as cash or house accounts. furthermore, regulators and congress have scrutinized the electronic payments industry's pricing, charges and other practices related to its customers. any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our products and services could materially and adversely affect our revenue. any decrease in our revenue derived from these fees and charges could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
we operate in a competitive business environment, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.
the market for our products and services is highly competitive, and competition could intensify in the future. our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. in the fleet card business, our primary competitors in north america are small regional and large independent fleet card providers, major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue their own fleet cards, and major financial services companies that provide card services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers. in the commercial payments business, we face a variety of competitors, some of which have greater financial resources, name recognition and scope and breadth of products and services. competitors in the hotel card business include travel agencies, online lodging discounters, internal corporate procurement and travel resources, and independent services companies. we also compete for customers with providers of alternative payment mechanisms, such as merchants offering house cash accounts or other forms of credit. our primary competitors in europe, australia and new zealand are independent fleet card providers, major oil companies and petroleum marketers that issue branded fleet cards, and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers. our primary competitors in latin america are independent providers of fleet cards and vouchers for food, fuel, tolls, and transportation and major oil companies and providers of card outsourcing services to major oil companies and petroleum marketers who offer commercial fleet cards.
the most significant competitive factors in our business are the breadth of product and service features, network acceptance size, customer service, account management, and price. we may experience competitive disadvantages with respect to any of these factors from time to time as potential customers prioritize or value these competitive factors differently. as a result, a specific offering of our products and service features, networks and pricing may serve as a competitive advantage with respect to one customer and a disadvantage for another based on the customers' preferences.
some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand name recognition, larger customer bases, more extensive customer relationships or greater financial and technical resources than we do. in addition, our larger competitors may also have greater resources than we do to devote to the promotion and sale of their products and services and to pursue acquisitions. many of our competitors provide additional and unrelated products and services to customers, such as treasury management, commercial lending and credit card processing. by providing these services that we do not provide, these competitors have an advantage of being able to bundle their products and services together and present them to existing customers with whom they have established relationships, sometimes at a discount. for example, in the commercial payments business, we compete with full service banks that are able to offer treasury management and commercial lending in addition to commercial payment solutions. if price competition continues to intensify, we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our customers, decrease the prices of our products and services or lose customers, each of which could adversely affect our operating results. in the fleet card business, major oil companies and petroleum marketers and large financial institutions may choose to integrate fuel-card services as a complement to their existing card products and services, as well as offer add-on complementary services. as a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changing opportunities, standards or customer requirements. to the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories, they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories.
future mergers or consolidations among competitors, or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies may present competitive challenges to our business. resulting combined entities could be at a competitive advantage if their fuel-card products and services are effectively integrated and bundled into sales packages with their widely utilized non-fuel-card-related products and services. further, competitors may reduce the fees for their services, which could increase pricing pressure within our markets.
overall, increased competition in our markets could result in intensified pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and a failure to increase, or a loss of, market share. we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against our current or future competitors, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
our fleet card business is dependent on several key strategic relationships, the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results.
we intend to seek to expand our strategic relationships with major oil companies and to establish additional relationships with other petroleum marketers. we refer to the major oil companies and petroleum marketers with whom we have strategic relationships as our "partners." we use this term in the business sense to refer to strategic business relationships formed through contracts such as card program agreements, and not in the legal sense of operating under legal partnership arrangements created pursuant to laws such as the uniform partnership act. during 2018, our top three strategic relationships with major oil companies accounted for less than 6% of our consolidated revenue. our agreements with our major oil company partners typically have initial terms of five to ten years with current remaining terms ranging from about one to eight years.
the success of our business is in part dependent on our ability to maintain these strategic relationships and enter into additional strategic relationships with major oil companies. in our relationships with these major oil companies, our services are marketed under our partners' brands. if these partners fail to maintain their brands or decrease the size of their branded networks, our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected. also, our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships or add additional strategic relationships could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
to enter into a new strategic relationship or renew an existing strategic relationship with a major oil company, we often must participate in a competitive bidding process, which may focus on a limited number of factors, including pricing. the bidding and negotiating processes generally occur over a protracted time period. the use of these processes may affect our ability to effectively compete for these relationships. our competitors may be willing to bid for these contracts on pricing or other terms that we consider uneconomical in order to win business. the loss of our existing major oil company partners or the failure to contract or delays in contracting with additional partners could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
we depend, in part, on our merchant relationships to grow our business. to grow our customer base in the closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses, we must retain and add relationships with merchants who are located in areas where our customers purchase fuel, maintenance services and lodging. if we are unable to maintain and expand these relationships, our closed loop fleet card and lodging card businesses may be adversely affected.
with respect to the closed loop networks we utilize, a portion of our growth is derived from acquiring new merchant relationships to serve our customers, new and enhanced product and service offerings, and cross-selling our products and services through existing merchant relationships. we rely on the continuing growth of our merchant relationships and our distribution channels in order to expand our customer base. there can be no guarantee that this growth will continue. similarly, our growth also will depend on our ability to retain and maintain existing merchant relationships that accept our proprietary closed-loop networks in areas where our customers purchase fuel and lodging. our contractual agreements with fuel merchants and service garages typically have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew on the same basis unless either party gives notice of termination. our agreements with lodging providers typically have initial terms of one year and automatically renew on a month-to-month basis unless either party gives notice of termination. furthermore, merchants with which we have relationships may experience bankruptcy, financial distress, or otherwise be forced to contract their operations. the loss of existing merchant relationships, failure to continue such relationships on similarly attractive economic terms, the contraction of our existing merchants' operations or the inability to acquire new merchant relationships could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and our business and operating results.
we depend on our relationships with major truck stop merchants to serve our over-the-road fuel card customers. we must maintain these relationships to effectively serve our customers that use these merchants. if we are unable to maintain these relationships, our over-the-road fuel card businesses may be adversely affected.
we have long standing relationships with major truck stop merchants to accept our over-the-road fuel cards. over-the-road customers purchase a significant proportion of their fuel at major truck stop merchants. the loss of existing major truck stop merchant relationships or failure to continue such relationships on similar terms could adversely affect our ability to serve our over-the-road fuel card customers and our business and operating results.
a decline in general economic conditions, and in particular, a decline in demand for fuel and other business related products and services would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
our operating results are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally, both in the u.s. and internationally. we generate revenue based in part on the volume of purchase transactions we process. our transaction volume is correlated with general economic conditions, particularly in the u.s., europe, russia, latin america, australia and new zealand, and the amount of business activity in economies in which we operate. downturns in these economies are generally characterized by reduced commercial activity and, consequently, reduced purchasing of fuel and other business related products and services by our customers. the commercial payments industry in general, and our commercial payment solutions business specifically, depends heavily upon the overall level of spending. unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, recession, political climate or other changes, may lead our corporate customers to reduce their spending, resulting in reduced demand for, or use of, our products and services. in addition, unfavorable changes in economic conditions, may lead our fleet card customers to demand less fuel, or lead our partners to reduce their use of our products and services. as a result, a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the u.s. or abroad could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.
further, economic conditions also may impact the ability of our customers or partners to pay for fuel or other services they have purchased and, as a result, our reserve for credit losses and write-offs of accounts receivable could increase. a weakening economy could also force some retailers and merchants to close, resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and transaction declines. in addition, demand for fuel and other business related products and services may be reduced by other factors that are beyond our control, such as the development and use of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources.
we are unable to predict the likely duration of current economic conditions in the u.s., europe, russia, latin america, australia and new zealand. as a result, weaknesses in general economic conditions or increases in interest rates in key countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and operating results.
we have expanded into new lines of business in the past and may do so in the future. if we are unable to successfully integrate these new businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
we have expanded our business to encompass new lines of business in the past. for example, we have entered into the corporate payments, stored value card, vehicle maintenance management and telematics business in the u.s. and europe, and transaction processing, fuel, food, toll and transportation card and voucher businesses in brazil and mexico. we may continue to enter into new lines of business and offer new products and services in the future. there is no guarantee that we will be successful in integrating these new lines of business into our operations. if we are unable to do so, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
if we fail to develop and implement new technology, products and services, adapt our products and services to changes in technology, the marketplace requirements, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology, products and services are not successful, we could lose customers and partners.
the markets for our products and services are highly competitive and characterized by technological change, frequent introduction of new products and services and evolving industry standards. we must respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the requirements of our customers and partners, in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position and fulfill contractual obligations. we may be unsuccessful in expanding our technological capabilities and developing, marketing or selling new products and services that meet these changing demands, which could jeopardize our competitive position. in addition, we engage in significant efforts to upgrade our products and services and the technology that supports these activities on a regular basis.
the products we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions, all at high volumes and processing speeds. any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or service or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses. we may rely on third parties to develop or co-develop our solutions or to incorporate our solutions into broader platforms for the commercial payments industry. we may not be able to enter into such relationships on attractive terms, or at all, and these relationships may not be successful. in addition, partners, some of whom may be our competitors or potential competitors, may choose to develop competing solutions on their own or with third parties. even if we are successful in developing new services and technologies, these new services and technologies may not achieve broad acceptance due to a variety of factors, including a lack of industry-wide standards, competing products and services, or resistance to these changes from our customers. in addition, we may not be able to derive revenue from these efforts.
if we are unsuccessful in completing the migration of material technology, otherwise upgrading our products and services and supporting technology or completing or gaining market acceptance of new technology, products and services, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones in the impacted business line.
our debt obligations, or our incurrence of additional debt obligations, could limit our flexibility in managing our business and could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.
at december 31, 2018, we had approximately $4.78 billion of debt outstanding under our credit facility and securitization facility. in addition, we are permitted under our credit agreement to incur additional indebtedness, subject to specified limitations. our substantial indebtedness currently outstanding, or as may be outstanding if we incur additional indebtedness, could have important consequences, including the following:
•   we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations under our debt facilities and, if we fail to satisfy these obligations, an event of default could result;
•   we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate activities. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-contractual obligations," which sets forth our payment obligations with respect to our existing long-term debt;
•   covenants relating to our debt may limit our ability to enter into certain contracts or to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate activities;
•   covenants relating to our debt may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including by restricting our ability to make strategic acquisitions;
•   we may be more vulnerable than our competitors to the impact of economic downturns and adverse developments in the industry in which we operate;
•   although we have no current intention to pay any dividends, we may be unable to pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to your investment; and
•   we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors.
the occurrence of one or more of these potential consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
in addition, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. although our credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of additional indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. if new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we will face would increase.
we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility, which we must renew every three years.
we meet a significant portion of our working capital needs through a securitization facility, pursuant to which we sell accounts receivable to a special-purpose entity that in turn sells undivided participation interests in the accounts receivable to certain purchasers, who finance their purchases through the issuance of short-term commercial paper. the securitization facility has a three year term. although we have been able to renew our securitization facility in the past, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to renew this facility in the future on terms acceptable to us. for example, the market for commercial paper experienced significant volatility during the financial crisis that began in 2008. also, a significant rise in fuel prices could cause our accounts receivable to increase beyond the capacity of the securitization facility. there can be no assurance that the size of the facility can be expanded to meet these increased working capital needs. further, we may not be able to fund such increases in accounts receivable with our available cash resources. our inability to meet working capital needs could adversely affect our financial condition and business, including our relationships with merchants, customers and partners. further, we are
exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings under the securitization facility are subject to variable rates of interest. we renewed our securitization facility as of august 30, 2018, with an expiration date of november 14, 2020.
changes in the method pursuant to which the libor rates are determined and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect our results of operations.
libor and certain other "benchmarks" are the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform.  these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.  in particular, on july 27, 2017, the united kingdom's financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021.  it is unclear whether, at that time, libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will be established. any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the performance of libor relative to its historic values.  if the methods of calculating libor change from current methods for any reason, or if libor ceases to perform as it has historically, our interest expense associated with the unhedged portion of our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we incur may increase.  further, if libor ceases to exist, we may be forced to substitute an alternative reference rate, such as a different benchmark interest rate or base rate borrowings, in lieu of libor under our current and future indebtedness and cash flow hedges.  at this point, it is not clear what, if any, alternative reference rate may be adopted to replace libor, however, any such alternative reference rate may be calculated differently than libor and may increase the interest expense associated with our existing or future indebtedness.
finally, the replacement or disappearance of libor may adversely affect the value of and return on our libor-based obligations and the availability, pricing and terms of cash flow hedges we use to hedge our variable interest rate risk. alternative reference rates or modifications to libor may not align for our assets, liabilities, and hedging instruments, which could reduce the effectiveness of certain of our interest rate hedges, and could cause increased volatility in our earnings.  we may also incur expenses to amend and adjust our indebtedness and swaps to eliminate any differences between any alternative reference rates used by our cash flow hedges and our outstanding indebtedness.
any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our borrowing costs, business and results of operations.
we are subject to risks related to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, and restrictions on our ability to utilize revenue generated in foreign currencies.
as a result of our foreign operations, we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates for revenue generated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. for the year ended december 31, 2018, approximately 39% of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (primarily, british pound, brazilian real, canadian dollar, russian ruble, mexican peso, czech koruna, euro, australian dollar and new zealand dollar). revenue and profit generated by international operations may increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income. volatility in foreign currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
furthermore, we are subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of more than a specified amount of our foreign currencies into u.s. dollars, and, as we continue to expand, we may become subject to further exchange control regulations that limit our ability to freely utilize and transfer currency in and out of particular jurisdictions. these restrictions may make it more difficult to effectively utilize the cash generated by our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.
we expect to continue our expansion through acquisitions, which may divert our management's attention and result in unexpected operating difficulties, increased costs and dilution to our stockholders. we also may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.
we have been an active business acquirer in the u.s. and internationally, and, as part of our growth strategy, we expect to seek to acquire businesses, commercial account portfolios, technologies, services and products in the future. we have substantially expanded our overall business, customer base, headcount and operations through acquisitions. the acquisition and integration of each business involves a number of risks and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures in assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired business. furthermore, acquisitions may:
•   involve our entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience;
•   involve difficulties in retaining the customers of the acquired business;
•   involve difficulties and expense associated with regulatory requirements, competition controls or investigations;
•   result in a delay or reduction of sales for both us and the business we acquire; and
•   disrupt our ongoing business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our current business.
in addition, international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including, for example:
•   difficulty managing geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;
•   difficulty integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds, languages and organizational cultures;
•   difficulty and expense introducing our corporate policies or controls;
•   increased expense to comply with foreign regulatory requirements applicable to acquisitions;
•   difficulty entering new foreign markets due to, among other things, lack of customer acceptance and a lack of business knowledge of these new markets; and
•   political, social and economic instability.
in addition, the integration process following an acquisition requires significant management attention and resources. integration of acquisitions could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies on our services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
to complete future acquisitions, we may determine that it is necessary to use a substantial amount of our cash or engage in equity or debt financing. if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future and to pursue other business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. in addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, which could limit our ability to engage in acquisitions. moreover, we can make no assurances that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, such as operating improvements or anticipated cost savings, would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unexpected liabilities in connection with any acquisition.
further, an acquisition may negatively affect our operating results because it may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges, may require the amortization, write-down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, may include substantial contingent consideration payments or other compensation that reduce our earnings during the quarter in which incurred, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset acquisition costs.
we conduct a significant portion of our business in foreign countries and we expect to expand our operations into additional foreign countries where we may be adversely affected by operational and political risks that are greater than in the u.s.
we have foreign operations in, or provide services for commercial card accounts in 82 countries throughout north america, south america, europe, africa, oceania and asia. we also expect to seek to expand our operations into various additional countries in asia, europe and latin america as part of our growth strategy.
some of the countries where we operate, and other countries where we will seek to operate, such as russia, brazil and mexico, have undergone significant political, economic and social change in recent years, and the risk of unforeseen changes in these countries may be greater than in the u.s. for example, russia and ukraine are experiencing significant unrest, which could escalate into broader armed conflict and additional economic sanctions by the u.s., united nations or other countries against russia. in addition, political discourse in the u.s. may impact business practices in mexico and other jurisdictions. in addition, changes in laws or regulations, including with respect to payment service providers, taxation, information technology, data transmission and the internet, revenues from non-u.s. operations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, whether caused by a change in government or otherwise, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
in addition, conducting and expanding our international operations subjects us to other risks that we do not generally face in the u.s. these include:
•   difficulties and increased expense introducing corporate policies and controls in our international operations;
•   increased expense related to localization of our products and services, including language translation and the creation of localized agreements;
•   potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and changes in tax rates;
•   increased expense to comply with foreign laws and legal standards, including laws that regulate pricing and promotion activities and the import and export of information technology, which can be difficult to monitor and are often subject to change;
•   increased expense to comply with u.s. laws that apply to foreign operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") and ofac regulations;
•   increased expense to comply with u.k. laws that apply to foreign operations, including the u.k. bribery act;
•   increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
•   political, social and economic instability;
•   terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and
•   reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights and cultural norms in some geographies that are simply not respectful of intellectual property rights.
in addition, in june 2016, voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union, commonly referred to as "brexit." this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the united kingdom and the european union, and this uncertainty may persist for years. a withdrawal could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the united kingdom and the european union, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in europe. the united kingdom's vote to exit the european union could also result in similar referendums or votes in other european countries in which we do business. the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the united kingdom's withdrawal and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products. any of these effects, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the occurrence of one or more of these events could negatively affect our international operations and, consequently, our operating results. further, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, international acquisitions tend to entail risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the u.s. we cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish, acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.
we are dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of interconnected computer systems, telecommunications, data centers and call centers, including technology and network systems managed by multiple third parties, which could result in our inability to prevent disruptions in our services.
our ability to provide reliable service to customers, cardholders and other network participants depends upon uninterrupted operation of our data centers and call centers as well as third-party labor and services providers. our business involves processing large numbers of transactions, the movement of large sums of money and the management of large amounts of data. we rely on the ability of our employees, contractors, suppliers, systems and processes to complete these transactions in a secure, uninterrupted and error-free manner.
our subsidiaries operate in various countries and country specific factors, such as power availability, telecommunications carrier redundancy, embargoes and regulation can adversely impact our information processing by or for our local subsidiaries.
we engage backup facilities for each of our processing centers for key systems and data. however, there could be material delays in fully activating backup facilities depending on the nature of the breakdown, security breach or catastrophic event (such as fire, explosion, flood, pandemic, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure or physical break-in). we have controls and documented measures to mitigate these risks but these mitigating controls might not reduce the duration, scope or severity of an outage in time to avoid adverse effects.
we may experience software defects, system errors, computer viruses and development delays, which could damage customer relationships, decrease our profitability and expose us to liability.
our business depends heavily on the reliability of proprietary and third-party processing systems. a system outage could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, including by damaging our reputation or exposing us to third-party liability. to successfully operate our business, we must be able to protect our processing and other systems from interruption, including from events that may be beyond our control. events that could cause system interruptions include fire, natural disaster, unauthorized entry, power loss, telecommunications failure, computer viruses, terrorist acts and war. although we have taken steps to protect against data loss and system failures, there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures.
our products and services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that are constantly evolving. we often encounter delays and cost overruns in developing changes implemented to our systems. in addition, the underlying software may contain undetected errors, viruses or defects. defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential customers, harm to our reputation or exposure to liability claims. in addition, we rely on technologies supplied to us by third parties that may also contain undetected errors, viruses or defects that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. although we attempt to limit our potential liability for warranty claims through disclaimers in our software documentation and limitation of liability provisions in our licenses and other agreements with our customers, we cannot assure that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability.
under certain circumstances, when we fund customer transactions, we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or vouchers. we do not maintain insurance to protect us against such losses. we bear similar risk relating to fraudulent acts of employees or contractors, for which we maintain insurance. however, the conditions or limits of coverage may be insufficient to protect us against such losses.
criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving financial products, such as skimming and counterfeiting payment cards and identity theft. a single significant incident of fraud, or increases in the overall level of fraud, involving our cards and other products and services, could result in reputational damage to us, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and other products and services or lead to greater regulation that would increase our compliance costs. fraudulent activity could also result in the imposition of regulatory sanctions, including significant monetary fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may not be able to adequately protect our systems or the data we collect from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks, which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation.
we electronically receive, process, store and transmit data and sensitive information about our customers and merchants, including bank account information, social security numbers, expense data, and credit card, debit card and checking account numbers. we endeavor to keep this information confidential; however, our websites, networks, information systems, services and technologies may be targeted for sabotage, disruption or misappropriation. the uninterrupted operation of our information systems and our ability to maintain the confidentiality of the customer and consumer information that resides on our systems are critical to the successful operation of our business. unauthorized access to our networks and computer systems could result in the theft or publication of confidential information or the deletion or modification of records or could otherwise cause interruptions in our service and operations.
while we have not suffered any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, we discovered unauthorized access to certain of our systems during the second quarter of 2018, which we previously disclosed. following the discovery of suspicious activity primarily on systems involving the company's gift card business, the company took prompt
action to stop the activity and limit the improper use of accessed private label gift card information (these gift cards do not contain personally identifiable information such as consumer names, social security numbers, driver's license numbers and other sensitive personal data) with the help of technology forensic firms. the company also contacted federal law enforcement and merchants known to be affected. the investigation has now been concluded and, based on the findings of the investigation, the unauthorized access was limited to what was reported in the company's quarterly report on form 10-q filed may 10, 2018, and we do not expect the unauthorized access to have a material impact on the company's results of operations. other than this unauthorized access incident, we are not aware of any material breach of our or our associated third parties' computer systems, although we and others in our industry are regularly the subject of attempts by bad actors to gain unauthorized access to these computer systems and data or to obtain, change or destroy confidential data (including personal consumer information of individuals) through a variety of means, including computer viruses, malware and phishing.
because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to our systems and the data we collect change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. threats to our systems and our associated third parties' systems can derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. computer viruses can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties. in addition, denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes, including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities. although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent disruption and misappropriation and to respond to such attacks, any inability to prevent security breaches could have a negative impact on our reputation, expose us to liability, decrease market acceptance of electronic transactions and cause our present and potential clients to choose another service provider. any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
we could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information, such as unauthorized marketing purposes and violation of data privacy laws. for example, we are subject to statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the tcpa, the can-spam act, fcc orders, state-enacted laws regulating commercial email and foreign legislation (such as the canadian anti-spam legislation and european laws enacted pursuant to european union directive 2002/58/ec and its amendments). while we believe we are in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, if we were ever found to be in violation, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to security and privacy that we impose on our service providers who have access to customer and consumer data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data. in addition, we have agreed in certain agreements to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of customer data. the costs of systems and procedures associated with such protective measures, as well as the cost of deploying additional personnel, training our employees and hiring outside experts, may increase and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability, protracted and costly litigation, governmental and card network intervention and fines, remediation costs, and with respect to misuse of personal information of our customers, lost revenue and reputational harm. while we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and such insurance may not be available for renewal on acceptable terms or at all, and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident.
in addition, under payment network rules, regulatory requirements, and related obligations, we may be responsible for the acts or failures to act of certain third parties, such as third party service providers, vendors, partners and others, which we refer to collectively as associated participants. the failure of our associated participants to safeguard cardholder data and other information in accordance with such rules, requirements and obligations could result in significant fines and sanctions and could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services. we cannot assure you that there are written agreements in place with every associated participant or that such written agreements will ensure the adequate safeguarding of such data or information or allow us to seek reimbursement from associated participants. any such unauthorized use or disclosure of data or information also could result in litigation that could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the market for our commercial payment, fleet and stored value card services is evolving and may not continue to develop or grow.
a substantial portion of our revenue is based on the volume of payment card transactions by our customers. if businesses do not continue to use, or increase their use of, credit, debit or stored value cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we believe that future growth in the use of credit, debit and stored value cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost, ease-of-use,
and quality of services offered. in order for us to consistently increase and maintain profitability, businesses must continue to use and increase the use of electronic payment methods, including credit, debit and stored value cards. moreover, if there is an adverse development in the payments industry in general, such as new legislation or regulation that makes it more difficult for customers to do business, or a well-publicized data security breach that undermines the confidence of the public in electronic payment systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our fleet card businesses rely on the acceptance and use of payment cards by businesses to purchase fuel for their vehicle fleets. if the use of fleet cards by businesses does not continue to grow, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability, businesses and partners must continue to adopt our services. similarly, growth in the acceptance and use of fleet cards will be impacted by the acceptance and use of electronic payment transactions generally.
furthermore, new technologies may displace credit, debit and/or stored value cards as payment mechanisms for purchase transactions by businesses. a decline in the acceptance and use of credit, debit and/or stored value cards, and electronic payment transactions generally, by businesses and merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. the market for our lodging cards, food vouchers and cards, transportation and toll road payments, telematics solutions and fleet maintenance management services is also evolving and those portions of our business are subject to similar risks.
if we fail to retain any of our stored value gift card customers, it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all, which will reduce our revenue.
most of our stored value gift card customers in the u.s. are national retailers. during 2018, a majority of our gift card revenue was derived from the design and purchase of gift card inventory, with the remaining portion of our 2018 gift card revenue derived primarily from processing fees. if we fail to retain any of these customers, it will be difficult to find a replacement customer on a timely basis or at all because there is a limited number of national retailers in the u.s. and nearly all of those other national retailers already have a gift card solution in place, either in-house or with one of our competitors. as such, any loss of a stored value gift card customer would reduce our revenue.
adverse weather conditions across a geographic region can cause a decline in the number and amount of payment transactions we process, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
when travel is severely curtailed across a geographic region during adverse weather conditions, the number and amount of transactions we process can be significantly diminished, particularly in our fleet business, and revenue can materially decline. for example, during parts of january 2014, severe winter weather shut down a large portion of the eastern united states. prolonged adverse weather events, especially those that impact regions in which we process a large number and amount of payment transactions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our fuel card, workforce payment solutions and gift card businesses' results are subject to seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income.
our fuel card and workforce payment solutions businesses have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in revenues and profit, which are impacted during the first and fourth quarter each year by the weather, holidays in the u.s., christmas being celebrated in russia in january, and lower business levels in brazil due to summer break and the carnival celebration. our gift card business has experienced in the past, and expects to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns. historically gift card business revenues have been strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weakest in the first and second quarters, as the retail industry has its highest level of activity during and leading up to the christmas holiday season.
our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our financial results.
our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent approximately 62% of our total assets at december 31, 2018. these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. we also expect to engage in additional acquisitions, which may result in our recognition of additional goodwill and intangible assets. under current accounting standards, we are required to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset, while goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized. on at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. if the carrying value of the asset is
determined to be impaired, it is written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could materially negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information, our competitive position could be harmed and we could be required to incur significant expenses in order to enforce our rights.
to protect our proprietary technology, we rely on copyright, trade secret, patent and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without our consent confidential information or infringe on our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police that misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the u.s. in addition, our confidentiality agreements with employees, vendors, customers and other third parties may not effectively prevent disclosure or use of proprietary technology or confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such unauthorized use or disclosure.
protecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and confidential information is expensive, difficult and not always possible. litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our confidential information, including trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. this litigation could be costly and divert management resources, either of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property and proprietary information.
we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our proprietary technology. moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, and we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. furthermore, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we may offer our products and services.
claims by others that we or our customers infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business.
third parties have in the past, and could in the future claim that our technologies and processes underlying our products and services infringe their intellectual property. in addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility, market exposure, and add new products and services, we may face a higher risk of being the target of intellectual property infringement claims asserted by third parties. we may, in the future, receive notices alleging that we have misappropriated or infringed a third party's intellectual property rights. there may be third-party intellectual property rights, including patents and pending patent applications that cover significant aspects of our technologies, processes or business methods. any claims of infringement or misappropriation by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial defense costs and could distract our management from our business, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail against such claims. some of our competitors may have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights and to defending claims that may be brought against them than we do. furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services. in addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of a third party's intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. alternatively, we might be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and might ultimately not be successful.
third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers relating to their use of our technologies or processes. any of these claims might require us to defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims, because under certain conditions we may agree to indemnify our customers from third-party claims of intellectual property infringement. if any of these claims succeed, we might be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
finally, we use open source software in connection with our technology and services. companies that incorporate open source software into their products, from time to time, face claims challenging the ownership of open source software. as a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. open source software is also provided without warranty, and may therefore include bugs, security vulnerabilities or other defects. some open source software licenses require users of such software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to their software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. while we monitor the use of open source software in our technology and services and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose
the source code to the related technology or service, such use could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our success is dependent, in part, upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.
our success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. the market for qualified individuals is competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.
changes in laws, regulations and enforcement activities may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate.
the electronic payments industry is subject to increasing regulation in the u.s. and internationally. domestic and foreign government regulations impose compliance obligations on us and restrictions on our operating activities, which can be difficult to administer because of their scope, mandates and varied requirements. we are subject to a number of government regulations, including, among others: interest rate and fee restrictions; credit access and disclosure requirements; collection and pricing regulations; compliance obligations; security and data breach requirements; identity theft avoidance programs; and anti-money laundering compliance programs. government regulations can also include licensing or registration requirements. while a large portion of these regulations focuses on individual consumer protection, legislatures continue to consider whether to include business customers within the scope of these regulations. as a result, new or expanded regulation focusing on business customers or changes in interpretation or enforcement of regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results, due to increased compliance costs and new restrictions affecting the terms under which we offer our products and services.
for example, certain of our subsidiaries are currently licensed as money transmitters on the state level by the banking departments or other state agencies. continued licensing by these states is subject to periodic examinations and ongoing satisfaction of compliance requirements regarding safety and soundness, including maintenance of certain levels of net worth, surety bonding, permissible investments in amounts sufficient to cover our outstanding payment obligations with respect to certain of our products subject to licensure, and record keeping and reporting. if our subsidiaries are unable to obtain, maintain or renew necessary licenses or comply with other relevant state regulations, they will not be able to operate as a money transmitter in those states or provide certain other services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the financial crimes enforcement network, or fincen, and must comply with applicable anti-money laundering requirements, including implementation of an effective anti-money laundering program. changes in this regulatory environment, including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government, may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business.
regulatory changes may also restrict or eliminate present and future business opportunities available to certain of our subsidiaries. for example, the durbin amendment to the dodd-frank act, which serves to limit interchange fees may restrict or otherwise impact the way our subsidiaries do business or limit their ability to charge certain fees to customers. the consumer financial protection bureau ("cfpb") is also engaged in rule making and regulation of the payments industry, in particular with respect to prepaid cards, and in october 2016, the cfpb issued a final rule amending regulations e and z to create comprehensive consumer protections for prepaid financial products. on january 25, 2018, the cfpb issued a final rule amending several aspects of its prepaid accounts rule adopted in october 2016 and delayed the overall effective date for such prepaid accounts rule to april 1, 2019. the extensive nature of these regulations and the implementation dates for this additional rulemaking may result in additional compliance obligations and expense for our business. the cfpb's focus on the protection of consumers might also extend to many of our small business customers. as a service provider to certain of our bank sponsors, we are subject to direct supervision and examination by the cfpb, in connection with certain of our products and services. cfpb rules, examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs. changing regulations or standards in the area of privacy and data protection could also adversely impact us. in addition, certain of our bank partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authority and, as a result, could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us.
our business is subject to u.s. federal anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the bsa. our business in canada is also subject to proceeds of crime (money laundering) and terrorist financing act, or the pctfa, which is a corollary to the
bsa. the bsa, among other things, requires money services businesses (such as money transmitters, issuers of money orders and official checks and providers of prepaid access) to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records. the pctfa imposes similar requirements.
many of these laws and regulations are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly. with increasing frequency, federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training, monitoring and compliance, including monitoring for possible violations of laws by our customers and people who do business with our customers while using our products. if we fail or are unable to comply with existing or changed government regulations in a timely and appropriate manner, we may be subject to injunctions, other sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties, and our reputation may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our partner banks also operate in a highly regulated industry, which recently has been the subject of extensive structural reforms that are expected to negatively affect the conduct and scope of their businesses, their ability to maintain or expand offerings of products and services, and the costs of their operations. these legislative and regulatory changes could prompt our partner banks to alter the extent or the terms of their dealings with us in ways that may have adverse consequences for our business.
in addition, recently implemented and pending changes in accounting standards (for example, changes relating to revenue recognition for customer contracts that became effective for fiscal 2018) may adversely affect our results of operations.
finally, we have endeavored to structure our businesses in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations, including those related to state occupancy taxes, value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions, payroll taxes and restrictions on repatriation of funds or transfers of revenue between jurisdictions. changes in tax laws, their interpretations or their enforcement could increase our tax liability, further limit our utilization of funds located in foreign jurisdictions and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
for more information about laws, regulations and enforcement activities that may adversely affect our products and services and the markets in which we operate, see "business- regulatory."
derivatives regulations rules adopted under the dodd-frank act by the commodity futures trading commission (the "cftc"), as well as the provisions of the european market infrastructure regulation and its technical standards, which are directly applicable in the member states of the european union, have subjected certain of the foreign exchange derivative contracts we offer to our customers as part of the cambridge global payments ("cambridge") business, to reporting, recordkeeping, and other requirements. additionally, certain foreign exchange derivatives transactions we may enter into in the future may be subject to centralized clearing requirements, or may be subject to margin requirements in the united states and european union. other jurisdictions outside the united states and the european union are considering, have implemented, or are implementing regulations similar to those described above. derivatives regulations have added costs to our business and any additional requirements, such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts, may result in additional costs or impact the way we conduct our hedging activities, as well as impact how we conduct our business within our international payments provider operations. in particular, the cftc has recently issued a proposed rule that, if adopted as proposed, would increase the likelihood that we will have to register one or more of our subsidiaries with the cftc as swap dealers. swap dealers are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework and compliance with this framework will lead to additional costs, including costs relating to regulatory capital and margin requirements, and may impact how we conduct our hedging activities and derivatives business with customers. we are currently evaluating the impact the proposed rule, if adopted, would have on our hedging activities and operations.
our compliance with these requirements has resulted, and may continue to result, in additional costs to our business and may impact our international payments provider business operations. furthermore, our failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines and other sanctions, as well as necessitate a temporary or permanent cessation to some or all of our derivative related activities. any such fines, sanctions or limitations on our business could adversely affect our operations and financial results. additionally, the regulatory regimes for derivatives in the united states and european union, such as under the dodd-frank act and the european markets in financial instruments directive known as "mifid ii," are continuing to evolve and changes to such regimes, our designation under such regimes, or the implementation of new rules under such regimes, such as future registration requirements and increased regulation of derivative contracts, may result in additional costs
to our business. other jurisdictions outside the united states and the european union are considering, have implemented, or are implementing regulations similar to those described above and these may result in greater costs to us as well.
governmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services.
governmental bodies in the u.s. and abroad have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the transfer of, and requiring safeguarding of, non-public personal information. for example, in the u.s., all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to help protect the privacy and security of consumer financial information. in connection with providing services to our clients, we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks, our sponsor bank and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer information. these arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as pci standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines. the compliance standards relate to our infrastructure, components, and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer personal information received from our customers. our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future. if we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings. in addition, our client relationships and reputation could be harmed, and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients. if more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level or internationally, our compliance costs may increase, our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security breaches may increase, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and we are subject to disparate consumer protection laws across different countries. our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.
in the u.s., the european union and in other jurisdictions around the world, we are subject to numerous and disparate consumer laws (including laws on disputed transactions) as well as regulations on ecommerce or similar legislation. if we are found to have breached any consumer, ecommerce or similar legislation in any country, we may be subject to enforcement actions that require us to change our business practices in a manner which may negatively impact revenue, as well as litigation, fines, penalties and adverse publicity that could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business in a manner that harms our financial position.
we collect personally identifiable information and other data from our customers. laws and regulations in several countries restrict certain collection, processing, storage, use, disclosure and security of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices, and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information. several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the countries of the european union and canada, have laws and regulations which are often more restrictive than those in the united states. the data privacy regime in the eu includes certain directives which, among other things, require european union member states to regulate the processing and movement of personal data, marketing and the use of cookies. each european union member state has transposed the requirements of these directives into its own national data privacy regime, and therefore the laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations, and have generally become more stringent over time.
future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of personally identifiable information or additional requirements and liability for security and data integrity could require us to modify our solutions and features, possibly in a material manner, and could limit our ability to develop new services and features. for example, the eu-wide general data protection regulation, or gdpr, which was passed by the european union parliament in the spring of 2016 and became fully effective in may 2018, replaced the data protection laws of each european union member state. the gdpr implements more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, increased requirements to erase an individual's information upon request, mandatory data breach notification requirements and new obligations on service providers. it also significantly increases penalties for non-compliance, including where we act as a service provider (e.g., data processor). if our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data or our marketing practices, fines, for example, of up to 20,000,000 euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) under the gdpr, or other liabilities, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business.
in february 2013, the european commission proposed eu-wide legislation regarding cybersecurity in the form of the proposed network and information security directive, or the nis directive. the nis directive requires eu member states to impose cybersecurity obligations-including data breach notification requirements-to operators of "essential services" and to "digital service providers." the nis directive and its implementing legislation if held to apply to us may lead to compliance obligations that require us to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business, which could increase our operating costs, and failure to comply may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines, penalties and adverse publicity.
we are also subject to various statutes, regulations, and rulings relevant to the direct email marketing and text-messaging industries, including the tcpa, the can-spam act and related fcc orders. the tcpa, as interpreted and implemented by the fcc and u.s. courts imposes significant restrictions on the use of telephone calls and text messages to residential and mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication when prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. violations of the tcpa may be enforced by the fcc or by individuals through litigation, including class actions. statutory penalties for tcpa violations range from $500 to $1,500 per violation, which has been interpreted to mean per phone call. while we have implemented processes and procedures to comply with these laws, if we or the third parties on which we rely for data fail to adhere to or successfully implement appropriate processes and procedures in response to existing or future regulations, it could result in legal and monetary liability, fines, penalties, or damage to our reputation in the marketplace, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, any changes to these laws, their interpretation, or enforcement by the government or private parties that further restrict the way we contact and communicate with our potential customers or generate leads could adversely affect our ability to attract customers and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense and results of operations.
our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local, and international taxing authorities. an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations. we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority. there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability. an unfavorable resolution, therefore, could negatively impact our financial position, operating results and cash flows in the current and/or future periods.
our acquisition documents include warranties, covenants and conditions regarding various tax matters that occurred prior to the acquisition, supported by indemnification and, in some cases, holdbacks or escrows from the sellers. the obligations of the sellers are also generally subject to various limitations. in the event of a tax claim related to a pre-acquisition tax year, we would seek to recover costs and losses from the sellers under the acquisition agreement. however, there is no assurance that any indemnification, holdback or escrow would be sufficient or that we would recover such costs or losses, which could negatively impact our financial position, operating results and cash flows in the current and/or future periods.
we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes. deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates. changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our operating results.
the recently passed tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") act could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tax act") could adversely affect our business and financial condition. the tax act significantly changed how the u.s. taxes corporations, including limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation, and the imposition or acceleration of taxation on certain foreign income, each of which may increase our tax expense. both the tax act and subsequent regulations and interpretations require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the irs, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. as additional clarification and guidance is issued regarding the tax act, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded, which may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.
various other jurisdictions including members of the organization for economic cooperation and development are considering changes to their tax laws including provisions intended to address base erosion and profit shifting by taxpayers. any tax reform adopted in these or other countries may exacerbate the risks described above.
we generate a portion of our revenue from our lodging card business, which is affected by conditions in the hotel industry generally and has a concentration of customers in the railroad and trucking industries.
our lodging card business earns revenue from customers purchasing lodging from the hotel industry and derives a significant portion of this revenue from end users in the railroad and trucking industries. therefore, we are exposed to risks affecting each of these industries. for example, unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the hotel, railroad and trucking industries generally could cause a decrease in demand for our products and services in our lodging card business, resulting in decreased revenue, or increased credit risk and related losses, resulting in increased expenses. in addition, mergers or consolidations in these industries could reduce our customer and partnership base, resulting in a smaller market for our products and services.
we contract with government entities and are subject to risks related to our governmental contracts.
in the course of our business we contract with domestic and foreign government entities, including state and local government customers, as well as federal government agencies. as a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with federal, state and local governments. the laws relating to government contracts differ from other commercial contracting laws and our government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not common among commercial contracts. in addition, we may be subject to investigation from time to time concerning our compliance with the laws and regulations relating to our government contracts. our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in suspension of these contracts or administrative or other penalties.
litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties or requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses, damage to our reputation and/or material adverse effects on our business.
we are subject to claims and a number of judicial and administrative proceedings considered normal in the course of our current and past operations, including employment-related disputes, contract disputes, intellectual property disputes, government inquiries, investigations, audits and regulatory proceedings, customer disputes and tort claims. responding to proceedings may be difficult and expensive, and we may not prevail. in some proceedings, the claimant seeks damages as well as other relief, which, if granted, would require expenditures on our part or changes in how we conduct business. there can be no certainty that we will not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently established or future financial accruals or insurance coverage, or that we will prevail with respect to such proceedings. regardless of whether we prevail or not, such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. from time to time, we have had, and expect to continue to receive, inquiries from regulatory bodies and administrative agencies relating to the operation of our business. such inquiries have resulted in, and may continue to result in, various audits, reviews and investigations, which can be time consuming and expensive. these types of inquiries, audits, reviews, and investigations could result in the institution of administrative or civil proceedings, sanctions and the payment of fines and penalties, changes in personnel, and increased review and scrutiny by customers, regulatory authorities, the media and others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. for more information about our judicial and other proceedings, see "business-legal proceedings".
we are named in a federal securities class action lawsuit and related derivative complaints, as well as a customer class action complaint; if we are unable to resolve these matters favorably, then our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
in june 2017, a shareholder filed a class action complaint in the unites states district court for the northern district of georgia against the company and certain of its officers and directors on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the company's stock between february 5, 2016 and may 2, 2017. in july 2017, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed against certain of the company's directors and officers in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia seeking recovery on behalf of the company, and on january 9, 2019, a second shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the superior court of gwinnett county, georgia. in addition, on february 1, 2019, a customer class action complaint against a subsidiary of the company was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia. see "part ii-item 3 - legal proceedings" below for additional information about these matters. we cannot at this time predict the outcome of these matters or reasonably determine the probability of a material adverse result or reasonably estimate range of potential exposure, if any, that these matters might have on us, our business, our financial condition or our results of operations, although such effects could be materially adverse. in addition, in the future, we may need to record litigation reserves with respect to
these matters. further, regardless of how these matters proceed, it could divert our management's attention and other resources away from our business.
our revenues from mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of mastercard, it could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations through our financial institution sponsors.
a significant source of our revenue comes from processing transactions through the mastercard networks. in order to offer mastercard programs to our customers, one of our subsidiaries is registered as a member service provider with mastercard through sponsorship by mastercard member banks in both the u.s. and canada. registration as a service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by member banks. if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us or determine to provide sponsorship on materially less favorable terms, we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services or we would need to become a mastercard member, either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive. even if we pursue sponsorship by alternative member banks, similar requirements and dependencies would likely still exist. in addition, mastercard routinely updates and modifies its requirements. changes in the requirements may make it significantly more expensive for us to provide these services. if we do not comply with mastercard requirements, it could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registration, which allows us to process transactions on its networks. the termination of our registration, or any changes in the payment network rules that would impair our registration, could require us to stop providing mastercard payment processing services. if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or become a member, we may no longer be able to provide such services to the affected customers, which would have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
changes in mastercard interchange fees could decrease our revenue.
a portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants, known as interchange fees, associated with transactions processed using our mastercard-branded cards. interchange fee amounts associated with our mastercard network cards are affected by a number of factors, including regulatory limits in the united states and europe and fee changes imposed by mastercard. in addition, interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry, which could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future. temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our mastercard network card transactions, could adversely affect our business and operating results.
if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, it could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
we believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to our customer relationships, and our ability to obtain partners and retain employees. the successful promotion of our brands will depend upon our marketing and public relations efforts, our ability to continue to offer high-quality products and services and our ability to successfully differentiate our services from those of our competitors. in addition, future extension of our brands to add new products or services different from our current offerings may dilute our brands, particularly if we fail to maintain our quality standards in these new areas. the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our markets become more competitive and we expand into new markets. to the extent that these activities yield increased revenues, this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur. there can be no assurance that our brand promotion activities will be successful.
failure to comply with the fcpa, anti-money laundering regulations, economic and trade sanctions regulations and similar laws and regulations associated with our international activities, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.
as we continue to expand our business internationally, we may continue to expand into certain foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by u.s., u.k. and other foreign regulations, including the fcpa, the u.k. bribery act, the 2013 brazilian clean companies act and the 2013 russian law on preventing corruption. these laws and regulations generally prohibit us, our employees, consultants and agents from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. we have implemented policies to discourage such practices; however, there can be no assurances that all of our employees, consultants and agents, including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate u.s. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies, for which we may be ultimately responsible. violations of the fcpa or similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the u.s., suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracting, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
in addition, we are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the bsa. among other things, the bsa requires money services businesses (such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access) to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records.
we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by ofac, which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. other group entities may be subject to additional foreign or local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions.
similar anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalent to ofac lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process. our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations.
violations of these laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the u.s., suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracting, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of these laws and regulations by u.s. or foreign authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws and regulations might be administered or interpreted.
global economic downturns or slower growth or declines in the money transfer, payment service, and other markets in which we operate, including downturns, declines, and difficult conditions in global financial markets and financial market disruptions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
the global economy has experienced in recent years, and may experience, downturns, volatility and disruption, and we face certain risks relating to such events, including:
•   our international payments provider business provides currency conversion and foreign exchange hedging services to our customers, exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk. in order to help mitigate these risks, we enter into derivative contracts. however, these contracts do not eliminate all of the risks related to fluctuating foreign currency rates.
•   our international payments provider business is heavily dependent on global trade. a downturn in global trade or the failure of long-term import growth rates to return to historic levels could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and our cash management strategies. additionally, as customer hedging activity in our international payments provider business generally varies with currency volatility, we have experienced and may experience in the future lower foreign exchange revenues in periods of lower currency volatility.
•   the counterparties to the derivative financial instruments that we use in our international payments provider business to reduce our exposure to various market risks, including changes in foreign exchange rates, may fail to honor their obligations, which could expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate. this includes the exposure generated when we write derivative contracts to our customers as part of our cross-currency payments business, and we typically hedge the net exposure through offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. that failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
risks associated with operations outside the u.s. and foreign currencies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we have additional foreign exchange risk and associated foreign exchange risk management requirements due to the nature of our international payments provider business. the majority of this business' revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates, which enable customers to make cross-currency payments. additionally, this business also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers. the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year. the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us.
our international payments provider business aggregates its foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including the derivative contracts described above, and hedges the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting
contracts with established financial institution counterparties. if we are unable to obtain offsetting positions, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.
we face credit, liquidity and fraud risks from our agents, consumers, businesses, and third-party processors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we are exposed to credit risk in our international payments provider business relating to: (a) derivatives written by us to our customers and (b) the extension of trade credit when transactions are paid to recipients prior to our receiving cleared funds from the sending customers. the credit risk associated with our derivative contracts increases when foreign currency exchange rates move against our customers, possibly impacting their ability to honor their obligations to deliver currency to us or to maintain appropriate collateral with us. if a customer becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, commits fraud or otherwise fails to pay us, we may be exposed to the value of an offsetting position with a financial institution counterparty for the derivatives or may bear financial risk for those receivables where we have offered trade credit.
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with banks needed to conduct our services, or fail to comply with our contract requirements, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows would be adversely affected.
in our international payments provider business, we facilitate payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, cross-currency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other organizations. increased regulation and compliance requirements are impacting these businesses by making it more costly for us to provide our services or by making it more cumbersome for businesses to do business with us. any factors that increase the cost of cross-border trade for us or our customers or that restrict, delay, or make cross-border trade more difficult or impractical, such as trade policy or higher tariffs, could negatively impact our revenues and harm our business. we may also have difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships needed to conduct our services due to banks' policies. if we are unable to maintain our current business or banking relationships or establish new relationships under terms consistent with those currently in place, our ability to continue to offer our services may be adversely impacted, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
risks related to ownership of our common stock our stock price could be volatile and our stock could decline in value.
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially as a result of many factors, some of which are beyond our control. factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:
•   results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;
•   results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;
•   changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;
•   announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, or capital commitments;
•   announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;
•   regulatory developments in the u.s. and abroad;
•   future sales of our common stock, and additions or departures of key personnel; and
•   general domestic and international economic, market and currency factors and conditions unrelated to our performance.
in addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance of individual companies. these broad market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. a securities class action suit against us could result in significant liabilities and, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of our management's attention and resources.
our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.
we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, or the exchange act. our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec. we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are and will be met. these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.
our corporate documents and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of fleetcor even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other stockholders. these provisions:
•   authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of those shares, which may be senior to our common stock, without prior stockholder approval;
•   establish advance notice requirements for nominating directors and proposing matters to be voted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and
•   prohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent.
in addition, delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and us. these provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of fleetcor. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.
we do not expect to pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.
we currently expect to retain all future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our operating results, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. in addition, we must comply with the covenants in our credit agreements in order to be able to pay cash dividends, and our ability to pay dividends generally may be further limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. in addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those described in item 1a "risk factors" appearing elsewhere in this report. all foreign currency amounts that have been converted into u.s. dollars in this discussion are based on the exchange rate as reported by oanda for the applicable periods.
general business fleetcor is a leading global provider of commercial payment solutions. we help businesses of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. we serve businesses, merchants and partners in north america, latin america, europe, and australasia. fleetcor's predecessor company was organized in the united states in 1986, and fleetcor had its initial public offering in 2010 (nyse: flt).
fleetcor has two reportable segments, north america and international. we report these two segments as they align with our senior executive organizational structure, reflect how we organize and manage our employees around the world, manage operating performance, contemplate the differing regulatory environments in north america versus other geographies, and help us isolate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our financial results.
our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor's product or another alternative method such as cash or check. our solutions are comprised of payment products, networks and associated services.
fleetcor is a global payments company primarily focused on business to business payments. we simplify the way businesses manage and pay for expenses and operate in five categories: fuel, lodging, tolls, corporate payments and gift. our products are focused on delivering a better, more efficient way to pay, through specialized products, systems, and payment and merchant networks. while the actual payment mechanisms vary from category to category, they are structured to afford control and reporting to the end user. the methods of payment generally function like a charge card, prepaid card, one-time use virtual card, and electronic rfid, etc. each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics. customers are primarily business to business, have recurring revenue models, specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high ebitda margins, and have similar selling systems, which can be leveraged in each business. additionally, we provide other payment products including fleet maintenance, employee benefits and long haul transportation-related services. our products are used in 82 countries around the world, with our primary geographies being the u.s., brazil and the united kingdom, which combined accounted for approximately 88% of our revenue in 2018.
fleetcor uses both proprietary and third-party networks to deliver our payment solutions. fleetcor owns and operates proprietary networks with well-established brands throughout the world, bringing incremental sales and loyalty to affiliated merchants. third-party networks are used to broaden payment product acceptance and use. in 2018, we processed approximately 2.9 billion transactions within these networks, of which approximately 1.4 billion were related to our gift product line.
fleetcor capitalizes on its products' specialization with sales and marketing efforts by deploying product-dedicated sales forces to target specific customer segments. we market our products directly through multiple sales channels, including field sales, telesales and digital marketing, and indirectly through our partners, which include major oil companies, leasing companies, petroleum marketers, value-added resellers (vars) and referral partners.
we believe that our size and scale, product breadth and specialization, geographic reach, proprietary networks, robust distribution capabilities and advanced technology contribute to our industry leading position.
executive overview we operate in two segments, which we refer to as our north america and international segments. our revenue is generally reported net of the cost for underlying products and services. in this report, we refer to this net revenue as "revenue". see "results of operations" for additional segment information.
results presented for 2018 reflect the impact of the company's adoption of accounting standards update 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers" ("topic 606") ("asc 606") and related cost capitalization guidance, which was adopted by the company on january 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. the adoption of topic 606 resulted in the classification of certain amounts previously classified as merchant commissions and processing expense net with revenues. as a result of the application of the modified retrospective transition method, the company's prior period results within its annual report on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q will not be restated to reflect the impact of topic 606.
the adoption of topic 606 had the impact of reducing revenues by approximately $112.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. such expenses were not reflected as a reduction of revenues in the 2017 and 2016 amounts presented. this lack of comparability should be considered in reviewing the transaction analysis and the various breakdowns of revenue by geography, product and source in this discussion and analysis.
revenues, net, by segment. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our north america and international segments generated the following revenue (in millions):
revenues, net, net income and net income per diluted share. set forth below are revenues, net, net income and net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions, except per share amounts).
adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. set forth below are adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions, except per share amounts).
adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are supplemental non-gaap financial measures of operating performance. see the heading entitled "management's use of non-gaap financial measures" for more information and a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap. we use adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance on a consistent basis.
sources of revenue transactions. in both of our segments, we derive revenue from transactions. a transaction is defined as a purchase by a customer utilizing one of our payment products at a participating merchant. the following diagram illustrates a typical transaction flow, which is representative of many, but not all, of our businesses.
illustrative transaction flow the revenue we derive from transactions is generated from both customers and merchants. customers may include commercial businesses (obtained through direct and indirect channels), as well as partners for whom we manage payment programs. merchants, who may also be customers under relevant accounting guidance, may include those merchants affiliated with our proprietary networks or those participating in the third-party networks we utilize.
from our customers and partners, we generate revenue through a variety of program fees, including transaction fees, card fees, network fees and charges. these fees may be charged as fixed amounts, costs plus a mark-up, or based on a percentage of the transaction purchase amounts, or a combination thereof. our programs include other fees and charges associated with late payments and based on customer credit risk.
from our merchants and third-party networks, we generate revenue mostly from the difference between the amount charged to a customer and the amount paid to the merchant or network for a given transaction, as well as network fees and charges in certain businesses. the amount paid to a merchant or network may be calculated as (i) the merchant's wholesale product cost plus a markup; (ii) the transaction purchase amount less a percentage discount; or (iii) the transaction purchase amount less a fixed fee per unit.
for a transaction involving the purchase of fuel where the amount paid to the merchant is calculated under the cost plus markup model, we refer to the difference between the amount charged to the customer and the amount paid to the merchant as revenue tied to fuel-price spreads. in all other cases, we refer to the difference between the amount charged to the customer and the amount paid to the merchant for a given transaction as interchange revenue.
revenue per transaction. set forth below is revenue per transaction by segment information for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. revenue per transactions by segment is affected by the mix of products and acquisitions, as well as the impact of the adoption of asc 606, which may result in revenue per transaction by product providing more meaningful data for analysis.

1 reflects the impact of the company's adoption of asc 606 and related cost capitalization guidance, which was adopted by the company on january 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. the adoption of asc 606 resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings in our consolidated balance sheet for the cumulative effect of applying the standard, which included costs incurred to obtain a contract, as well as presentation changes in our statements of income, including the classification of certain amounts previously classified as merchant commissions and processing expense net with revenues. as a result of the application of the modified retrospective transition method, the company's prior period results within its annual report on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q will not be restated to reflect the impact of asc 606. for purposes of comparability, 2017 has been recast and is reconciled to gaap in the section entitled "management's use of non-gaap financial measures", which includes certain estimates and assumptions made by the company for the impact of asc 606 on 2017 revenues, as the company did not apply a full retrospective adoption.

revenue per transaction is derived from the various revenue types as discussed above and can vary based on geography, the relevant merchant relationship, the payment product utilized and the types of products or services purchased, the mix of which would be influenced by our acquisitions, organic growth in our business, and the overall macroeconomic environment, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spread margins. revenue per transaction per customer changes as the level of services we provide to a customer increases or decreases, as macroeconomic factors change and as adjustments are made to merchant and customer rates. see "results of operations" for further discussion of transaction volumes and revenue per transaction.
•   merchant commissions-in certain of our card programs, we incur merchant commissions expense when we pay merchants with whom we have direct, contractual relationships for specific transactions where a customer purchases products or services from the merchant. in the card programs where it is paid, merchant commissions equal the difference between the price paid by us to the merchant and the merchant's wholesale cost of the underlying products or services. the adoption of asc 606 on january 1, 2018, resulted in a change in the presentation of amounts
previously classified as merchant commissions, resulting in these amounts being recorded within revenues, net in periods beginning in 2018.
•   processing-our processing expense consists of expenses related to processing transactions, servicing our customers and merchants, bad debt expense and cost of goods sold related to our hardware sales in certain businesses. effective with the adoption of asc 606 on january 1, 2018, certain third party processing expenses are netted with consolidated revenues, where the network is considered to be our customer.
•   selling-our selling expenses consist primarily of wages, benefits, sales commissions (other than merchant commissions) and related expenses for our sales, marketing and account management personnel and activities.
•   general and administrative-our general and administrative expenses include compensation and related expenses (including stock-based compensation) for our executives, finance and accounting, information technology, human resources, legal and other administrative personnel. also included are facilities expenses, third-party professional services fees, travel and entertainment expenses, and other corporate-level expenses.
•   depreciation and amortization-our depreciation expenses include depreciation of property and equipment, consisting of computer hardware and software (including proprietary software development amortization expense), card-reading equipment, furniture, fixtures, vehicles and buildings and leasehold improvements related to office space. our amortization expenses include amortization of intangible assets related to customer and vendor relationships, trade names and trademarks, software and non-compete agreements. we are amortizing intangible assets related to business acquisitions and certain private label contracts associated with the purchase of accounts receivable.
•   other operating, net-our other operating, net includes other operating expenses and income items that do not relate to our core operations or that occur infrequently.
•   investment loss-our investment results relate to our minority interest in masternaut, a provider of telematics solutions to commercial fleets in europe, which we historically accounted for using the equity method and recorded our share of earnings and losses. on september 30, 2017, we entered into an amended masternaut investment agreement that resulted in the loss of significant influence, and we began accounting for the masternaut investment by applying the cost method. also includes impairment charges related to other investments.
•   other (income) expense, net-our other (income) expense, net includes gains or losses from the sale of assets/businesses, foreign currency transaction gains or losses and other miscellaneous operating costs and revenue.
•   interest expense, net-our interest expense, net includes interest income on our cash balances and interest expense on our outstanding debt and on our securitization facility. we have historically invested our cash primarily in short-term money market funds and overnight bank deposits.
•   loss on extinguishment of debt-loss on extinguishment of debt relates to our write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facility.
•   provision for income taxes-our provision for income taxes consists primarily of corporate income taxes related to profits resulting from the sale of our products and services on a global basis.
factors and trends impacting our business we believe that the following factors and trends are important in understanding our financial performance:
•   global economic conditions-our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the economy generally, both in north america and internationally. factors affected by the economy include our transaction volumes, the credit risk of our customers and changes in tax laws across the globe. these factors affected our businesses in both our north america and international segments.
•   foreign currency changes-our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in foreign currency rates; namely, by movements of the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound, canadian dollar, czech koruna, euro, mexican peso, new zealand dollar and russian ruble, relative to the u.s. dollar. approximately 61%, 62% and 70% of our revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was derived in u.s. dollars and was not affected by foreign currency exchange rates. see "results of operations" for information related to foreign currency impact on our total revenue, net.
•   fuel prices-our fleet customers use our products and services primarily in connection with the purchase of fuel. accordingly, our revenue is affected by fuel prices, which are subject to significant volatility. a change in retail fuel prices could cause a decrease or increase in our revenue from several sources, including fees paid to us based on a percentage of each customer's total purchase. changes in the absolute price of fuel may also impact unpaid account balances and the late fees and charges based on these amounts. see "sources of revenue" above for further information related to the absolute price of fuel.
•   fuel-price spread volatility-a portion of our revenue involves transactions where we derive revenue from fuel-price spreads, which is the difference between the price charged to a fleet customer for a transaction and the price paid to the merchant for the same transaction. in these transactions, the price paid to the merchant is based on the wholesale cost of fuel. the merchant's wholesale cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including, among others, the factors described above affecting fuel prices. the fuel price that we charge to our customer is dependent on several factors including, among others, the fuel price paid to the merchant, posted retail fuel prices and competitive fuel prices. we experience fuel-price spread contraction when the merchant's wholesale cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our customers, or the fuel price we charge to our customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant's wholesale cost of fuel. the inverse of these situations produces fuel-price spread expansion. see "sources of revenue" above for further information related to fuel-price spreads.
•   acquisitions-since 2002, we have completed over 75 acquisitions of companies and commercial account portfolios. acquisitions have been an important part of our growth strategy, and it is our intention to continue to seek opportunities to increase our customer base and diversify our service offering through further strategic acquisitions. the impact of acquisitions has, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our results of operations and may make it difficult to compare our results between periods.
•   interest rates-our results of operations are affected by interest rates. we are exposed to market risk to changes in interest rates on our cash investments and debt.
•   expenses- over the long term, we expect that our general and administrative expense will decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenue increases. to support our expected revenue growth, we plan to continue to incur additional sales and marketing expense by investing in our direct marketing, third-party agents, internet marketing, telemarketing and field sales force.
•   taxes- we pay taxes in many different taxing jurisdictions, including the u.s., most u.s. states and many non-u.s. jurisdictions. the tax rates in certain non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions are higher than the u.s. tax rate. thus, our effective tax rate is impacted not only as a result of tax law changes such as the tax act, but also as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions.
acquisitions and investments during 2018, we completed an acquisition with an aggregate purchase price of $21.2 million, net of cash acquired of $11.0 million and made deferred payments of $3.8 million related to acquisitions occurring in prior years. during 2018, we made investments in other businesses of $17.0 million and payments on a seller note of $1.6 million.
during 2017, we completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $725.1 million, net of cash acquired of $96.3 million. during 2017, we made investments in other businesses of $39 million.
•   on august 9, 2017, we acquired cambridge, a leading business to business (b2b) international payments provider, for approximately $616.0 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $94.5 million and inclusive of a note payable of $23.8 million. cambridge processes b2b cross-border payments, assisting business clients in making international payments. the purpose of this acquisition is to further expand our corporate payments footprint.
•   on october 13, 2017, we completed the acquisition of cls, a small lodging tuck-in business, in the united states.
during 2016, we completed acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired of $51.3 million, which includes deferred payments made during the period related to prior acquisitions of $6.1 million.
•   in august 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of serviços e tecnologia de pagamentos s.a. ("stp") for $1.23 billion, net of cash acquired of $40.2 million. stp is an electronic toll payments company in brazil and provides cardless fuel payments at a number of shell sites throughout brazil. the purpose of this acquisition was to expand our presence in the toll market in brazil.
•   during 2016, we acquired additional fuel card portfolios in the u.s. and the united kingdom, additional shell fuel card markets in europe and travelcard in the netherlands totaling $76.7 million, net of cash acquired of $11.1 million.
•   during 2016, we made additional investments of $7.9 million related to our investment at masternaut. we also received a $9.2 million return of our investment in masternaut in 2016.
we report our results from our canadian acquisition in 2018 in our north america segment from the date of acquisition. we report our results from cambridge and cls acquired in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively, in our north america segment, from the date of acquisition. the results of operations from the fuel card business in russia acquired in the third quarter of 2017, are included within our international segment from the date of acquisition. the results of operations from the fuel card portfolio acquired in the u.s. are included within our north america segment, from the date of acquisition in 2016. the results of operations of stp, the fuel card portfolio in the united kingdom, the additional shell markets, the travelcard business in the netherlands and the small business in brazil are included within our international segment, from the date of acquisition in 2016.
asset and investment dispositions chevron portfolio in october 2018, we completed the sale of the chevron portfolio resulting in a pre-tax gain of $152.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2018. the gain on the disposal is included in other (income) expense in the consolidated statements of income. revenues generated from the chevron portfolio had historically been included in our north america segment.
telematics businesses as part of our plan to exit the telematics business, on july 27, 2017, we sold nextraq, a u.s. fleet telematics business, to michelin group for $316.5 million. we recorded a pre-tax gain on the disposal of nextraq of $175.0 million during the third quarter of 2017, which is net of transaction closing costs. we recorded tax on the gain of disposal of $65.8 million. the gain on the disposal is included in other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. nextraq had historically been included in our north america segment.
on september 30, 2017, we entered into an amended masternaut investment agreement that resulted in the loss of significant influence, and we began accounting for the masternaut investment by applying the cost method. as a result of our loss of significant influence and the operating results of masternaut, we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded its fair value, and concluded that this decline in value was other than temporary. we recorded a $44.6 million impairment loss in the masternaut investment that included an adjustment for $31.4 million of currency translation losses previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in 2017.

1 reflects the impact of the company's adoption of asc 606, which was adopted by the company on january 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. the adoption of asc 606 resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings in our consolidated balance sheet for the cumulative effect of applying the standard, which included costs incurred to obtain a contract, as well as presentation changes in our statements of income, including the classification of certain amounts previously classified as merchant commissions and processing expense net with revenues. as a result of the application of the modified retrospective transition method, the company's prior period results within its annual report on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q will not be restated to reflect the impact of asc 606.
•   organic growth of approximately 10% on a constant fuel price, fuel spread margin, foreign currency and acquisition and disposition basis, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction in certain of our payment programs. organic revenue growth has been calculated assuming asc 606 was implemented on january 1, 2017, in order to calculate organic growth using comparable revenue results in each period.
•   the impact of acquisitions completed in 2017, which contributed approximately $97 million in additional revenue.
•   although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a favorable impact on our consolidated revenue for 2018 over 2017 of approximately $6 million. we believe the favorable impact of higher fuel prices and fuel spread margins, primarily in the u.s., had a favorable impact on consolidated revenues in 2018 over 2017 of approximately $54 million, partially offset by the negative impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates on consolidated revenues in 2018 over 2017 of approximately $48 million, primarily due to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates in brazil and the u.k.
these increases were partially offset by the impact of the adoption of asc 606, which decreased consolidated revenues, net by approximately $112 million, for certain amounts previously classified as merchant commissions and processing expense, net with revenues and by approximately $26 million due to the disposition of the nextraq business in july 2017.
•   organic growth of approximately 9%, on a constant fuel price, fuel spread margin and pro forma basis, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction in certain of our payment programs. organic revenue growth has been calculated assuming asc 606 was implemented on january 1, 2017, in order to calculate organic growth using comparable revenue results in each period.
•   the impact of our cambridge and cls acquisitions completed during the third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively, which contributed approximately $91 million in additional revenue.
•   although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a positive impact on our north america segment revenue in 2018 over in 2017 of approximately $45 million, primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in fuel prices and slightly higher fuel spread margins.
these increases were partially offset by the impact of the adoption of asc 606, which decreased north america revenues, net by approximately $91 million and by approximately $26 million due to the disposition of the nextraq business in july 2017.
•   organic growth of approximately 12% on a constant macroeconomic and pro forma basis, driven by increases in both volume and revenue per transaction in certain of our payment programs. organic revenue growth has been calculated assuming asc 606 was implemented on january 1, 2017, in order to calculate organic growth using comparable revenue results in each period.
•   although we cannot precisely measure the impact of the macroeconomic environment, in total we believe it had a negative impact on our international segment revenue for 2018 over 2017 of approximately $39 million. changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues of approximately $46 million, partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in fuel prices of approximately $7 million.
•   the impact of a small fuel card acquisition during 2017, which contributed approximately $7 million in additional revenue.
the increases in consolidated revenues were partially offset by the impact of the adoption of asc 606, which decreased international revenues, net by approximately $21 million.

consolidated operating expenses merchant commission. the adoption of asc 606 on january 1, 2018, resulted in a change in the presentation of amounts previously classified as merchant commissions of $126.8 million in 2018. as of january 1, 2018, these amounts were recorded within revenues, net. merchant commissions were $113.1 million in 2017.
processing. processing expenses increased from $429.6 million in 2017 to $487.7 million in 2018, an increase of $58.1 million or 13.5%. increases in processing expenses were primarily due to expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2017 of approximately $35 million, which includes incremental bad debt expense of approximately $20 million, and organic growth in certain lines of business. additionally, the adoption of asc 606 on january 1, 2018, resulted in an increase of approximately $13 million to processing expenses in 2018. as of january 1, 2018, these amounts are recorded within revenues, net. these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of approximately $12 million and the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $6 million.
selling. selling expenses increased from $170.7 million in 2017 to $182.6 million in 2018, an increase of $11.9 million or 7.0%. increases in spending were primarily due to ongoing incremental expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2017 of approximately $14 million and additional spending in certain lines of business. these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $3 million and the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of approximately $3 million. additionally, the adoption of asc 606 and related cost capitalization guidance on january 1, 2018, resulted in the capitalization of certain costs incurred to obtain a contract (sales commissions) and deferral over the period of benefit, resulting in reduced selling expenses of approximately $5 million.
general and administrative. general and administrative expense increased from $387.7 million in 2017 to $389.2 million in 2018, an increase of $1.5 million or 0.4%. the increase was primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2017 of approximately $23 million and additional spending in certain lines of business. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense of approximately $23 million, the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $3 million and the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of approximately $6 million.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased from $264.6 million in 2017 to $274.6 million in 2018, an increase of $10.0 million or 3.8%. the increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions completed in 2017 of approximately $20 million and increased capital spending. these increases were partially
offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $5 million and the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of approximately $8 million.
other operating, net. other operating losses of $8.7 million in 2018 are a result of a write-off of capitalized software costs.
investment loss. investment loss was $7.1 million in 2018, a decrease of $46.0 million or 86.6% from $53.2 million in 2017. the decrease in investment loss was due to a non-cash impairment charge of $7.1 million recorded for a non-marketable investment in 2018 as compared to a non-cash impairment charge of $44.6 million recorded to our masternaut investment in 2017.
other (income) expense, net. other income, net was $152.2 million in 2018, a decrease of $21.3 million or 12.3% from $173.4 million in 2017. the decrease was due primarily to the pre-tax gain on the sale of our nextraq business of $175.0 million in 2017 as compared to the pre-tax gain on the sale of the chevron customer portfolio of approximately $152.8 million in 2018.
interest expense, net. interest expense increased from $107.1 million in 2017 to $138.5 million in 2018, an increase of $31.3 million or 29.3%. the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the impact of additional borrowings to repurchase our common stock, to finance the acquisition of cambridge completed in 2017 and increases in libor. the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility, excluding the related unused credit facility fees.

loss on extinguishment of debt. losses on extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million in 2018 and $3.3 million in 2017 relates to the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our credit facility during the fourth quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2017, respectively.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes increased from $153.4 million in 2017 to $283.6 million in 2018, an increase of $130.3 million or 84.9%. our effective tax rate increased to 25.9% for 2018 from 17.2% for 2017.
the 2017 rate included a net tax benefit of $128.2 million due to recording the provisional impact of the tax act in the fourth quarter of 2017. during 2018, we finalized our accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act, which resulted in adjustments to current tax expense and deferred taxes of $17.4 million and $7.1 million, respectively. we pay taxes in many different taxing  jurisdictions, including the u.s., most u.s. states and many non-u.s. jurisdictions. the tax rates in certain non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions are different than the u.s. tax rate. consequently, as our earnings fluctuate between taxing jurisdictions, our effective tax rate fluctuates.
net income. for the reasons discussed above, our net income increased from $740.2 million in 2017 to $811.5 million in 2018, an increase of $71.3 million or 9.6%.
operating income and operating margin consolidated operating income. operating income increased from $883.8 million in 2017 to $1,090.7 million in 2018, an increase of $206.9 million or 23.4%. consolidated operating margin was 39.3% in 2017 and 44.8% in 2018. these increases were driven by organic growth, acquisitions completed in 2017 and 2018 and the positive impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately $34 million driven by higher fuel prices and fuel price spreads, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $20 million. the increases were also driven by lower stock
based compensation of approximately $23 million. these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of the disposition of nextraq of approximately $9 million and the write-off of fixed assets of approximately $9 million.
for the purpose of segment operating results, we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue. segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue.
north america segment operating income. north america operating income increased from $541.6 million in 2017 to $673.9 million in 2018, an increase of $132.3 million, or 24.4%. north america operating margin was 37.9% in 2017 and 42.9% in 2018. the increases were due primarily to organic growth, acquisitions completed in 2017 and 2018 and the positive impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately $46 million, driven by higher fuel prices. the increase was also driven by lower stock based compensation of approximately $25 million. the increase was partially offset by the negative impact of the disposition of nextraq and the write-off of fixed assets.
international segment operating income. international operating income increased from $342.2 million in 2017 to $416.8 million in 2018, an increase of $74.7 million, or 21.8%. international operating margin was 41.7% in 2017 and 48.4% in 2018. the increases were due primarily to organic growth and acquisitions completed in 2017, partially offset by the negative impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately $12 million, driven by unfavorable movements in the foreign exchange rates. unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates were partially offset by higher fuel prices.

processing. processing expenses increased from $355.4 million in 2016 to $429.6 million in 2017, an increase of $74.2 million or 20.9%. increases in processing expenses were primarily due to expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $62 million, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by the impact of negotiated lower vendor processing costs. the increase in bad debt was primarily due to bad debt inherent in the acquired stp
business. these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $6 million.
selling. selling expenses increased from $131.4 million in 2016 to $170.7 million in 2017, an increase of $39.3 million or 29.9%. increases in spending were primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $26 million and additional spending in certain lines of business. these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $2 million.
general and administrative. general and administrative expense increased from $283.6 million in 2016 to $387.7 million in 2017, an increase of $104.1 million or 36.7%. the increase was primarily due to ongoing expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $42 million, increased stock based compensation expense of approximately $30 million and increases in other professional and legal fees totaling approximately $22 million. these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $2 million.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization increased from $203.3 million in 2016 to $264.6 million in 2017, an increase of $61.3 million or 30.2%. the increase was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $47 million and increased capital spending. these increases were partially offset by the impact of disposition of the nextraq business of approximately $4 million.
investment loss. investment losses increased from $36.4 million in 2016 to $53.2 million in 2017. we determined that the carrying value of our investment exceeded its fair value, and concluded that this decline in value was other than temporary. we recorded a $44.6 million impairment loss in the masternaut investment that includes adjustment for $31.4 million of currency translation losses previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.
other (income) expense, net. other income, net was $173.4 million in 2017, compared to other expense, net of $3.0 million in 2016. the increase was due primarily to the pre-tax gain on the sale of our nextraq business of $175 million in 2017.
interest expense, net. interest expense increased from $71.9 million in 2016 to $107.1 million in 2017, an increase of $35.3 million or 49.0%. the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the impact of additional borrowings to finance the acquisitions in 2016 and 2017, share buybacks and increases in libor. the following table sets forth the average interest rates paid on borrowings under our credit facility, excluding the related unused credit facility fees.
(unaudited)                                             2017          2016

revolving credit b facility-foreign swing line      2.01   %      1.84   %
the average unused credit facility fee for the revolving credit facilities was 0.35% and 0.31% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
loss on extinguishment of debt. loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.3 million relates to our write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing of our existing credit facility during the third quarter of 2017.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes decreased from $190.5 million in 2016 to $153.4 million in 2017, a decrease of $37.1 million or 19.5%, primarily driven by the impact of the enactment of the tax act, partially offset by the increase in pretax book income for 2017 as compared to 2016. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted tax legislation referred to as the tax act. the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the transition tax can be paid over eight years.
also, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin ("sab") 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act. in accordance with sab 118, we had a one-year measurement period in which to complete our accounting for the tax act.
we made an estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax, which resulted in a provisional net tax benefit of $128.2 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities after considering the u.s. federal income tax rate reduction to 21%. the one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from u.s. income taxes. in 2017, we recorded a provisional amount for the one-time transition tax liability of $81.8 million, net of foreign tax credits.
net income. for the reasons discussed above, our net income increased from $452.4 million in 2016 to $740.2 million in 2017, an increase of $287.8 million or 63.6%, primarily due to the impact of the enactment of the tax act on earnings of approximately $127.5 million and the gain on the disposition of nextraq of $109.2 million, partially offset by incremental amortization expense, stock based compensation expense, impairment of our investment in masternaut and legal fees during 2017.
operating income and operating margin consolidated operating income. operating income increased from $754.2 million in 2016 to $883.8 million in 2017, an increase of $129.6 million or 17.2%. consolidated operating margin was 41.2% in 2016 and 39.3% in 2017. the increase in operating income was primarily due to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017, organic growth, as well as the positive impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately $25 million, as previously discussed. these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $178 million, additional stock based compensation of approximately $30 million, higher professional and legal fees totaling approximately $22 million and the disposition of the nextraq business in july 2017 of approximately $8 million. the decrease in operating margin is driven by the items discussed above.
for the purpose of segment operating results, we calculate segment operating income by subtracting segment operating expenses from segment revenue. segment operating margin is calculated by dividing segment operating income by segment revenue.
north america segment operating income. north america operating income increased from $506.4 million in 2016 to $541.6 million in 2017, an increase of 35.2 million, or 6.9%. north america operating margin was 39.6% in 2016 and 37.9% in 2017. the increase in operating income was due primarily to organic growth and the positive impact of the macroeconomic environment of approximately $24 million, driven primarily by higher fuel prices. these increases were partially offset by additional stock based compensation of approximately $21 million, higher operating expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2017 of approximately $50 million, higher professional and legal fees totaling approximately $22 million and the disposition of the nextraq business in july 2017 of approximately $8 million. the decrease in operating margin is driven by the items discussed above.
international segment operating income. international operating income increased from $247.7 million in 2016 to $342.2 million in 2017, an increase of $94.4 million, or 38.1%. international operating margin was 44.8% in 2016 and 41.7% in 2017. the increase in operating income was due primarily to the impact of acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 and organic growth and the slightly positive impact of the macroeconomic environment. these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2016 and 2017 of approximately $128 million and additional stock based compensation of approximately $9 million. the decrease in operating margin is driven by the items discussed above.
liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are to service and repay our indebtedness, make acquisitions of businesses and commercial account portfolios, repurchase shares of our common stock and meet working capital, tax and capital expenditure needs.
sources of liquidity. at december 31, 2018, our cash balances totaled $1,364.9 million, with approximately $333.7 million restricted. restricted cash represents customer deposits in the czech republic and in our comdata business in the u.s., as well
as collateral received from customers for cross-currency transactions in our cambridge business, which are restricted from use other than to repay customer deposits, as well as secure and settle cross-currency transactions.
at december 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries where we have determined we are permanently reinvested was $702.4 million. all of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, excluding restricted cash, are available for general corporate purposes. our current intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. our current expectation for funds held in our foreign subsidiaries is to use the funds to finance foreign organic growth, to pay for potential future foreign acquisitions and to repay any foreign borrowings that may arise from time to time. we currently believe that funds generated from our u.s. operations, along with available borrowing capacity in the u.s. will be sufficient to fund our u.s. operations for the foreseeable future, and therefore do not foresee a need to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to fund our u.s. operations.
in the fourth quarter of 2017, the u.s. government enacted the tax act, which includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions. our final calculation of the one-time transition tax liability as a result of the tax act was $99.2 million. as permitted by the tax act, we began to pay the one-time transition tax in eight annual interest-free installments beginning in 2018. at december 31, 2018, we have remaining payments outstanding of $83.4 million.
we utilize an accounts receivable securitization facility to finance a majority of our domestic receivables, to lower our cost of borrowing and more efficiently use capital. we generate and record accounts receivable when a customer makes a purchase from a merchant using one of our card products and generally pay merchants before collecting the receivable. as a result, we utilize the securitization facility as a source of liquidity to provide the cash flow required to fund merchant payments while we collect customer balances. these balances are primarily composed of charge balances, which are typically billed to the customer on a weekly, semimonthly or monthly basis, and are generally required to be paid within 14 days of billing. we also consider the undrawn amounts under our securitization facility and credit facility as funds available for working capital purposes and acquisitions. at december 31, 2018, we had no additional liquidity under our securitization facility. at december 31, 2018, we had approximately $249.6 million available under our credit facility.
based on our current forecasts and anticipated market conditions, we believe that our current cash balances, our available borrowing capacity and our ability to generate cash from operations, will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. however, we regularly evaluate our cash requirements for current operations, commitments, capital requirements and acquisitions, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt or equity securities. we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all.
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
net cash provided by operating activities                    $903.4                $680.1                  $708.2
net cash used in investing activities                         (26.3    )           (497.8    )           (1,389.6    )

operating activities. net cash provided by operating activities increased from $680.1 million in 2017 to $903.4 million in 2018. the increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher net income and the change in deferred income taxes due to the impact of the tax act in 2017, partially offset by unfavorable working capital adjustments primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments in 2018.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased from $708.2 million in 2016 to $680.1 million in 2017. operating cash flows were primarily affected by higher net income and deferred income taxes resulting from enactment of the tax act. also included in cash flows from operating activities were unfavorable working capital adjustments primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and payments in 2017 over the comparable period in 2016.
investing activities. net cash used in investing activities decreased from $497.8 million in 2017 to $26.3 million in 2018. this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in cash outlay for acquisitions. also, the proceeds received from the sale of our nextraq business in 2017 was much higher than those from the sale of chevron in 2018.
net cash used in investing activities decreased from $1.4 billion in 2016 to $497.8 million in 2017. this decrease was primarily due to reduction in cash outlay for acquisitions and the proceeds received from the sale of our nextraq business during the third quarter of 2017.
financing activities. net cash used in financing activities was $577.8 million in 2018, compared to net cash provided of $251.9 million in 2017. the increased use of cash is primarily due to increased spending to repurchase our common stock of $556.3 million in 2018 over 2017, a reduction in net borrowings of $147.9 million on our credit facility and a reduction in net borrowings of $145.0 million on our securitization facility.
net cash provided by financing activities decreased from $754.0 million in 2016 to $251.9 million in 2017. the decrease is primarily due to additional repayments on our credit facility of $599.8 million in 2017 over 2016, and increased spending to repurchase our common stock of $214.7 million, partially offset by an increase in borrowings of $243 million on our securitization facility and an increase in borrowings of $55.5 million on our credit facility.
capital spending summary our capital expenditures increased from $70.1 million in 2017 to $81.4 million in 2018, an increase of $11 million or 16.1%. this increase is primarily due to increased spending on strategic projects, including continued investment in our operating systems, as well as incremental spending related to acquisitions in 2016 and 2017.
our capital expenditures increased from $59.0 million in 2016 to $70.1 million in 2017, an increase of $11 million or 18.8%. this increase is primarily due to increased spending on strategic projects, including continued investment in our operating systems, as well as incremental spending related to acquisitions in 2016 and 2017.

stock repurchase program on february 4, 2016, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program (the "program") under which we may purchase up to an aggregate of $500 million of our common stock over the following 18 months period. on july 27, 2017, our board of directors authorized an increase in the size of the program by an additional $250 million and an extension of the program by an additional 18 months. on november 1, 2017, we announced that our board of directors had authorized an additional increase in the size of the program by an another $350 million and on july 17, 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional increase of $500 million in the size of the program. with the increase and giving effect to $1.5 billion of previous repurchases, we may repurchase up to $551 million in shares of our common stock at any time prior to february 1, 2020.
any stock repurchases may be made at times and in such amounts as deemed appropriate. the timing and amount of stock repurchases, if any, will depend on a variety of factors including the stock price, market conditions, corporate and regulatory requirements, and any additional constraints related to material inside information we may possess. any repurchases have been and are expected to be funded by a combination of available cash flow from the business, working capital and debt.
on august 3, 2017, as part of the program, we entered an accelerated share repurchase agreement ("2017 asr agreement") with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $250 million of our common stock. pursuant to the 2017 asr agreement, we delivered $250 million in cash and received 1,491,647 shares based on a stock price of $142.46 on august 7, 2017. the 2017 asr agreement was completed on september 7, 2017, at which time we received 263,012 additional shares based on a final weighted average per share purchase price during the repurchase period of $142.48.
on december 14, 2018, as part of the program, we entered an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement ("2018 asr agreement") with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $220 million of our common stock. pursuant to the 2018 asr agreement, we delivered $220 million in cash and received 1,057,035 shares based on a stock price of $176.91 on december 14, 2018. the 2018 asr agreement was completed on january 29, 2019, at which time we received 117,751 additional shares based on a final weighted average per share purchase price during the repurchase period of $187.27.
we accounted for the 2017 and 2018 asr agreements as two separate transactions: (i) as shares of reacquired common stock for the shares delivered to us upon effectiveness of each asr agreement and (ii) as a forward contract indexed to the our common stock for the undelivered shares. the initial delivery of shares was included in treasury stock at cost and results in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. the forward contracts indexed to the company's own common stock met the criteria for equity classification, and these amounts were initially recorded in additional paid-in capital.
since the beginning of the program, 9,025,542 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion have been repurchased. there were 4,911,438 common shares totaling $958.7 million, 2,854,959 common shares totaling $402.4 million and 1,259,145 common shares totaling $187.7 million repurchased under the program during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
critical accounting policies and estimates in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. some of these estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. in many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. we refer to estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. our significant accounting policies are summarized in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements.
see footnote 2 to the consolidated financial statements, summary of significant accounting policies.
revenue recognition and presentation. we provide payment solutions to our business, merchant, consumer and payment network customers. our payment solutions are primarily focused on specific commercial spend categories, including fuel, lodging, tolls, and general corporate payments, as well as gift card solutions (stored value cards). we provide products that help businesses of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. we also provide other payment solutions for fleet maintenance, employee benefits and long haul transportation-related services.
payment services our primary performance obligation for the majority of our payment solution products (fuel, lodging, corporate payments, among others) is to stand-ready to provide authorization and processing services ("payment services") for an unknown or unspecified quantity of transactions and the consideration received is contingent upon the customer's use (e.g., number of transactions submitted and processed) of the related payment services. accordingly, the total transaction price is variable. payment services involve a series of distinct daily services that are substantially the same, with the same pattern of transfer to the customer. for the tolls payment solution, the company's primary performance obligation is to stand-ready each month to provide access to the toll network and process toll transactions. each period of access is determined to be distinct and substantially the same as the customer benefits over the period of access.
we record revenue for our payment services net of (i) the cost of the underlying products and services; (ii) assessments and other fees charged by the credit and debit payment networks (along with any rebates provided by them); (iii) customer rebates and other discounts; and (iv) taxes assessed (e.g. vat and vat-like taxes) by a government, imposed concurrent with, a revenue producing transaction.
the majority of the transaction price we receive for fulfilling the payment services performance obligation are comprised of one or a combination of the following: 1) interchange fees earned from the payment networks; 2) discount fees earned from merchants; 3) fees calculated based on a number of transactions processed; 4) fees calculated based upon a percentage of the transaction value for the underlying goods or services (i.e. fuel, food, toll and transportation cards and vouchers); and 5) monthly access fees.
we recognize revenue when the underlying transactions are complete and our performance obligations are satisfied. transactions are considered complete depending upon the related payment solution but generally when we have authorized the transaction, validated that the transaction has no errors and accepted and posted the data to our records.
our performance obligation for our foreign exchange payment services is providing a foreign currency payment to a customer's designated recipient and therefore, we recognize revenue on foreign exchange payment services when the underlying payment is made. revenues from foreign exchange payment services are primarily comprised of the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market.
gift card products and services our gift product line delivers both stored value cards and card-based services primarily in the form of gift cards to retailers. these activities each represent performance obligations that are separate and distinct. revenue for stored valued cards are recognized (gross of the underlying cost of the related card, recorded within processing expense within the consolidated statements of income) at the point in time when control passes to our customer, which is generally upon shipment.
card-based services consist of transaction processing and reporting of gift card transactions where we recognize revenue based on an output measure of elapsed time for an unknown or unspecified quantity of transactions. as a result, we allocate and recognize variable consideration over the estimated period of time over which the performance obligation is satisfied.
other we account for revenue from late fees and finance charges, in jurisdictions where permitted under local regulations, primarily in the u.s. and canada in accordance with asc 310, "receivables". such fees are recognized net of a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts, at the time the fees and finance charges are assessed and services are provided. we cease billing and accruing for late fees and finance charges approximately 30 - 40 days after the customer's balance becomes delinquent.
we also write foreign currency forward and option contracts for our customers to facilitate future payments in foreign currencies, and recognize revenue in accordance with authoritative fair value and derivative accounting (asc 815, "derivatives").
revenue is also derived from the sale of equipment in certain of our businesses, which is recognized at the time the device is sold and control has passed to the customer. this revenue is recognized gross of the cost of sales related to the equipment in "revenues, net" within the consolidated statements of income. the related cost of sales for the equipment is recorded within "processing expenses" in the consolidated statements of income.
revenues from contracts with customers, within the scope of topic 606, represents approximately 80% of total consolidated revenues, net, the year ended december 31, 2018.
contract liabilities deferred revenue contract liabilities for customers subject to asc 606 were $30.6 million and $30.2 million as of december 31, 2018 and january 1, 2018, respectively. we expect to recognize substantially all of these amounts in revenues within approximately 12 months.  revenue recognized for the year ended december 31, 2018, that was included in the deferred revenue contract liability as of january 1, 2018 was approximately $26.6 million.
costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with the adoption of asc 606, we began capitalizing the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect to recover those costs. the incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those that we incur to obtain a contract with a customer that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained (for example, a sales commission).
costs incurred to fulfill a contract are capitalized if those costs meet all of the following criteria:
a.   the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify.
b.   the costs generate or enhance resources of ours that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future.
c.   the costs are expected to be recovered.
in order to determine the appropriate amortization period for contract costs, we considered a combination of factors, including customer attrition rates, estimated terms of customer relationships, the useful lives of technology used by us to provide products and services to our customers, whether further contract renewals are expected and if there is any incremental commission to be paid on a contract renewal. contract acquisition and fulfillment costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the expected period of benefit (ranging from five to ten years). costs to obtain a contract with an expected period of benefit of one
year or less are recognized as an expense when incurred. the amortization of contract acquisition costs associated with sales commissions that qualify for capitalization will be recorded as selling expense in our consolidated statements of income. the amortization of contract acquisition costs associated with cash payments for client incentives is included as a reduction of revenues in our consolidated statements of income.  for the year ended december 31, 2018, amortization of capitalized contract costs recorded in selling expense was $12 million.
costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are classified as contract cost assets within "prepaid expenses and other current assets" and "other assets" in our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2018, we had capitalized costs to obtain a contract of $12.7 million within prepaid expenses and $34.5 million within "other assets" in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.
we have recorded $83.9 million, $96.9 million and $91.6 million of expenses related to sales of equipment within the processing expenses line of the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
practical expedients asc 606 requires disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations; however, as allowed by asc 606, we elected to exclude this disclosure for any contracts with an original duration of one year or less and any variable consideration that meets specified criteria. as described above, our most significant performance obligations consist of variable consideration under a stand-ready series of distinct days of service. such variable consideration meets the specified criteria for the disclosure exclusion; therefore, the majority of the aggregate amount of transaction price that is allocated to performance obligations that have not yet been satisfied is variable consideration that is not required for this disclosure. the aggregate fixed consideration portion of customer contracts with an initial contract duration greater than one year is not material.
we elected to exclude all sales taxes and other similar taxes from the transaction price. accordingly, we present all collections from customers for these taxes on a net basis, rather than having to assess whether we are acting as an agent or a principal in each taxing jurisdiction.
in certain arrangements with customers, we determined that certain promised services and products are immaterial in the context of the contract, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
as a practical expedient, we are not required to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer a promised service or product to a customer and when the customer pays for the service or product will be one year or less. as of december 31, 2018, our contracts with customers did not contain a significant financing component.
we adopted topic 606 as of january 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. for contracts that were modified before the effective date, we utilized a practical expedient to consider the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying performance obligations and allocating transaction price.
accounts receivable. as described above under the heading "securitization facility," we maintain a revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility. the current purchase limit under the securitization facility is $1.2 billion. accounts receivable collateralized within our securitization facility relate to trade receivables resulting from charge card activity in the u.s. pursuant to the terms of the securitization facility, we transfer certain of our domestic receivables, on a revolving basis, to fleetcor funding llc (funding), a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary. in turn, funding transfers, without recourse, on a revolving basis, an undivided ownership interest in this pool of accounts receivable to a multi-seller, asset-backed commercial paper conduit (conduit). funding maintains a subordinated interest, in the form of over-collateralization, in a portion of the receivables sold to the conduit. purchases by the conduit are financed with the sale of highly-rated commercial paper.
we utilize proceeds from the transfer of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of financing, to reduce our overall borrowing costs. we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates, which approximates our cost of servicing. we retain a residual interest in the accounts receivable sold as a form of credit enhancement. the residual interest's fair value approximates carrying value due to its short-term nature. funding determines the level of funding achieved by the sale of trade accounts receivable, subject to a maximum amount.
our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income reflect the activity related to securitized accounts receivable and the corresponding securitized debt, including interest income, fees generated from late payments, provision for losses on accounts receivable and interest expense. the cash flows from borrowings and repayments, associated with the securitized debt, are presented as cash flows from financing activities.
foreign receivables are not included in our receivable securitization program. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, there was $886 million and $811 million, respectively, of short-term debt outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility.
credit risk and reserve for losses on receivables. we control credit risk by performing periodic credit evaluations of our customers. payments from customers are generally due within 14 days or less of billing. we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make provisions for probable doubtful accounts based primarily on the aging of those balances. accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible from the customer once they age past 90 days. we also provide an allowance for receivables aged less than 90 days that we expect will be uncollectible based on historical collections experience including accounts that have filed for bankruptcy. at december 31, 2018, approximately 99% of outstanding accounts receivable were current. accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are removed from accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts when internal collection efforts have been exhausted and accounts have been turned over to a third-party collection agency. recoveries from the third-party collection agency are not significant.
impairment of long-lived assets, intangibles and investments. we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. when factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable. we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may warrant revision.
we complete an impairment test of goodwill at least annually or more frequently if facts or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. we first perform a qualitative assessment of certain of its reporting units. factors considered in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of our reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units, sustained decrease in our share price, and other relevant entity-specific events. if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test would be required. we then perform the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit by comparing the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon, among other factors, a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as market multiples for comparable companies. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired.
based on the goodwill asset impairment analysis performed quantitatively on october 1, 2018, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of the carrying value. no events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of this most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
we also evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks and trade names) for impairment annually. we also test for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is below its carrying amount. estimates critical to our evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment include the discount rate, royalty rates used in our evaluation of trade names, projected average revenue growth and projected long-term growth rates in the determination of terminal values. an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date.
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our investments, which are not carried at fair value, for impairment. we have elected to measure certain equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for similar investments of the issuer.
income taxes. we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date.
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the associated temporary differences become deductible. we evaluate on a quarterly basis whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and conclude whether a valuation allowance must be established.
current accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribes threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. under the relevant authoritative literature, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. we include any estimated interest and penalties on tax related matters in income tax expense.
in the fourth quarter of 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax act. as a result of the tax act, the u.s. federal corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%. the tax act also includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions. we recognized a deferred tax benefit of $210 million to reflect the reduced u.s. tax rate and other effects of the tax act as of december 31, 2017. the final deferred tax benefit was adjusted to $202.9 million during the one-year measurement period. the reduced benefit on deferred taxes was driven by the reduced federal benefit received on state income taxes as a result of the lower federal tax rate enacted by the tax act. we recognized a provisional net tax benefit of $128.2 million as of december 31, 2017. during the tax year ended december 31, 2018, the company finalized its accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act in accordance with its understanding of the tax act and the guidance available as of the date of this filing. after the adjustments recognized during 2018, the overall net tax benefit of the tax act was adjusted to $103.7 million. the accounting for the tax effects of the tax act has been completed as of december 31, 2018. see note 12 for further information regarding income taxes.
business combinations. business combinations completed by us have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. the acquisition method requires that the acquired assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at fair value determined as of the acquisition date. for significant acquisitions, we obtain independent third-party valuation studies for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to assist us in determining fair value. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations beginning from the completion date of the applicable transaction.
estimates of fair value are revised during an allocation period as necessary when, and if, information becomes available to further define and quantify the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. provisional estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves a number of estimates and assumptions that could differ materially from the final amounts recorded. the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition. to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period, the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted. should information become available after the allocation period, those items are adjusted through operating results. the direct costs of the acquisition are recorded as operating expenses. certain acquisitions include contingent consideration related to the performance of the acquired operations following the acquisition. contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition, and is remeasured each reporting period, with any changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of income. we estimate the fair value of the acquisition-related contingent consideration using various valuation approaches, as well as significant unobservable inputs, reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities.
stock-based compensation. we account for employee stock options and restricted stock in accordance with relevant authoritative literature. stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant as authorized by our board of directors. options granted have vesting provisions ranging from one to five years and vesting of the options is generally based on the passage of time or performance. stock option grants are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. we have selected the black-scholes option pricing model for estimating the grant date fair value of stock option awards. we have considered the retirement and forfeiture provisions of the options and utilized our historical experience to estimate the expected life of the options. option forfeitures are accounted for upon occurrence. we base the risk-free interest rate on the yield of a zero coupon u.s. treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant. stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on the number of years which the requisite service is expected to be rendered.
awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units are independent of stock option grants and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. the vesting of shares granted is generally based on the passage of time or performance, or a combination of these. shares vesting based on the passage of time have vesting provisions of one to three years. the fair value of restricted stock where the shares vest based on the passage of time or performance is based on the grant date fair value of our stock.
for performance-based restricted stock awards and performance based stock option awards, we must also make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance goals. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected.
derivatives. we use derivatives to facilitate cross-currency corporate payments by writing derivatives to customers. with our cambridge business, we use derivatives to facilitate cross-currency corporate payments by writing derivatives to customers, which are not designated as hedging instruments. the majority of cambridge's revenue is from exchanges of currency at spot rates, which enable customers to make cross-currency payments. in addition, cambridge also writes foreign currency forward and option contracts for its customers to facilitate future payments. the duration of these derivative contracts at inception is generally less than one year. we aggregate our foreign exchange exposures arising from customer contracts, including forwards, options and spot exchanges of currency, and hedges (economic hedge) the resulting net currency risks by entering into offsetting contracts with established financial institution counterparties. the changes in fair value related to these contracts are recorded in revenues, net in the consolidated statements of income.
we recognize all derivatives in "prepaid expenses and other current assets" and "other current liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. all cash flows associated with derivatives are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
pending adoption of recently issued accounting standards from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, the company's management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
accounting for leases. in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, "leases", which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for leases. this asu also requires disclosures to provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. this asu is effective for us for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2018 and interim periods therein. on july 31, 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-11, "leases (topic 842): targeted improvements", which provides (1) an optional transition method that entities can use when adopting asc 842 and (2) a practical expedient that permits lessors to not separate nonlease components from the associated lease component if certain conditions are met. under this new transition method, an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. we will elect this transition method at the adoption date of january 1, 2019 and will not restate comparative periods. prior comparative periods will be reported under asc 840. we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allows us to carryforward the historical lease classification. we also expect to make an accounting policy election to use the short term lease exception and will not record a right-of-use-asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. we will recognize those lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. we have analyzed our lease portfolio, as well as our accounting policies and internal controls that will be impacted by the new guidance. we have also implemented lease accounting software to support the new reporting requirements. while certain adoption procedures are ongoing, including the discount rate determination and validating our completeness of the lease population, we do not believe the new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or liquidity. the standard will have no impact on our debt-covenant compliance under our current agreements. we are still in the process of finalizing the impact on the consolidated financial statements.
accounting for derivative financial instruments. in august 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-12, "derivatives and hedging (topic 815): targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities", which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements in asc 815. the fasb issued accounting guidance to better align hedge accounting with a company's risk management activities, simplify the application of hedge accounting and improve the disclosures of hedging arrangements. the guidance is effective for us for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. early adoption is permitted. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. the asu should, however, simplify our accounting for interest rate swap hedges.
in october 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-16, which amends asc 2018-16, "derivatives and hedging (topic 815): inclusion of the secured overnight financing rate, overnight index swap rate as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes," which amends the hedge accounting to add overnight index swap rates based on the secured overnight financing rate as a fifth u.s. benchmark interest rate. the guidance is effective for us for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. early adoption is permitted. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
comprehensive income classification. in february 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-02, "income statement - reporting comprehensive income (topic 220): reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income", that gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings tax effects related to items that have been stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the tax act. an entity that elects to reclassify these amounts must reclassify stranded tax effects related to the tax act's change in u.s. federal tax rate for all items accounted for in other comprehensive income. these entities can also elect to reclassify other stranded effects that relate to the tax act but do not directly relate to the change in the federal rate. for all entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. entities can choose whether to apply the amendments retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the tax act is recognized or to apply the amendments in the period of adoption. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
non-employee share-based payments. in june 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-07, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to non-employee share-based payment accounting", that supersedes asc 505-50 and expands the scope of asc 718 to include all share-based payment arrangements related to the acquisition of goods and services from both non-employees and employees. under the new guidance, the existing employee guidance will apply to non-employee share-based transactions (as long as the transaction is not effectively a form of financing), with the exception of specific guidance related to the attribution of compensation cost. the cost of non-employee awards will continue to be recorded as if the grantor had paid cash for the goods or services. in addition, the contractual term will be able to be used in lieu of an expected term in the option-pricing model for non-employee awards. the guidance is effective for us for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. early adoption is permitted, including in interim periods, but no earlier than an entity's adoption of asc 606. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
cloud computing arrangements. on august 29, 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-15, "intangibles-goodwill and other- internal-use software (subtopic 350-40): customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract", that provides guidance on implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement (cca) that is a service contract. the asu, which was released in response to a consensus reached by the eitf at its june 2018 meeting, aligns the accounting for such costs with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. specifically, the asu amends asc 350 to include in its scope implementation costs of a cca that is a service contract and clarifies that a customer should apply asc 350-40 to determine which implementation costs should be capitalized in such a cca. the guidance is effective for us for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted, including in interim periods. the guidance should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
fair value measurement. on august 28, 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-13, "fair value measurement (topic 820): disclosure framework-changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement", which removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements in asc 820. the guidance is effective for us for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2019. the guidance on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. all other guidance should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. we are permitted to early adopt any removed or modified disclosures upon issuance of this guidance and delay adoption of the additional disclosures until their effective date. our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our disclosures.
credit losses on financial instruments. in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, "financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments", which changes how companies measure and recognize credit impairment for many financial assets. the new expected credit loss model will require companies to immediately recognize an estimate of credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of the financial assets (including trade receivables) that are in the scope of the update. the update also made amendments to the current impairment model for held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities and certain guarantees. the asu is effective for us on january 1, 2020. early adoption is permitted for periods beginning on or after january 1, 2019. we are evaluating the effect of asu 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.
recently adopted accounting standards impact of adoption of asc 606
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (asc 606)", which replaces numerous requirements in u.s. gaap, including industry-specific requirements, and provides companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of asu 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the two permitted transition methods under the standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. asu 2014-09, as amended by asu 2015-14, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective date", is effective for years beginning after december 15, 2017, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted for years beginning after december 15, 2016. since the issuance of asu 2014-09, the fasb has issued additional interpretive guidance, including new accounting standard updates ans asc subtopic 340-40: other assets and deferred costs - contracts with customers, which clarifies certain points of the standard and modifies certain requirements.
effective january 1, 2018, we adopted asc 606 using the modified retrospective method, for contracts that were not completed as of the date of initial application, resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on january 1, 2018. for contracts that were modified before january 1, 2018, we have not retrospectively restated contracts for those modifications but instead reflected the aggregate effect of these modifications when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, as allowed within the transition practical expedients. the cumulative impact to retained earnings at january 1, 2018 was $30.2 million, due to the capitalization of costs to acquire contracts under the new standard, with a corresponding increase to prepaid expense and other current assets of $10.2 million, other assets of $30.3 million and deferred income taxes (liabilities) of $10.3 million over the respective implied period of benefit. additionally, under the new standard certain costs (e.g., merchant commissions and fees paid to credit card associations) will be presented net in revenues as the amounts represent payments to our customers that are not considered in exchange for a distinct good or service that the customer transfers to us.

the adoption of asc 606 did not impact our accounting for revenues derived from late fees, finance charges, and certain other charge card fees or certain of our foreign currency contracts, which continue to be accounted for under existing authoritative guidance, as discussed further footnote 3 to the consolidated financial statements, summary of significant accounting policies.
intra-entity transfers in october 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-16 "income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory." the new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other
than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. for intercompany transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. the company adopted this asu on january 1, 2018, which resulted in an increase of approximately $17.1 million to retained earnings and an increase of $25.9 million to deferred tax assets and reduced prepaid tax by $8.8 million.
accounting for breakage in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-04, "liabilities-extinguishments of liabilities: recognition of breakage for certain prepaid stored-value products", which requires entities that sell prepaid stored value products redeemable for goods, services or cash at third-party merchants to derecognize liabilities related to those products for breakage. this asu is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the asu must be adopted using either a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption or a full retrospective approach. the company adopted this guidance on january 1, 2018, which did not have a material impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
cash flow classification in august 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-15, "classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments", which amends the guidance in asc 230, statement of cash flows. this amended guidance reduces the diversity in practice that has resulted from the lack of consistent principles related to the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. this asu is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable. the company adopted this new guidance on january 1, 2018. the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
in november 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-18, "statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash", which amends the guidance in asc 230, statement of cash flows, on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. this asu is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017 and changes due to adoption are applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. the company adopted this new guidance on january 1, 2018, and applied retrospectively to results for 2017. the adoption of topic 230 resulted in the statement of cash flows presenting the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.
intangibles - goodwill and other impairment in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-04, "simplifying the test for goodwill impairment", which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., step 2 of the goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on step 1). the standard has tiered effective dates, starting in 2020 for calendar-year public business entities that meet the definition of an sec filer. early adoption is permitted for interim and annual goodwill impairment testing dates after january 1, 2017. the adoption of this asu on january 1, 2018 did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
definition of a business in january 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-01, "clarifying the definition of a business", which amends the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. the guidance requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. if so, the set of transferred assets and activities is not a business. the guidance also requires a business to include at least one substantive process and narrows the definition of outputs. the guidance is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years. the company adopted this new guidance on january 1, 2018. the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
accounting for modifications to stock-based compensation in may 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-09, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): scope of modification accounting", which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. the asu provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to apply modification accounting under asc 718. specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. the guidance is effective for the company for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim periods within
those years. the company adopted this new guidance on january 1, 2018. the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

(a)   deferred income tax liabilities as of december 31, 2018 were approximately $488.8 million. refer to note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements. this amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. as a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, as this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs. at december 31, 2018, we had approximately $34.2 million of unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. we cannot reasonably estimate when all of these unrecognized income tax benefits may be settled. we do not expect reductions to unrecognized income tax benefits within the next 12 months as a result of projected resolutions of income tax uncertainties.
(b)   we draw upon and pay down on the revolver within our credit agreement and our securitization facility borrowings outside of a normal schedule, as excess cash is available. for our variable rate debt, we have assumed the december 31, 2018 interest rates to calculate the estimated interest payments, for all years presented. this analysis also assumes that outstanding principal is held constant at the december 31, 2018 balances for our credit agreement and securitization facility, except for mandatory pay downs on the term loans in accordance with the loan documents. we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or other short-term borrowings.
(c)   the long-term portion of contingent consideration agreements and cambridge seller note due within the next 12 months is included with 'other debt' in the detail of our debt instruments disclosed in note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements.
management's use of non-gaap financial measures we have included in the discussion above certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap. any analysis of non-gaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap. below, we define the non-gaap financial measures, provide a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap, and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors.
pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions by product. we define the pro forma and macro adjusted revenue as revenue, net as reflected in our statement of income, adjusted to eliminate the impact of the macroeconomic environment and the impact of acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of adoption of asc 606. the macroeconomic environment includes the impact that market fuel spread margins, fuel prices and foreign exchange rates have on our business. we use pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions to evaluate the organic growth in our revenue and the associated transactions. set forth
below is a reconciliation of pro forma and macro adjusted revenue and transactions to the most directly comparable gaap measure, revenue, net and transactions (in millions):

2 adjustments related to one-time items not representative of normal business operations.
adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. we have defined the non-gaap measure adjusted net income as net income as reflected in our statement of income, adjusted to eliminate (a) non-cash stock based compensation expense related to share based compensation awards, (b) amortization of deferred financing costs, discounts and intangible assets, amortization of the premium recognized on the purchase of receivables, and our proportionate share of amortization of intangible assets at our equity method investment, and (c) other non-recurring items, including the impact of the 2017 tax act, impairment charges, asset write-offs, restructuring costs, gains due to disposition of assets and a business, loss on extinguishment of debt, legal settlements, and the unauthorized access costs.
we use adjusted net income to eliminate the effect of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. we believe it is useful to exclude non-cash stock based compensation expense from adjusted net income because non-cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time and stock based compensation expense is not a key measure of our core operating performance. we also believe that amortization expense can vary substantially from company to company and from period to period depending upon their financing and accounting methods, the fair value and average expected life of their acquired intangible assets, their capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired. therefore, we have excluded amortization expense from adjusted net income. we also believe one-time non-recurring gains, losses, and impairment charges do not necessarily reflect how our investments and business are performing. we believe that adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are appropriate supplemental measures of financial performance and may be useful to investors to understanding our operating performance on a consistent basis. adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be used as such.
set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable gaap measure, net income and net income per diluted share (in thousands, except per share amounts)*:

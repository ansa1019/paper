item 1a.    risk factors our operations are affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. in evaluating investment in the company and the forward-looking information contained in this annual report on form 10-k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time, you should consider the following risk factors. any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well. while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.
unfavorable conditions in the global economy, the markets we serve, or the financial markets, may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash flows.
demand for the company's products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which the company does business. weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in markets served by the company have impacted in the past and may impact in the future demand for the company's products and services, in turn negatively impacting the company's revenues and earnings. unfavorable conditions can depress sales, affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility, impact efficient utilization of the company's manufacturing capacity, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. excess capacity in the company's or its competitors' manufacturing facilities can decrease the company's ability to maintain pricing and generate profits.
our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. a decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to the company, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated contract terminations, project delays, or inability to recover plant investments negatively impacting our financial results.
weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or default, or other inabilities to operate facilities profitably, and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming on-stream. these or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market, product, or customer events may require the company to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.
our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal risks, and currency translation, that could decrease profitability.
in 2017, over 60% of our sales were derived from customers outside the united states and many of our operations, suppliers, and employees are located outside the united states. our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the united states, particularly in high-growth markets. our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations, import and trade restrictions, and trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting u.s. companies doing business abroad. changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, strained relations between countries, or imposition of international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
we are actively investing significant capital and other resources in developing markets, which present special risks, including through joint ventures. our developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and talent risks. our contractual relationship within these jurisdictions may be subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time.
because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the united states, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. we choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' earnings into dollars. accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. for a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see item 7a - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, below.
the operation of our facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. if operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flows. in addition, our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements, which depends, in part, on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets.
some of our projects involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods, sometimes up to several years. we may encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and materials delivery delays, schedule changes, delays from customer failure to timely obtain regulatory permits and rights-of-way, inability to find adequate sources of labor in the geographies where we are building new plants, weather-related delays, delays by subcontractors in completing their portion of the project and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, but which may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule. in some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. we may not be able to recover any of these costs. these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts.
we are subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which we do business. regulations addressing, among other things, environmental compliance, import/export restrictions, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
we are subject to government regulation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conducts our business. the application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear. compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results. compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs. export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses. increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirements, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the united kingdom bribery act and the china anti-unfair competition law, could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation occurs. in addition, we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the u.s. or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities.
further, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or our business partners (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. in addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.
we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, or effectively disentangle divested businesses.
our ability to grow revenue, earnings, and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify, successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices; and realize expected synergies and operating efficiencies. we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. in addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses, the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack contractual protections or insurance. we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations.
we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. for example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all. in addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. in addition, we have agreed and may in the future agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities. our financial results could be impacted by claims under these indemnities.
the security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.
we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers. if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information or multiple site impact through a security breach. in addition, these systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers.
as with most large systems, our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. to date, we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation, or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
our business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our employees, vendors, and customers. the protection of such information, as well as our information, is critical to us. the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. we have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. we also, from time to time, export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the united states. breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.
interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.
hydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of our business. because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings. a disruption in the supply of energy, components, or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, natural events, or other disruption, could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments, harming our business and financial results.
we typically contract to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers, but cost variability can still have a negative impact on our results. we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery. increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact our revenues and earnings. even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.
our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, or acts of war and terrorism. any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose it to third-party liability claims. additionally, such events could impact our suppliers or customers, in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to us, or our customers may be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results.
we are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings. existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base. these technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or damage to our reputations. large scale gasification projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination and, although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others, such technologies or processes may be new to us.
our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.
we are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. while we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable at law. also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular period.
costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.
we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of our products. future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. in addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. these additional costs may adversely affect financial results. for a more detailed description of these matters, see item 1 - business environmental controls, above.
we are the world's leading supplier of hydrogen, the primary use of which is the production of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health. to make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers, we use steam methane reforming, which releases carbon dioxide. some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ("ghg"), including carbon dioxide. these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading scheme, california and ontario cap and trade schemes, alberta's specified gas emitters regulation, china's emission trading scheme pilots, south korea's emission trading scheme, and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions under an ontario cap and trade scheme, nation-wide expansion of the china emission trading scheme, and revisions to the alberta regulation. in addition, the u.s. environmental protection agency ("epa") requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs.
increased public concern may result in more international, u.s. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power and hydrogen production. we believe it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.
implementation of the united kingdom's ("uk") exit from european union ("eu") membership, or recent political instability in spain, could adversely affect our european operations.
the uk's exit from eu membership may adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business. although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom's future relationship with the eu will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu members and increased regulatory complexities. any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our european business.
in addition, there has been recent political instability in catalonia, spain. we maintain an administrative office in catalonia which provides transactional accounting and other support services for our entire european business, and fiscal year 2017 sales of approximately us$320 million were attributable to spain. these operations could be impacted by the outcome of the current unrest.
inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.
we face strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of our business segments. introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of our products, negatively impacting financial results. in addition, competitors' pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share.
the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.
the multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. the company's future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. for example, the united states congress is considering comprehensive tax reform which, among other things, may significantly reduce the corporate tax rate and change certain u.s. tax rules impacting the way u.s. based multinationals are taxed on foreign income. changes to the tax system in the united states, particularly a proposed mandatory deemed repatriation tax, could have a material impact to our financial statements. the cumulative undistributed earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures on the consolidated balance sheets amounted to $6,032.5 as of 30 september 2017. the potential impact of the mandatory deemed repatriation proposal and other proposals is uncertain at this time, especially as the outcome of u.s. tax reform discussions is unknown. at this time, we are properly reflecting the provision for taxes on income using all current enacted global tax laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate.
we could incur significant liability if the distribution of versum common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.
we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the spin-off of versum qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(d) of the internal revenue code. the opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from versum and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the irs could determine on audit that the spin-off is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. if the spin-off is determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to u.s. federal income tax and we could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities.

the discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to certain non-gaap ("adjusted") financial measures. the presentation of non-gaap measures is intended to provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful supplemental information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with gaap, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. the reconciliations of reported gaap results to non-gaap measures are presented on pages 31-37. descriptions of the excluded items appear on pages 24-26.
business overview air products and chemicals, inc. is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 75 years. the company's core industrial gases business provides atmospheric and process gases and related equipment to manufacturing markets, including refining and petrochemical, metals, electronics, and food and beverage. air products is also the world's leading supplier of liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment. with operations in 50 countries, in 2017 we had sales of $8.2 billion, total company assets, including assets of both continuing and discontinued operations, of $18.5 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 15,300 full- and part-time employees from continuing and discontinued operations.
as of 30 september 2017, our operations were organized into five reportable business segments: industrial gases - americas; industrial gases - emea (europe, middle east, and africa); industrial gases - asia; industrial gases - global; and corporate and other. the financial statements and analysis that follow discuss our results based on these operations. refer to note 25, business segment and geographic information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.
2017 in summary in 2017, we were able to focus on our core industrial gases business by completing the separation of emd through the spin-off of versum materials, inc. (versum) and the sale of pmd to evonik industries ag (evonik). sales of $8.2 billion increased nine percent over the prior year, primarily due to volume growth from new project onstreams across our regional industrial gases businesses, underlying growth in the base business, and continued progress on the jazan project within our industrial gases - global segment, partially offset by weaker liquefied natural gas (lng) equipment sales. we delivered operating margin of 17.4%, adjusted operating margin of 21.6%, and adjusted ebitda margin of 34.1% as our productivity actions were offset by the impact of energy cost pass-through to customers. diluted eps of $5.16 increased 2% from the prior year. on a non-gaap basis, adjusted diluted eps of $6.31 increased 12%.
•   adjusted ebitda of $2,795.0 increased 7%, or $173.5. adjusted ebitda margin of 34.1% decreased 80 bp and was negatively impacted by 90 bp from higher contractual energy pass-through to customers. excluding this impact, adjusted ebitda margin was up 10 bp.
•   we entered into an agreement to form a $1.3 billion joint venture in china with lu'an clean energy company.

2018 outlook in 2018, we intend to build on our strong fiscal year 2017 operating results through a combination of base business growth, new project onstreams, and productivity benefits. we expect lower income from transition services agreements to be offset by cost reductions associated with these services. our recent portfolio actions, including the spin-off of versum and the sale pmd, and improved operating results have positioned us with a strong balance sheet and the opportunity to invest in our core industrial gases business to drive future growth and create shareholder value.
the above guidance should be read in conjunction with the section entitled "forward-looking statements."
equity affiliates' income                   80.1             147.0             152.3
non-gaap measures adjusted ebitda                         $2,795.0          $2,621.5          $2,399.4
adjusted ebitda margin                      34.1   %          34.9   %          30.7   %
adjusted equity affiliates' income         159.6             147.0             152.3
sales of $8,187.6 increased 9%, or $683.9. underlying sales increased 7% from higher volumes of 6% and higher pricing of 1%. higher volumes, primarily due to new project onstreams, underlying base business growth across the industrial gases regions, and continued progress on the jazan project within our industrial gases - global segment, were partially offset by lower lng project activity in the corporate and other segment. the pricing improvement was primarily attributable to the industrial gases - asia segment. higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers increased sales by 3%, and unfavorable currency effects reduced sales by 1%.
operating income of $1,427.6 decreased 7%, or $102.1, as a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $162, higher cost reduction and asset actions of $117, unfavorable currency impacts of $9, and higher pension settlement losses of $5 were partially offset by favorable volumes of $83, favorable net operating costs of $69, lower business separation costs of $20, a gain on the sale of land of $12, and favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs, of $7. net operating costs were lower primarily due to benefits from cost reduction actions and higher other income. operating margin of 17.4% decreased 300 bp, primarily due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge and higher cost reduction and asset actions.
operating income of $1,529.7 increased 24%, or $296.5, as lower operating costs of $235, lower business restructuring and cost reduction actions of $146, favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs, of $33, and lower pension settlement losses of $14 were partially offset by higher business separation costs of $43, unfavorable currency impacts of $35, and lower volumes of $2. in addition, fiscal year 2015 included a gain on land sales of $34 and a gain of $18 on a previously held equity interest. operating costs decreased due to benefits from our cost reduction actions of $115, lower pension expense of $33, lower maintenance expense of $37, and lower other costs of $50.
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as income from continuing operations (including noncontrolling interests) excluding certain disclosed items, which the company does not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non‐operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. adjusted ebitda provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance.
adjusted ebitda of $2,795.0 increased $173.5, or 7%, primarily due to higher volumes and favorable cost performance. adjusted ebitda margin of 34.1% decreased 80 bp, primarily due to a 90 bp impact from higher energy pass-through to customers.
adjusted ebitda of $2,621.5 increased $222.1, or 9%, primarily due to favorable costs and favorable pricing, net of energy, fuel, and raw material costs. adjusted ebitda margin of 34.9% increased 420 bp.
equity affiliates' income
income from equity affiliates of $80.1 decreased $66.9, primarily due to a noncash impairment charge of $79.5 ($.36 per share) on our investment in abdullah hashim industrial gases & equipment co., ltd. (ahg), a 25%‐owned equity affiliate in our industrial gases - emea segment. this charge has been excluded from segment results. on a non-gaap basis, adjusted equity affiliates' income of $159.6 increased 9%, or $12.6.
refer to note 8, summarized financial information of equity affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge.
income from equity affiliates of $147.0 decreased $5.3, as lower income from industrial gases - americas and industrial gases - emea affiliates was partially offset by higher income from industrial gases - asia affiliates.
cost of sales of $5,176.6 decreased $421.6, or 8%, primarily due to lower energy costs of $271, a favorable currency impact of $192, and lower operating costs of $148, partially offset by higher costs attributable to sales volumes of $189. operating costs included favorable impacts from cost reduction actions of $48, lower maintenance costs of $37, lower pension expense of $21, as well as the benefits of other operational improvements and productivity. costs associated with volumes were higher primarily due to the jazan sale of equipment activity.
selling and administrative expense of $715.6 increased $30.6, or 4%, primarily due to costs in support of transition services agreements with versum and evonik, for which the reimbursement is reflected in "other income (expense), net." selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 8.7% from 9.1%.
selling and administrative expense of $685.0 decreased $88.0, or 11%, primarily due to the benefits of cost reduction actions of $59 and favorable currency effects of $27. selling and administrative expense as a percent of sales decreased to 9.1% from 9.9%.
business separation costs in connection with the disposition of emd and pmd, we incurred separation costs of $30.2 ($26.5 after-tax, or $.12 per share), $50.6 ($46.7 after-tax, or $.21 per share), and $7.5 ($.03 per share) in fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. these costs are reflected on the consolidated income statements as "business separation costs" and include legal, advisory, and pension related costs.
our fiscal year 2017 income tax provision includes net tax benefits of $5.5 ($.02 per share) primarily related to changes in tax positions on business separation activities. our fiscal year 2016 income tax provision includes additional tax expense related to the separation of $51.8 ($.24 per share), of which $45.7 resulted from a dividend that was declared in june 2016 to repatriate $443.8 from a subsidiary in south korea to the u.s. in anticipation of the separation of emd from the industrial gases business in south korea.
refer to note 3, discontinued operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the dispositions.
business restructuring and cost reduction actions we recorded charges in fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015 for business restructuring and cost reduction actions. the charges for these actions are excluded from segment operating income. refer to note 5, business restructuring and cost reduction actions, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these actions.
cost reduction actions in fiscal year 2017, we recognized a net expense of $151.4 ($109.3 attributable to air products, after-tax, or $.49 per share), of which $154.8 related to actions taken during the current year, partially offset by the favorable settlement of the remaining $3.4 accrued balance associated with prior business restructuring actions. asset actions totaled $88.5 and included charges resulting from the write‐down of an air separation unit in the industrial gases - emea segment that was constructed mainly to provide oxygen to one of the energy‐from‐waste plants, the planned sale of a non-industrial gas hardgoods business in the industrial gases - americas segment, and the closure of a facility in the corporate and other segment that manufactured lng heat exchangers. severance and other benefits totaled $66.3 and related to the elimination or planned elimination of approximately 625 positions, primarily in the corporate and other segment and in the industrial gases - emea segment. the actions in the corporate and other segment were driven by the reorganization of our engineering, manufacturing, and technology functions.
in fiscal year 2016, we recognized an expense of $34.5 ($24.7 after-tax, or $.11 per share) for severance and other benefits related to cost reduction actions which resulted in the elimination of approximately 610 positions. the expenses related primarily to the industrial gases - americas segment and the industrial gases - emea segment.
business realignment and reorganization in fiscal year 2015, we recognized an expense of $180.1 ($132.9 after-tax, or $.61 per share). severance and other benefits totaled $131.5 and related to the elimination of approximately 1,700 positions. asset and associated contract actions totaled $48.6 and related primarily to a plant shutdown in the corporate and other segment and the exit of a product line within the industrial gases - global segment.
pension settlement loss certain of our pension plans provide for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after their retirement date. a participant's vested benefit is considered settled upon cash payment of the lump sum. we recognize pension settlement losses when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost of the plan for the fiscal year. we recognized pension settlement losses of $10.5 ($6.6 after-tax, or $.03 per share), $5.1 ($3.3 after-tax, or $.02 per share), and $19.3 ($12.4 after-tax, or $.06 per share) in fiscal year 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, to accelerate recognition of a portion of actuarial losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss, primarily associated with the u.s. supplementary pension plan.
goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we determined that the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily acquired trade names) associated with our latin america reporting unit of our industrial gases - americas segment were impaired. we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $162.1 ($154.1 attributable to air products, after-tax, or $.70 per share), which was driven by lower economic growth and profitability in the region. refer to note 10, goodwill, and note 11, intangible assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
gain on previously held equity interest on 30 december 2014, we acquired our partner's equity ownership interest in a liquefied atmospheric industrial gases production joint venture in north america for $22.6, which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. the transaction was accounted for as a business combination, and subsequent to the acquisition, the results were consolidated within our industrial gases - americas segment. we recorded a gain of $17.9 ($11.2 after-tax, or $.05 per share) as a result of revaluing our previously held equity interest to fair value as of the acquisition date. refer to note 6, business combination, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
other income (expense), net items recorded to other income (expense), net arise from transactions and events not directly related to our principal income earning activities. the detail of other income (expense), net is presented in note 23, supplemental information, to the consolidated financial statements.
other income (expense), net of $121.0 increased $71.6, primarily due to income from transition services agreements with versum and evonik, income from the sale of assets and investments, including a gain of $12.2 ($7.6 after-tax, or $.03 per share) resulting from the sale of a parcel of land, and a favorable foreign exchange impact.
other income (expense), net of $49.4 increased $3.9, primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses, favorable contract settlements, and receipt of a government subsidy. fiscal year 2015 included a gain of $33.6 ($28.3 after‐tax, or $.13 per share) resulting from the sale of two parcels of land. no other individual items were significant in comparison to fiscal year 2015.
less: capitalized interest        19.0            32.7            49.1
interest incurred decreased $8.3 as the impact from a lower average debt balance of $26 was partially offset by the impact from a higher average interest rate on the debt portfolio of $19. the change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in the carrying value of projects under construction, primarily as a result of our decision to exit from the energy-from-waste business.
interest incurred decreased $4.0. the decrease primarily resulted from a stronger u.s. dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest of $6, partially offset by a higher average debt balance of $2. the change in capitalized interest was driven by a decrease in the carrying value of projects under construction, primarily as a result of our exit from the energy-from-waste business.
other non-operating income (expense), net other non-operating income (expense), net of $29.0 in fiscal year 2017 primarily resulted from interest income on cash and time deposits, which are comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of pmd. interest income was included in "other income (expense), net" in 2016 and 2015. interest income in previous periods was not material.
loss on extinguishment of debt on 30 september 2016, in anticipation of the spin-off of emd, versum issued $425.0 of notes to air products, who then exchanged these notes with certain financial institutions for $418.3 of air products' outstanding commercial paper. this noncash exchange, which was excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows, resulted in a loss of $6.9 ($4.3 after-tax, or $.02 per share).
the effective tax rate was 18.4% and 27.8% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the current year rate included an impact of approximately 700 bp from a net income tax benefit resulting from a tax election related to a non-u.s. subsidiary and an impact of approximately 100 bp from excess tax benefits on share-based compensation resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. these impacts were partially offset by an increase of approximately 200 bp due to both a goodwill impairment charge in our latin america reporting unit and an impairment of an equity method investment for which no tax benefits were available. the 2016 rate included a 330 bp impact from tax costs associated with business separation, primarily resulting from a dividend declared in 2016 to repatriate cash from a foreign subsidiary as discussed above under business separation costs. the remaining change was primarily due to the impact of business separation costs for which a tax benefit was estimated to not be available. on a non-gaap basis, the adjusted effective tax rate decreased from 24.2% in 2016 to 23.2% in 2017, primarily due to excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. refer to note 2, new accounting guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our adoption of the share-based compensation accounting guidance.
the effective tax rate was 27.8% and 23.7% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the change included a 330 bp impact from tax costs associated with business separation, primarily resulting from a dividend declared in 2016 to repatriate cash from a foreign subsidiary as discussed above under business separation costs. the remaining 80 bp change was primarily due to the increase in mix of income in jurisdictions with a higher effective tax rate and the impact of business separation costs for which a tax benefit was estimated to not be available. on a non-gaap basis, the adjusted effective tax rate increased from 24.0% in 2015 to 24.2% in 2016, primarily due to the increase in and mix of income in jurisdictions with a higher effective tax rate.
discontinued operations the results of our former materials technologies segment and the former energy-from-waste segment have been presented as discontinued operations. refer to note 3, discontinued operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information, including detail of the major line items that comprise income from discontinued operations, net of tax, on the consolidated income statements for the fiscal years ended 30 september 2017, 2016, and 2015.
materials technologies on 16 september 2015, we announced plans to separate our materials technologies segment, which contained emd and pmd. on 1 october 2016, we completed the separation of emd through the spin-off of versum. on 3 january 2017, we completed the sale of pmd to evonik for $3.8 billion in cash. a gain of $2,870 ($1,828 after-tax, or $8.32 per share) was recognized on the sale. as a result of the dispositions, both emd and pmd are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
energy-from-waste on 29 march 2016, the board of directors approved the company's exit of its energy‐from‐waste (efw) business and efforts to start up and operate the two efw projects located in tees valley, united kingdom, were discontinued. since that time, the efw segment has been presented as a discontinued operation. our fiscal year 2016 loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, includes a loss on disposal of $945.7 ($846.6 after-tax) recorded to write down plant assets to their estimated net realizable value and record a liability for plant disposition and other costs.
during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we determined that it is unlikely for a buyer to assume the remaining assets and contract obligations, including land lease obligations. as a result, we recorded an additional loss of $59.3 ($47.1 after-tax) in results of discontinued operations, of which $53.0 was recorded primarily for land lease obligations and $6.3 was recorded to update our estimate of the net realizable value of the plant assets as of 31 december 2016. there have been no changes to our estimates during the remainder of fiscal year 2017. we may incur additional exit costs in future periods related to other outstanding commitments.

sales of $236.0 decreased $79.4, or 25%, primarily due to lower lng sale of equipment activity. operating loss of $87.6 increased 1%, or $1.1, due to lower lng activity, mostly offset by benefits from our recent cost reduction actions and lower foreign exchange losses.
the company has presented certain financial measures on a non-gaap ("adjusted") basis and has provided a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap. these financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap. the company believes these non-gaap measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful supplemental information to evaluate the performance of the business because such measures, when viewed together with our financial results computed in accordance with gaap, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results.
in many cases, our non-gaap measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to exclude certain disclosed items ("non-gaap adjustments") that we believe are not representative of the underlying business performance. for example, air products has executed its strategic plan to restructure the company to focus on its core industrial gases business. this resulted in significant cost reduction and asset actions that we believe are important for investors to understand separately from the performance of the underlying business. the reader should be aware that we may incur similar expenses in the future. the tax impact of our non-gaap adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax expense impact of the transactions and is impacted primarily by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions. investors should also consider the limitations associated with these non-gaap measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.

liquidity and capital resources we maintained a strong financial position throughout 2017 and as of 30 september 2017 our consolidated balance sheet included cash and cash items of $3,273.6. the cash and cash items balance is higher than our historical trend and primarily results from the sale of pmd to evonik on 3 january 2017. we continue to have consistent access to commercial paper markets, and cash flows from operating and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
as of 30 september 2017, we had $1,530.2 of foreign cash and cash items compared to a total amount of cash and cash items of $3,273.6. if the foreign cash and cash items are needed for operations in the u.s. or we otherwise elect to repatriate the funds, we may be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes on a significant portion of these amounts. however, since we have significant current investment plans outside the u.s., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items outside the u.s. current financing alternatives do not require the repatriation of foreign funds.
our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities from continuing operations, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:
operating activities                 $2,534.1              $2,258.8              $2,047.0

for the year ended 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $2,258.8. income from continuing operations of $1,099.5 included a loss on extinguishment of debt of $6.9. other adjustments of $156.7 were primarily driven by the remeasurement of intercompany transactions as the related hedging instruments that eliminate the earnings impact are included in other receivables and payables and accrued liabilities. the working capital accounts were a source of cash of $21.2 that were primarily driven by payables and accrued liabilities and inventory partially offset by trade receivables and other working capital. the increase in payables and accrued liabilities of $60.1 was primarily related to an increase in customer advances which includes payment from our joint venture in jazan, saudi arabia and was partially offset by the changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that hedge intercompany loans. the use of cash from other working capital of $47.8 was primarily driven by advances associated with the purchase of helium partially offset by an increase in accrued income taxes, including the impacts of higher income.
for the year ended 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $2,047.0. income from continuing operations of $933.3 included the write-down of long-lived assets associated with business restructuring of $40.2, a noncash gain on the previously held equity interest of $17.9, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $16.6. other adjustments included pension and postretirement expense of $120.1 and contributions to our pension plans of $137.5, primarily for plans in the u.s. and u.k. management considers various factors when making pension funding decisions, including tax, cash flow, and regulatory implications. the working capital accounts were a source of cash of $256.0. the increase of payables and accrued liabilities of $134.9 includes an increase in accrued incentive compensation of $72.7.

for the year ended 30 september 2015, cash used for investing activities was $1,146.7, primarily capital expenditures for plant and equipment. on 30 december 2014, we acquired our partner's equity ownership interest in a liquefied atmospheric industrial gases production joint venture in north america which increased our ownership from 50% to 100%. refer to note 6, business combination, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
capital expenditures capital expenditures are detailed in the following table:

(a)   we utilize a non-gaap measure in the computation of capital expenditures and include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows within "cash provided by operating activities" if the arrangement qualifies as a capital lease. additionally, the purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests is accounted for as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. the presentation of this non-gaap measure is intended to enhance the usefulness of information by providing a measure that our management uses internally to evaluate and manage our expenditures.
capital expenditures on a gaap basis in 2017 totaled $1,056.0, compared to $907.7 in 2016. the increase of $148.3 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures on facility improvement projects and major project spending. additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. spending in 2017 and 2016 included plant and equipment constructed to provide oxygen and nitrogen for coal to liquid fuel in china, hydrogen to global markets, oxygen to the steel industry, and nitrogen for the electronics industry.
capital expenditures on a non-gaap basis in 2017 totaled $1,065.9 compared to $934.9 in 2016. the increase of $131.0 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures on facility improvement projects and major project spending partially offset by lower capital lease expenditures.
on 19 april 2015, a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco's oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan, saudi arabia. air products owns 25% of the joint venture. during 2016 and 2015, we recorded noncash transactions which resulted in an increase of $26.9 and $67.5, respectively, to our investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates for our obligation to invest in the joint venture. these noncash transactions were excluded from the consolidated statements of cash flows and there was no impact in 2017. in total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. air products has also entered into a sale of equipment contract with the joint venture to engineer, procure, and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply the gases to saudi aramco.
2018 outlook capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2018 are expected to be approximately $1,000 to $1,200. this range excludes possible acquisitions and our previously announced agreement to form a joint venture, air products lu'an (changzhi) co., ltd., with lu'an clean energy company that will build, own and operate four large air separation units as discussed in the contractual obligations section on page 43. a majority of the total capital expenditures is expected to be for new plants that are currently under construction or expected to start construction. it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. in addition, we intend to continue to evaluate acquisitions of small and medium size industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies; the purchase of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts where we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and investment in very large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth.

contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. we had $655 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 september 2017, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 september 2017. variable interest rates are primarily determined by u.s. short-term tax-exempt interest rates and by interbank offer rates.
leases refer to note 12, leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases.
pension obligations the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities, less the net pension liability transferred to discontinued operations. refer to note 16, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment.
the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions.
unconditional purchase obligations approximately $5,600 of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium purchases, which include crude feedstock supply to multiple helium refining plants in north america as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world. as a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector, these helium sourcing agreements are medium- to long-term and contain take-or-pay provisions. the refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas, primarily under medium-term requirements contracts. while contract terms in the energy sector are longer than those in merchant, helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties.
approximately $280 of our long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. however, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations, which are primarily pass-through contracts with our customers.
purchase commitments to spend approximately $300 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2018. in addition, we have purchase commitments totaling approximately $180 in 2018 relating to our long-term sale of equipment project for saudi aramco's jazan oil refinery.
we also purchase materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices.
obligation for future contribution to an equity affiliate on 19 april 2015, a joint venture between air products and acwa holding entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply saudi aramco's oil refinery and power plant being built in jazan, saudi arabia. air products owns 25% of the joint venture and guarantees the repayment of its share of an equity bridge loan. in total, we expect to invest approximately $100 in this joint venture. as of 30 september 2017 and 2016, we recorded a noncurrent liability of $94.4 for our obligation to make future equity contributions in 2020 based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan.
investment in joint venture on 10 september 2017, air products signed an agreement to form a joint venture, air products lu'an (changzhi) co., ltd., with lu'an clean energy company. air products has already invested $300 million to build, own, and operate four large air separation units to supply the changzhi city site. under the agreement, air products will contribute the air separation units and invest an additional $500. air products will own 60% of the joint venture and will consolidate its financial results. closing will occur upon the completion of initial operational start-up and government and regulatory approvals. due to the uncertainty of those milestones, the additional investment has been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.
income tax liabilities noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 september 2017 were $778.4. tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 september 2017 were $146.4. these tax liabilities were excluded from the contractual obligations table as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year given that payments will vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates, and our operating results. in addition, there are uncertainties in timing of the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions with respective taxing authorities. refer to note 22, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
pension benefits the company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. the principal defined benefit pension plans are the u.s. salaried pension plan and the u.k. pension plan. these plans were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.
the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 september 2017 measurement date increased to $4,409.2 from $4,116.4 at the end of fiscal year 2016. the projected benefit obligation for these plans was $5,107.1 and $5,327.3 at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. the net unfunded liability decreased by approximately $513 from $1,211 to $698, primarily due to higher discount rates, favorable asset experience and the effects of the versum spin-off and the sale of pmd to evonik. refer to note 16, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits.
(a)   effective in 2016, the company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs. the company accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it prospectively. this change did not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation.
pension expense, excluding special items, increased from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate offset by favorable asset experience. special items of $15.0 included pension settlement losses of $10.5 related to the u.s. supplementary pension plan, curtailment and special termination benefits of $4.5, $2.5 of which was reflected in "business separation costs" and $2.0 reflected in "business restructuring and cost reduction actions" on the consolidated income statements.
pension expense, excluding special items, decreased from fiscal year 2015 due to the adoption of the spot rate approach, which reduced service cost and interest cost, and the impacts from expected return on assets and demographic gains, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans. special items of $6.0 included pension settlement losses of $5.1, special termination benefits of $2.0, and curtailment gains of $1.1. these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions.
2018 outlook in 2018, pension expense, excluding special items, is expected to be relatively flat compared to 2017 with a range of approximately $50 to $55. this results from lower loss amortization primarily due to favorable asset experience, offset by the impact of lower discount rates and a lower expected return on assets. pension settlement losses of $5 to $10 are expected, depending on the timing of retirements. in 2018, we expect pension expense to include approximately $128 for amortization of actuarial losses. in 2017, total company pension expense, which includes both continuing and discontinued operations, included amortization of actuarial losses of $143. net actuarial losses of $352 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2017. actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2018.
as noted in note 2, new accounting guidance, to the consolidated financial statements, we expect to early adopt guidance on the presentation of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost in 2018. the amendments require that the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost be presented in the same line items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by employees during the period. the other components of net periodic benefit cost will be presented outside of operating income.
pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. with respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.
in addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. with the assistance of third party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. during 2017 and 2016, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $64.1 and $79.3, respectively.
for 2018, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $50 to $70. the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements and future cost reduction actions. actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. refer to the contractual obligations discussion on pages 41-43 for a projection of future contributions.
environmental matters we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations. compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. in the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (cercla: the federal superfund law); resource conservation and recovery act (rcra); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note 1, major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note 17, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.
the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $11.4, $12.2, and $11.8 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards. future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. refer to note 17, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
although precise amounts are difficult to determine, we estimate that we spent $7 in 2017, $3 in 2016, and $2 in 2015 on capital projects to control pollution. capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $3 in both 2018 and 2019.
we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $83 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $97 as of 30 september 2017. the consolidated balance sheets at 30 september 2017 and 2016 included an accrual of $83.6 and $81.4, respectively. the accrual for the environmental obligations includes amounts for the pace, florida; piedmont, south carolina;
and pasadena, texas, locations which were a part of previously divested chemicals businesses. refer to note 17, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities.
actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year.
some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases ("ghg"), including carbon dioxide. these include existing coverage under the european union emission trading scheme, california and ontario cap and trade schemes, alberta's specified gas emitters regulation, china's emission trading scheme pilots, south korea's emission trading scheme, and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions under an ontario cap and trade scheme, nation-wide expansion of the china emission trading scheme, and revisions to the alberta regulation. in addition, the u.s. environmental protection agency ("epa") requires mandatory reporting of ghg emissions and is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs.
increased public concern may result in more international, u.s. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg. although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power and hydrogen production. we believe it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.
regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us. we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. we are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from steam methane reforming, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. in addition, the potential demand for clean coal could increase demand for oxygen, one of our main products, and our proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note 17, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. our off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
related party transactions our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating in the industrial gas business. in 2015, we entered into a long-term sale of equipment contract to engineer, procure, and construct industrial gas facilities with a 25%‐owned joint venture for saudi aramco's jazan oil refinery and power plant in saudi arabia. the agreement included terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm's length with an independent party. sales related to this contract are included in the results of our industrial gases - global segment and were approximately $540 and $300 during fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively. sales related to this contract were not material during fiscal year 2015.
inflation we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis.
critical accounting policies and estimates note 1, major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies. judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas. however, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management's significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee.
depreciable lives of plant and equipment net plant and equipment at 30 september 2017 totaled $8,440.2, and depreciation expense totaled $843.2 during 2017. plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.
economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. for example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. in these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.
the regional industrial gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer's facility. these contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. as contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.
our regional industrial gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. the depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors' actions, etc. management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change.
a change in the weighted average remaining depreciable life by one year for assets associated with our regional industrial gases segments would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below:
impairment of assets plant and equipment plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.
if such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. if an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group's fair value and its carrying value. an estimate of the asset group's fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. assets that meet the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
the assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. the assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management's best estimates at the time of the impairment review. changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.
on 29 march 2016, the board of directors approved the company's exit of its energy-from-waste business. accordingly, we assessed the recoverability of capital costs for the two projects associated with this business and recorded an impairment charge to the results of discontinued operations of $913.5 to reduce the carrying values of plant assets to their estimated net realizable value. we estimated the net realizable value of the projects assuming an orderly liquidation of assets capable of being marketed on a secondary equipment market based on market quotes and our experience with selling similar equipment. an asset's orderly liquidation value is the amount that could be realized from a liquidation sale, given a reasonable period of time to find a buyer, selling the asset in the existing condition where it is located, and assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. the valuation includes inputs that are unobservable and therefore considered level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. the loss was measured as the difference between the orderly liquidation value of the assets and the net book value of the assets. during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we recorded an additional loss of $6.3 to update our estimate of the net realizable value of the plant assets as of 31 december 2016 of $11.0. in addition, a charge of $45.7 was recorded to continuing operations to write-down the air separation unit in the industrials gases-emea segment that was constructed mainly to provide oxygen to one of the energy-from-waste plants to its net realizable value of $1.4. there have been no changes to our estimates during the remainder of 2017. refer to note 3, discontinued operations, and note 5, business restructuring and cost reduction actions, for additional information.
in the third quarter of 2017, we performed interim impairment testing of our latin america reporting unit (lasa) long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, as of 30 june 2017. see the discussions below under goodwill and intangible assets on 2017 impairment testing. we also tested the recoverability of lasa's long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, and concluded that they were recoverable from expected future undiscounted cash flows.
goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. goodwill was $721.5 as of 30 september 2017. disclosures related to goodwill are included in note 10, goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements.
we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for more frequent testing. the tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. we have five business segments and eleven reporting units. reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each business segment. the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the three regional industrial gases segments.
as part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a quantitative test is required. we chose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing, as further described below.
as described in note 2, new accounting guidance, to the consolidated financial statements, we elected to early adopt the new accounting guidance which simplified the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating step 2, which measured the impairment loss based on the fair value of goodwill. under the new guidance, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. the income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or ebitda margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or ebitda assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. the discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates.
if our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. when the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. when both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.
2017 impairment testing for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, volumes declined in our latin america reporting unit (lasa), and overall revenue growth did not meet expectations. due to weak economic conditions in latin america and expectations for continued volume weakness in the latin american countries and markets in which we operate, we lowered our long-term growth projections for lasa by more than 200 basis points, which also unfavorably impacted our ebitda margin. management considered the revised projections for lasa to be indicators of potential impairment and, accordingly, performed interim impairment testing of our long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, as of 30 june 2017 utilizing the revised projections. lasa represents approximately 6% of the company's total revenue with business units in chile, colombia, and other latin america countries.
we estimated the fair value of lasa as of 30 june 2017 based on two valuation approaches, the income approach and the market approach, as described above. we reviewed relevant facts and circumstances in determining the weighting of the approaches. under the income approach, we estimated the fair value of lasa based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and ebitda margins, taking into consideration business and market conditions for the latin american countries and markets in which we operate. these estimates were consistent with our revised forecast and long-term financial planning processes, which included a reduction in sales growth by more than 200 basis points from that previously identified. we calculated the discount rate based on a market-participant, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which considers industry-specific rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure, adjusted for risks associated with business size and geography. under the market approach, we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publicly-traded industrial gases companies and regional manufacturing companies, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects.
based on the results of the valuations, we determined that the goodwill associated with lasa was impaired and recorded a noncash impairment charge of $145.3, the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value, during the third quarter of 2017. this impairment is reflected on our consolidated income statements within "goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge." this charge was not deductible for tax purposes and has been excluded from segment operating income.
during the fourth quarter of 2017, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment testing. we determined that the fair value of all our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value except lasa, for which the fair value equaled the carrying value.
the excess of fair value over carrying value for our reporting units other than lasa ranged from approximately 80% to approximately 350%. management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of these reporting units. in this scenario, the fair value of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying value by a range of approximately 60% to 300%.
as of 30 september 2017, the carrying value of latin america goodwill was $67.3, or less than 1% of consolidated total assets. further events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting unit include but are not limited to a decline in market share, pricing pressures, and further economic weakening in the markets we serve. revenue growth and ebitda margin assumptions are two primary drivers of the fair value of lasa. we determined that, with other assumptions held constant, a decrease in revenue growth rates of approximately 125 basis points or a decrease in ebitda margin of approximately 225 basis points would result in an impairment of the remaining goodwill balance. the carrying value of lasa's other material assets at 30 september 2017 included: plant and equipment, net of $345.3; customer relationships of $166.3; and trade names and trademarks of $46.9. the trade names and trademarks are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets.
future events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.
intangible assets intangible assets with determinable lives at 30 september 2017 totaled $321.4 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. see the impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined.
indefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 september 2017 totaled $46.9 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. if the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. to determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.
2017 impairment testing in the third quarter of 2017, we conducted an interim impairment test and determined that the carrying value of the lasa indefinite-lived intangible assets was impaired. we determined that the carrying value of trade names and trademarks was in excess of fair value, and as a result, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $16.8 to reduce these indefinite-lived intangible assets to their fair value. this impairment is reflected on our consolidated income statements within "goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge"
in the fourth quarter of 2017, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles and found no indications of impairment.
equity investments investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,286.9 at 30 september 2017. the majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note 8, summarized financial information of equity affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other‐than‐temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. management's estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. we utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach. for the market approach, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies. changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.
during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, abdullah hashim industrial gases & equipment co., ltd. (ahg), a 25%‐owned equity affiliate in our industrial gases - emea segment, completed a review of its business plan and outlook. as a result of the revised business plan, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in ahg and, therefore, recorded a noncash impairment charge of $79.5 to reduce the carrying value of our investment. this charge is reflected on our consolidated income statements within "equity affiliates' income" and was not deductible for tax purposes.
the decline in value results from expectations for lower future cash flows to be generated by ahg, primarily due to challenging economic conditions in saudi arabia, including the impacts of lower prices in the oil and gas industry, increased competition, and capital project growth opportunities not materializing as anticipated. the ahg investment was valued based on the results of the income and market valuation approaches.
the income approach utilized a discount rate based on a market-participant, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which considers industry required rates of return on debt and equity capital for a target industry capital structure adjusted for risks associated with size and geography. other significant estimates and assumptions that drive our updated valuation of ahg include revenue growth rates and profit margins that were lower than those upon acquisition and our assessment of ahg's business improvement plan effectiveness.
as of 30 september 2017, the carrying value of our investment in ahg is $66.7 and is reflected in our industrial gases - emea segment. the investment is reported in "investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates" on our consolidated balance sheets.
revenue recognition - percentage-of-completion method revenue from equipment sale contracts is recorded primarily using the percentage-of-completion method. under this method, revenue from the sale of major equipment, such as liquefied natural gas (lng) heat exchangers and large air separation units, is recognized based on costs or labor hours incurred to date compared with total estimated costs or labor hours to be incurred. we estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete the contract and recognize the profit over the life of the contract.
accounting for contracts using the percentage-of-completion method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule and technical issues, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. when adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs or labor hours are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
our jazan large air separation unit sale of equipment project within our industrial gases - global segment spans several years. in addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and
construction activities, this project requires monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract.
we assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. at 30 september 2017, accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to $98.6 and $603.9, respectively. tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 september 2017 were $146.4, excluding interest and penalties. income tax expense for the year ended 30 september 2017 was $260.9. disclosures related to income taxes are included in note 22, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements.
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.
deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. however, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans.
actuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. we determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. note 16, retirement benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. mortality rates are based on the most recent society of actuaries tables. we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. however, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover.
one of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. effective in 2016, the company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows, as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs. the company accounted for this as a change in accounting
estimate and, accordingly accounted for it on a prospective basis. this change did not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation. the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. this rate changes from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. a 50 bp increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $36 per year.
the expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. in determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans' liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. a 50 bp increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $19 per year.
we use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. the expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. for equities, this is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses in fair value related to equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. the market-related value for fixed income investments equals the actual fair value. expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.
loss contingencies in the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies (i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us). we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. when only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.
contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in note 1, major accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in note 17, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. for example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or our proportionate share is increased. similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.
new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted guidance requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt instead of as a separate deferred asset. the guidance resulted in a reclassification adjustment that decreased other noncurrent assets by $17.0 with a corresponding decrease to long-term debt as of 30 september 2016. we have elected to continue to present debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit arrangement as a deferred asset, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings.
in addition, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we adopted guidance that simplified the accounting for employee share-based payments. the new guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be
recognized in the income statement rather than in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. as a result of applying this change prospectively, we recognized $17.6 of excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes during fiscal year 2017. adoption of this guidance resulted in the presentation of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than a financing activity. we applied these presentation changes retrospectively to all periods presented.
in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we elected to early adopt guidance which simplified the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating step 2, which measured the impairment loss based on the fair value of goodwill. under the new guidance, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. refer to note 10, goodwill, for a discussion of our interim and annual goodwill impairment tests.

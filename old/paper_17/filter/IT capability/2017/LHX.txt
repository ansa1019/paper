item 1a.   risk factors.
we have described many of the trends and other factors that we believe could impact our business and future results in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this report. in addition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to, and could be materially adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results.
we depend on u.s. government customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in u.s. government funding or a change in u.s. government spending priorities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are highly dependent on sales to u.s. government customers. the percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 74 percent, 77 percent and 66 percent, respectively. therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the u.s. government would significantly reduce our revenue. our competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the
u.s. government and will continue these efforts in the future, and the u.s. government may choose to use other contractors. we expect that a majority of the business that we seek will be awarded through competitive bidding. the u.s. government has increasingly relied on certain types of contracts that are subject to multiple competitive bidding processes, including multi-vendor idiq, gwac, general services administration schedule and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. we operate in highly competitive markets, many of our competitors having greater financial resources than we do, and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas, and we may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain task orders under multi-award contracts. further, the competitive bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors, as well as the risk that we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill any contract awarded to us. the current competitive environment has resulted in unsuccessful bidders more frequently initiating bid protests. following any contract award, we may experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding. our u.s. government programs must compete with programs managed by other government contractors and with other policy imperatives for consideration for limited resources and for uncertain levels of funding during the budget and appropriations process. budget and appropriations decisions made by the u.s. government are outside of our control and have long-term consequences for our business. u.s. government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration (automatic, across-the-board u.s. government budgetary spending cuts) and potential alternative funding arrangements. a change in u.s. government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs, or a reduction in total u.s. government spending, could have material adverse consequences on our current or future business. the inability of the u.s. government to pass a budget, potentially leading to a "continuing resolution" (flat funding levels) or to a u.s. government shutdown, also could have material adverse consequences on our current or future business. for more information regarding sequestration, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - business considerations - industry-wide opportunities, challenges and risks" of this report.
we depend significantly on u.s. government contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. the termination or failure to fund, or negative audit findings for, one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
over its lifetime, a u.s. government program may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts. the funding of u.s. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations. although multi-year contracts may be authorized and appropriated in connection with major procurements, congress generally appropriates funds on a government fiscal year basis. procurement funds are typically made available for obligation over the course of one to three years. consequently, programs often receive only partial funding initially, and additional funds are obligated only as congress authorizes further appropriations. the termination of funding for a u.s. government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. in addition, the termination of a program or the failure to commit additional funds to a program that already has been started could result in lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.
generally, u.s. government contracts are subject to oversight audits by u.s. government representatives. such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. we have recorded contract revenue based on costs we expect to realize upon final audit. however, we do not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenue or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.
in addition, u.s. government contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the u.s. government's convenience upon payment only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. we can give no assurance that one or more of our u.s. government contracts will not be terminated under these circumstances. also, we can give no assurance that we would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of our u.s. government contracts. because a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under our u.s. government contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our government business also is subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socioeconomic and other requirements. these requirements, although customary in u.s. government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. these costs might increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. failure to comply with these regulations and
requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from u.s. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, u.s. government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. the termination of a u.s. government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future u.s. government contracts.
we could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, or other significant disruption of our it networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers.
we face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach, whether through cyber attack or cyber intrusion over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or with access to systems inside our organization, or other significant disruption of our it networks and related systems. we face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption of the it networks and related systems that we develop, install, operate and maintain for certain of our customers, which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions or personally identifiable or protected health information. the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. as an advanced technology-based solutions provider, and particularly as a government contractor, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers' proprietary or classified information on our it networks and related systems and to the it networks and related systems that we operate and maintain for certain of our customers. these types of information and it networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and it networks and related systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. in some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks due to the nature of our business and the industries in which we operate. accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. a security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and it networks and related systems could:
•   disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and, therefore, our operations and/or those of certain of our customers;
•   result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours, our customers or our employees, including trade secrets, which could be used to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;
•   compromise national security and other sensitive government functions;
•   require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result;
•   subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and
•   damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the u.s. government) and the public generally.
any or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the u.s. government's budget deficit, the national debt and sequestration could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the u.s. government's budget deficit, the national debt and sequestration could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in a number of ways, including the following:
•   the u.s. government could reduce or delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, the government programs in which we participate;
•   the u.s. government may be unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year on september 30 and thus would be required either to shut down or be funded pursuant to a "continuing resolution" that authorizes agencies of the u.s. government to continue operations but does not authorize new spending initiatives, either of which could result in reduced or delayed orders or payments for products and services we
provide, which may decrease our revenue, profitability or cash flows or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations;
•   u.s. government spending could be impacted by sequestration or alternate arrangements, which increases the uncertainty as to, and the difficulty in predicting, u.s. government spending priorities and levels; and
•   we may experience declines in revenue, profitability and cash flows as a result of reduced or delayed orders or payments or other factors caused by economic difficulties of our customers and prospective customers, including u.s. federal, state and local governments.
the level of returns on defined benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods.
a substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, "defined benefit plans"), as a result of our acquisition of exelis. we may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to defined benefit plans as a result of macro-economic factors, such as interest rates, that are beyond our control. the cost of our defined benefit plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves various factors and uncertainties during those periods that can be volatile and unpredictable, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses, mortality of plan participants and trends for future medical costs. we develop our assumptions using relevant plan experience and expectations in conjunction with market-related data. our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators, financial market volatility, future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions.
we will make contributions to fund our defined benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so. the macro-economic factors discussed above, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by government funding or taxing authorities, or established by other agreement, may influence future funding requirements. a significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets, or other adverse changes to our overall defined benefit plans, could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods.
u.s. government cost accounting standards ("cas") govern the extent to which postretirement costs and plan contributions are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the u.s. government. as a result, we expect to continue to seek reimbursement from the u.s. government for a portion of our postretirement costs and plan contributions.
on december 27, 2011 the u.s. government's cost accounting standards board published a final rule that harmonizes cas pension cost reimbursement rules with the pension protection act of 2006 ("ppa") funding requirements. the rule is expected to eventually mitigate the mismatch between cas costs and ppa-amended employee retirement income security act of 1974 ("erisa") minimum funding requirements, and result in an acceleration of allowable cas pension costs as compared to the prior rules. the final rule applied to exelis' contracts starting in 2013, including a five-year phase in. the full phase-in was achieved in 2017. we anticipate that government contractors will be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any additional cas contract costs resulting from the final rule, although we can give no assurances in this regard.
we have a number of fixed-price contracts, which allow us to benefit from cost savings, but subject us to the risk of potential cost overruns, particularly for firm fixed-price contracts because we assume all of the cost burden. if our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. u.s. government contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the u.s. government can hold us responsible for completing a project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with our suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. the u.s. and other countries also may experience a significant increase in inflation. a significant increase in inflation rates could have a significant adverse impact on the profitability of these contracts. furthermore, if we do not meet contract deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. in addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. our results of operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts. cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our financial results. the potential impact of such risk on our financial results would increase if the mix of our contracts and programs shifted toward a greater percentage of fixed-price contracts, particularly firm fixed-price contracts.
we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.
accounting for our contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, including risks associated with customer directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries, unfavorable resolutions of claims and contractual matters, judgments
associated with estimating contract revenue and costs, and assumptions for schedule and technical issues. due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. for example, we must make assumptions regarding: (i) the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials; (ii) whether the intent of entering into multiple contracts was effectively to enter into a single project in order to determine whether such contracts should be combined or segmented; (iii) incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts in estimating revenue and profit rates, and record them when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance; and (iv) estimates of award fees in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for our contracts, materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
we are dependent on sales to customers outside the u.s. the percentage of our total revenue represented by revenue from products and services exported from the u.s., including foreign military sales, or manufactured or rendered abroad in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 22 percent, 20 percent and 29 percent, respectively. approximately 20 percent of our international business in fiscal 2017 was transacted in local currency. losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. we expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. also, a significant portion of our international revenue is from, and a significant portion of our business activity is being conducted with or in, less-developed countries and sometimes countries with unstable governments, or in areas of military conflict or at military installations. we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:
•   currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and currency revaluations;
•   the laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments relating to investments and operations, as well as u.s. laws affecting the activities of u.s. companies abroad, including the foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa");
•   import and export licensing requirements and regulations, as well as unforeseen changes in export controls and other trade regulations;
•   changes in regulatory requirements, including business or operating license requirements, imposition of tariffs or embargoes;
•   uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees;
•   risk of non-payment or delayed payment by foreign governments;
•   contractual obligations to non-u.s. customers may include specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or financial or other support arrangements or obligations, known as offset obligations, that may extend over several years, may require teaming with local companies and may result in significant penalties if not satisfied;
•   the complexity and necessity of using, and disruptions involving our, international dealers, distributors, sales representatives and consultants;
•   the difficulties of managing a geographically dispersed organization and culturally diverse workforces, including compliance with local laws and practices;
•   difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws;
•   uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for onerous contract terms;
•   rapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or u.s. anti-boycott legislation; and
•   increased risk of an incident resulting in damage or destruction to our facilities or products or resulting in injury or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors or other third parties.
our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of our employees, agents or business partners.
we have implemented compliance controls, policies and procedures designed to prevent reckless or criminal acts from being committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing payments to government officials, such as the fcpa, and to detect any such reckless or criminal acts committed. we cannot ensure, however, that our controls, policies and procedures will prevent or detect all such reckless or criminal acts, and we have been adversely impacted by such acts in the past. if not prevented, such reckless or criminal acts could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and suspension and debarment by the u.s. government and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business, our results of
operations and our reputation. in addition, misconduct involving data security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use of our customer's sensitive or classified information could result in remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation and could adversely impact our ability to continue to contract with the u.s. government.
we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and congress may prevent proposed sales to certain foreign governments.
we must first obtain export and other licenses and authorizations from various u.s. government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain products and technologies outside of the u.s. for example, the u.s. department of state must notify congress at least 15 to 60 days, depending on the size and location of the proposed sale, prior to authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to foreign governments. during that time, congress may take action to block the proposed sale. we can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that congress will not prevent or delay certain sales. any significant impairment of our ability to sell products or technologies outside of the u.s. could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, systems, services and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our current and future markets.
our businesses are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. accordingly, our performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:
•   identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets;
•   develop and maintain competitive products, systems, services and technologies;
•   enhance our offerings by adding innovative hardware, software or other features that differentiate our products, systems, services and technologies from those of our competitors; and
•   develop, manufacture and bring to market cost-effective offerings quickly.
we believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to develop new products, systems, services and technologies, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. the need to make these expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to the timely development of new products, systems, services or technologies. due to the design complexity of some of our products, systems, services and technologies, we may experience delays in completing development and introducing new products, systems, services or technologies in the future. any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. in addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. the failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business. furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations. the future direction of the domestic and global economies, including its impact on customer demand, also will have a significant impact on our overall performance.
we participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.
we participate in u.s. and international markets that are subject to uncertain economic conditions. in particular, u.s. government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration and potential alternative funding arrangements. in addition, certain of our non-u.s. customers, including in the middle east and other oil or natural-gas producing countries, could be adversely affected by weakness or volatility in oil or natural gas prices, or negative expectations about future prices or volatility, which could adversely affect demand for tactical communications or other products. as a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth in the markets in which we participate. because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent on estimates of growth in the markets we serve, the uncertainty renders estimates of or guidance relating to future revenue, income and expenditures even more difficult. as a result, we may make significant investments and expenditures but never realize the anticipated benefits.
we cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our profitability.
ongoing instability and current conflicts in global markets, including in the middle east and asia, and the potential for other conflicts and future terrorist activities and other recent geo-political events throughout the world, including the pending voluntary exit of the united kingdom from the european union (commonly referred to as "brexit"), have created economic and political uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and profitability. these matters cause uncertainty in the world's financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase the political, economic and
social instability in the geographic areas in which we operate. these matters may cause us to incur increased costs or experience difficulty with future borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit facilities or in the debt markets, or otherwise with financing our operating, investing (including any future acquisitions) or financing activities. these matters also may cause our insurance coverages and performance bonds to increase in cost, or in some cases, to be unavailable altogether.
we have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions and divestitures that involve significant risks and uncertainties.
strategic acquisitions and divestitures that we have made in the past, and may continue to make, present significant risks and uncertainties, which include:
•   difficulty in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions, including the risk that our due diligence does not identify or fully assess valuation issues, potential liabilities or other acquisition risks;
•   difficulty and expense in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings, and in entering into new markets in which we are not experienced, in an efficient and cost-effective manner while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures, and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration;
•   difficulty and expense in consolidating and rationalizing it infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code;
•   challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions;
•   risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the strategic acquisitions and divestitures do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;
•   risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties;
•   risk that indemnification related to divested businesses that we may be required to provide to acquirers of such businesses or that applicable purchase price adjustments related to such divestitures may be significant and could negatively impact our business;
•   risk that we are not able to complete strategic divestitures on satisfactory terms and conditions, including non-competition arrangements applicable to certain of our business lines, or within expected timeframes;
•   potential loss of key employees or customers of the businesses acquired or to be divested; and
•   risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations.
disputes with our subcontractors and the inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers to timely deliver our components, parts or services, could cause our products or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.
we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts. we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract or subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of the personnel of a subcontractor or vice versa or the subcontractor's failure to comply with applicable law. in addition, there are certain parts, components and services for many of our products and services that we source from other manufacturers or vendors. some of our suppliers, from time to time, experience financial and operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to supply the materials, components, subsystems and services that we require. our supply chain could also be disrupted by external events, such as natural disasters or other significant disruptions (including extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, cyber attacks and labor disputes), governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes, including product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, product authenticity and climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards. any inability to develop alternative sources of supply on a cost-effective and timely basis could materially impair our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services to our customers. we can give no assurances that we will be free from disputes with our subcontractors, material supply problems or component, subsystems or services problems in the future. also, our subcontractors and other suppliers may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials, components, subsystems and services they supply, which might result in greater product returns, service problems and warranty claims and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, in connection with our government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the u.s. government and we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other requirements regarding procurement of counterfeit, unauthorized or otherwise non-compliant parts or materials, including parts or materials they supply to us, and in some circumstances, we rely on their certifications as to their compliance. from time to time, there are components for which there may be only one supplier. the inability of a sole source supplier to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
many of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which often has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing or to have infringed directly or indirectly upon those intellectual property rights. claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. moreover, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products, services and solutions. our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. we rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. if we fail to successfully protect and enforce these rights, our competitive position could suffer. our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademark registrations. in addition, our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. we may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so. in addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
the outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved from time to time is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
from time to time, we are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of arbitrations. these actions may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. no assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. an adverse resolution of lawsuits or arbitrations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.
we are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. a significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense, technology and communications systems and products. new technologies associated with these systems and products may be untested or unproven. components of certain of the defense systems and products we develop are inherently dangerous. failures of satellites, missile systems, air traffic control systems, electronic warfare systems, space superiority systems, c4isr systems, homeland security applications and aircraft have the potential to cause loss of life and extensive property damage. other examples of unforeseen problems that could result, either directly or indirectly, in the loss of life or property or otherwise negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft, premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, problems with quality and workmanship, country of origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance. in addition, problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements. in many circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the u.s. government. we generally do not receive indemnification from foreign governments. although we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident or incident. it also is not possible for us to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. substantial claims resulting from an incident in excess of u.s. government indemnity and our insurance coverage would harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. other factors that may affect revenue and profits include loss of follow-on work, and, in the case of certain contracts, liquidated damages, penalties and repayment to the customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received. moreover, any accident or incident for which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect our standing with our customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.
changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including:
•   the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;
•   increases in expenses not fully deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process r&amp;d and impairment of goodwill or other long-term assets in connection with acquisitions;
•   changes in available tax credits;
•   changes in share-based compensation expense;
•   changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;
•   changes in domestic or international tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; and
•   the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities.
any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.
our level of indebtedness and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our unfunded defined benefit plans liability may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or our ability to incur additional debt.
at the end of fiscal 2017, we had $3.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt and approximately $1.3 billion of unfunded defined benefit plans liability. in the future we may increase our borrowings; however, our ability to do so will be subject to limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements. our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness as well as any future debt that we may incur and our ability to make contributions to our unfunded defined benefit plans liability, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due or make contributions to our unfunded defined benefit plans liability, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes; reducing our cash dividend rate and/or share repurchases; or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. in addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the defense technology industry could be impaired. the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt.
a downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business.
the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, mergers, acquisitions or dispositions. these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that any rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future. moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our debt securities. actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, would likely increase our borrowing costs and affect our ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt securities.
unforeseen environmental issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our operations are subject to and affected by many federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. in addition, we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, new restrictions on materials used in our operations. compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may require significant operating and capital costs. environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. we also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations related to remediation of conditions in the environment. in addition, if violations of environmental laws result in our, or in one or more of our operations, being identified as an excluded party in the u.s. government's system for award management, then we or one or more of our operations would become ineligible to receive certain contracts, subcontracts and other benefits from the federal government or to perform work under a government contract or subcontract. generally, such ineligibility would continue until the basis for the listing has been appropriately addressed. developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments under previously priced contracts, or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our corporate headquarters and significant business operations are located in florida, which is subject to the risk of major hurricanes. our worldwide operations and operations of our suppliers could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions. in the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers
or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
changes in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill or other long-term assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would adversely affect our results of operations.
as part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time, acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. these investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. these procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. after acquisition, such assumptions and judgment may prove to have been inaccurate and unforeseen issues could arise, which could adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. goodwill accounted for approximately 53 percent of our recorded total assets as of june 30, 2017. we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill annually, as well as when we change reporting units and when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. the impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. for additional information on accounting policies we have in place for impairment of goodwill, see our discussion under "critical accounting policies and estimates" in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of this report and note 1: significant accounting policies and note 8: goodwill in the notes.
some of our workforce is represented by labor unions, so our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.
approximately 600 of our u.s. employees are unionized, which represented approximately 4 percent of our employee-base at the end of fiscal 2017. as a result, we may experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business. we cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor collective bargaining agreements without impacting our financial condition. in addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. work stoppages could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our business has a continuing need to attract and retain significant numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel holding security clearances, to support our growth and to replace individuals whose employment has terminated due to retirement or other reasons. to the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case from time to time in recent years, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet.
risks relating to the spin-off of vectrus completed by exelis on september 27, 2014, before being acquired by harris, exelis completed the spin-off of vectrus, inc. ("vectrus"). after the spin-off, exelis and vectrus operated independently of each other and neither company had an ownership interest in the other. prior to the completion of the spin-off, exelis and vectrus entered into a distribution agreement and related separation agreements that provided mechanisms for an orderly separation and govern the post-separation relationship between exelis and vectrus. these agreements generally provide that each party is responsible for its respective assets, liabilities and obligations following the spin-off, including employee benefits, intellectual property, it, insurance and tax-related assets and liabilities. the agreements also set forth exelis' obligation to provide vectrus with certain temporary transition services. the agreements include the distribution agreement, employee matters agreement, tax matters agreement, transition services agreement and several intellectual property agreements. the following are among the risks we face in connection with the spin-off of vectrus completed by exelis:
we may be responsible for u.s. federal income tax liabilities that relate to the spin-off of vectrus completed by exelis.
in connection with the spin-off of vectrus, completed by exelis prior to our acquisition of exelis, exelis received an opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off will qualify for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code. however, if the factual assumptions or representations made in the opinion are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, we will not be able to rely on the opinion. furthermore, the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service ("irs") or the courts. accordingly, the irs or the courts may challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion and such challenge could prevail. if, notwithstanding receipt of the opinion, the spin-off is determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. in addition, if the spin-off transaction is taxable, each holder of exelis common stock who received
shares of vectrus in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received, thereby potentially increasing such holder's tax liability. even if the vectrus spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (but not to holders of exelis common stock who received shares of vectrus in the spin-off) in certain circumstances if subsequent significant acquisitions of exelis stock or the stock of vectrus were deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the vectrus spin-off. in this event, the resulting tax liability could be substantial.
in connection with the vectrus spin-off, vectrus indemnified exelis for certain liabilities and exelis indemnified vectrus for certain liabilities. this indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by vectrus and vectrus may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.
as part of the distribution agreement, exelis and vectrus indemnified each other with respect to such parties' assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or related separation agreements. there can be no assurance that the indemnity from vectrus will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities, or that vectrus will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that vectrus has agreed to assume. even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from vectrus any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. in addition, performance on indemnities that exelis provided vectrus may be significant and could negatively impact our business. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the vectrus spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.
the vectrus spin-off could be challenged under various u.s. state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that exelis did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spin-off, and that the spin-off left exelis insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that exelis intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including, without limitation, returning assets or vectrus shares to exelis or providing exelis with a claim for money damages against vectrus in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by exelis and the fair market value of vectrus at the time of the spin-off.
the measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws may vary depending on which jurisdiction's law is applied. generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), and such entity would be considered to have unreasonably small capital if it lacked adequate capital to conduct its business in the ordinary course and pay its liabilities as they become due. no assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that exelis was solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spin-off, including the distribution of vectrus common stock.
the distribution by exelis of the vectrus common stock in the spin-off also could be challenged under state corporate distribution statutes. under the indiana business corporation law, a corporation may not make distributions to its shareholders if, after giving effect to the distribution, (i) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) the corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities. no assurance can be given that a court will not later determine that the distribution by exelis of vectrus common stock in the spin-off was unlawful. each of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
risks relating to the spin-off of exelis from itt corporation in 2011, itt corporation ("itt") completed a transaction resulting in the spin-off of exelis and xylem, inc. ("xylem"). after the spin-off, exelis, itt and xylem operated independently of each other and none of the companies had any ownership interest in the other. in order to govern certain ongoing relationships between exelis, itt and xylem following the spin-off and to provide mechanisms for an orderly transition, exelis, itt and xylem executed various agreements that govern the ongoing relationships between and among the three companies after the spin-off and provide for the allocation of employee benefits, income taxes, and certain other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the spin-off. the executed agreements include the distribution agreement, benefits and compensation matters agreement, tax matters agreement, several real estate matters agreements and master transition services agreement.
the distribution agreement provides for certain indemnifications and cross-indemnifications among exelis, itt and xylem. the indemnifications address a variety of subjects, including indemnification by itt of exelis in respect of certain asserted and unasserted asbestos or silica liability claims. these indemnifications include claims relating to the presence or alleged presence of asbestos or silica in products manufactured, repaired or sold prior to the distribution date, subject to limited exceptions with respect to certain employee claims. these indemnifications also include claims relating to the presence or
alleged presence of asbestos or silica in the structure or material of any building or facility, subject to exceptions with respect to employee claims relating to exelis or xylem buildings or facilities. the indemnifications are absolute and indefinite. the indemnification associated with pending and future asbestos and silica claims does not expire. there can be no assurance, however, that itt will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations.
the tax matters agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of exelis, itt and xylem after the spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding u.s. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. exelis has joint and several liability with itt and xylem to the irs for the consolidated u.s. federal income taxes of the itt consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which exelis was part of that group. however, the tax matters agreement specifies the portion, if any, of this liability for which exelis bears responsibility, and itt and xylem agree to indemnify exelis against any amounts for which exelis is not responsible. though valid as between the parties, the tax matters agreement is not binding on the irs.
the following are among the risks we face in connection with exelis' spin-off from itt:
the itt spin-off of exelis may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.
exelis' spin-off from itt could be challenged under various u.s. state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that the itt spin-off left exelis, itt and/or xylem insolvent or with unreasonably small capital, or that exelis, itt and/or xylem intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature and that itt did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the itt spin-off. if a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the itt spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if we are required to indemnify itt or xylem in connection with the itt spin-off of exelis, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted.
pursuant to the distribution agreement entered into in connection with the itt spin-off and certain other agreements among exelis, itt and xylem, itt and xylem agreed to indemnify exelis from certain liabilities, and exelis agreed to indemnify itt and xylem for certain liabilities as discussed further above. indemnities that we may be required to provide itt and xylem may be significant and could negatively impact our business. further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from itt and xylem will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that itt or xylem will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is intended to assist in an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. this md&a is provided as a supplement to, should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report. except for the historical information contained herein, the discussions in this md&a contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our future results could differ materially from those discussed herein. factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below in this md&a under "forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results."
the following is a list of the sections of this md&a, together with our perspective on their contents, which we hope will assist in reading these pages:
•   business considerations - a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; fiscal 2017 results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators; and industry-wide opportunities, challenges and risks that are relevant to us in defense, government and commercial markets.
•   operations review - an analysis of our consolidated results of operations and of the results in each of our business segments, to the extent the segment operating results are helpful to an understanding of our business as a whole, for the three years presented in our financial statements.
•   liquidity, capital resources and financial strategies - an analysis of cash flows, funding of pension plans, common stock repurchases, dividends, capital structure and resources, contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements, commercial commitments, financial risk management, impact of foreign exchange and impact of inflation.
•   critical accounting policies and estimates - a discussion of accounting policies and estimates that require the most judgment and a discussion of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented by us and their potential impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
•   forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results - cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or our current expectations or projections.
business considerations general we generate revenue, income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing or providing, and selling advanced, technology-based solutions that solve government and commercial customers' mission-critical challenges. we support government and commercial customers in more than 100 countries, with our largest customers being various departments and agencies of the u.s. government and their prime contractors. our products, systems and services have defense and civil government applications, as well as commercial applications. as of the end of fiscal 2017, we had approximately 17,000 employees, including approximately 7,700 engineers and scientists. we generally sell directly to our customers, and we utilize agents and intermediaries to sell and market some products and services, especially in international markets.
we structure our operations primarily around the products, systems and services we sell and the markets we serve, and we report the financial results of our continuing operations in the following three reportable segments, which are also referred to as our business segments:
•   communication systems, serving markets in tactical communications and defense products, including tactical ground and airborne radio communications solutions and night vision technology, and in public safety networks;
•   electronic systems, providing electronic warfare, avionics and c4isr solutions for the defense industry and atm solutions for the civil aviation industry; and
•   space and intelligence systems, providing intelligence, space protection, geospatial, complete earth observation, universe exploration, pnt, and environmental solutions for national security, defense, civil and commercial customers, using advanced sensors, antennas and payloads, as well as ground processing and information analytics.
as described above and in more detail in note 1: significant accounting policies under "principles of consolidation" and in note 3: discontinued operations and divestitures in the notes, we completed the divestiture of caprock in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and the divestiture of it services in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. caprock
and it services were part of our former critical networks segment and are reported as discontinued operations in this report. our historical financial results have been restated for all periods presented in this report to account for businesses reported as discontinued operations in this report. except for disclosures related to our cash flows, or unless otherwise specified, disclosures in this report relate solely to our continuing operations.
in connection with entering into the definitive agreement to sell it services, our other remaining operations that had been part of our former critical networks segment, including our atm business and our pmrf program, were integrated with our electronic systems segment effective for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, and our critical networks segment was eliminated. the historical results, discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this report reflect the impact of these changes for all periods presented in order to present all segment information on a comparable basis. there is no impact on our previously reported consolidated statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows resulting from these segment changes.
financial information with respect to all of our other activities, including corporate costs not allocated to our business segments or discontinued operations, is reported as part of the "engineering, selling and administrative expenses," "non-operating income (loss)," "interest income," "interest expense" or "discontinued operations, net of income taxes" line items in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
value drivers of our business fiscal 2017 represented a critical inflection point for us. we entered the year undergoing a multi-year transformation to reposition the company and deliver against our strategic priorities. through disciplined execution, we were able to capture annual run-rate savings from the exelis acquisition a full year ahead of schedule, while driving operational efficiencies and optimizing our portfolio to focus on businesses where technology is a differentiator. we completed the it services and caprock divestitures during the fiscal year and used the proceeds along with our net cash provided by operating activities to repurchase shares of our common stock, pay down debt and make a voluntary contribution to our pension plans. in fiscal 2018, we intend to focus on continuing to create long-term, sustainable shareholder value by building on the positive momentum from our solid fiscal 2017 performance that included delivering against all of our strategic priorities. we expect the combination of our strong competitive position, differentiated technologies that address our customers' most critical challenges and excellent operational execution to drive top-line growth and higher earnings in the medium-term.
our strategic focus includes:
•   growing revenue across all three business segments;
•   driving flawless execution while maintaining margins through operational excellence; and
•   maximizing cash flow with balanced capital deployment while continuing to invest for the future.
as we have seen in the government fiscal year ("gfy") 2017 omnibus appropriations bill, as well as the president's 2018 budget request and congressional markups, the u.s. government funding outlook is improving, and our programs are expected to be largely well-supported, especially within the dod for our tactical communications business, electronic systems and in intelligence community budgets. an important part of our strategy is to grow revenue across the business in fiscal 2018 and beyond, and we expect all segments will contribute to this growth. for communication systems, we expect to begin seeing the benefits of dod modernizations towards the second half of fiscal 2018 as we start to deliver next-generation tactical radios with new features and capabilities to the u.s. special operations forces and the u.s. army, and we believe this will continue into fiscal 2019 and beyond. our international tactical business began to stabilize in the second half of fiscal 2017, and we expect to return to growth in the medium-term as the middle east comes out of a trough and australia and u.k. modernizations get underway. in electronic systems, we expect to see growth across the board. our electronic warfare business has a solid and growing pipeline of opportunities on the f-35, f-16 and f-18 platforms, as well as for the b-52 and c-130j platforms. for space and intelligence systems, we expect to see continued strong growth in the classified area, driven by budget increases and expansion into new adjacencies. we also expect increasing momentum in commercial space from recapitalizations.
our operational excellence program, harris business excellence ("hbx"), is focused on streamlining processes, optimizing program execution, and increasing customer satisfaction. hbx incorporates standardized, industry-proven processes and tools based on the principles of lean six sigma. since implementation, we have made significant strides in customer satisfaction, productivity and asset velocity through our efforts to optimize processes, eliminate waste, reduce costs and enhance quality across multiple aspects of our business. one method we use to drive continuous improvement is "value engineering" - continuously evaluating new materials, processes and technologies to insert into products already in production, helping to reduce costs and improve both quality and customer satisfaction.
innovation is at the core of our success, and r&d investment represents the foundation for innovation. our r&d investments are focused on leveraging our existing technology portfolio to introduce new solutions or expand customer-centric features and functions on existing solutions. innovation also leads to natural extensions of our core capabilities for
capturing new opportunities in adjacent markets. innovation provides differentiation and is a key competitive advantage for our business.
we have adopted a portfolio management approach designed to optimize investment in r&d at the company level rather than the business unit level. this approach is intended to ensure our r&d investment is cost-effective, supports innovation across the entire company and maximizes efficiency while maintaining our technological edge. we introduced standardized processes and common metrics to track progress and gauge success, and established core technology centers to more fully leverage r&d investment across our company.
during fiscal 2017, we thoughtfully deployed proceeds from divestitures and net cash provided by operating activities. we returned $710 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and another $262 million in dividends. we also used $499 million for net repayment of borrowings (including retiring $575 million of debt) and $400 million for a voluntary contribution to our u.s. defined benefit plans which helped reduce our unfunded defined benefit plans liability by 44 percent to $1.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. in fiscal 2018, we expect to improve our operating cash flow and to use our capital to achieve our debt repayment commitment, as well as for share repurchases and dividends.
key indicators we believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our financial results, including: revenue; income from continuing operations and income from continuing operations per diluted common share; income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue; net cash provided by operating activities; return on invested capital; return on average equity; and consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio. the measure of our success is reflected in our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators as discussed below.
fiscal 2017 results of operations key indicators:    revenue, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per diluted common share and income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue represent key measurements of our value drivers:
refer to md&a heading "operations review" below in this report for more information.
liquidity and capital resources key indicators:     net cash provided by operating activities, return on invested capital, return on average equity and our consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio also represent key measurements of our value drivers:
•   net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $569 million in fiscal 2017 from $924 million in fiscal 2016 primarily due to a $400 million voluntary contribution to our defined benefit plans in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017;
•   return on invested capital (defined as after-tax operating income from continuing operations divided by the two-point average of invested capital at the beginning and end of the fiscal year, where invested capital equals equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents) increased to 11 percent in fiscal 2017 from 10 percent in fiscal 2016;
•   return on average equity (defined as income from continuing operations divided by the two-point average of equity at the beginning and end of the fiscal year) increased to 21 percent in fiscal 2017 from 19 percent in fiscal 2016;
•   our consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio at june 30, 2017 was 58 percent, compared to our 65 percent covenant limitation under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility;
•   our cash used for net repayment of borrowings decreased to $499 million (including retiring $575 million of debt) in fiscal 2017 from $669 million in fiscal 2016; and
•   our unfunded defined benefit plans liability decreased $1.0 billion in fiscal 2017 to $1.3 billion at june 30, 2017 compared to $2.3 billion at july 1, 2016.
refer to md&a heading "liquidity, capital resources and financial strategies" below in this report for more information on net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities.
industry-wide opportunities, challenges and risks department of defense and other u.s. federal markets:    our largest customers are various departments and agencies of the u.s. government - the percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 74 percent, 77 percent and 66 percent, respectively. the gfy 2017 (u.s. government fiscal years begin october 1 and end september 30) budget cycle ended with the omnibus appropriations bill being passed by congress and signed by president trump on may 5, 2017. our programs were fully funded and continue to remain priorities for u.s. government customers. in addition, president trump's gfy 2018 budget request fully funded all of our major programs in both the dod and civil agencies. specifically, the gfy 2018 budget request included $574 billion in dod base funding with an additional $65 billion in overseas contingency operations ("oco") funding. the dod budget request increases funding across all of the services, including socom, from the 2017 gfy continuing resolution ("cr") levels and provides a 19.2 percent increase in r&d funding and a 4.6 percent increase in procurement funding from 2017 gfy cr levels. the budget request funds the dod with $52 billion over the limits mandated in the budget control act of 2011 ("bca"), which established limits on discretionary spending and reduced planned defense spending by $487 billion over a ten-year period beginning with gfy 2012. in addition, the bca provided for additional automatic spending reductions, known as sequestration, that went into effect march 1, 2013, that would have resulted in an additional $500 billion reduction to planned defense spending over a nine-year period beginning with gfy 2013.
in november 2015, president obama signed into law the bipartisan budget act of 2015 ("bba 2015"), which raised the limit on the u.s. government's debt through march 2017 and increased the sequester caps on discretionary spending imposed by the bca by $80 billion over gfy 2016 - 2017, providing more certainty in the near-term budget planning process. however, budget caps for gfys 2018 through 2022 remain intact after the enactment of bba 2015 as does the across-the-board spending reduction methodology provided under the bca.
we anticipate debate and negotiations will continue within the u.s. government over defense spending for gfy 2018 and beyond, which may have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and on our specific programs. however, as described in further detail in the "value drivers of our business" section of this md&a, our programs have been well supported in both the gfy 2017 omnibus appropriations bill as well as the president's gfy 2018 budget request.
government oversight and risk:    as a u.s. government contractor, we are subject to u.s. government oversight. the u.s. government may investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. depending on the results of those investigations and audits, the u.s. government could make claims against us. under u.s. government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able to bid on, or from being awarded, new u.s. government contracts for a period of time determined by the u.s. government. similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.
for a discussion of risks relating to u.s. government contracts and subcontracts, see "item 1. business - principal customers; government contracts" and "item 1a. risk factors" of this report. we are also subject to other risks associated with u.s. government business, including technological uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and other risks, which are discussed in "item 1a. risk factors" and "item 3. legal proceedings" of this report.
state and local:    we also provide products to state and local government agencies that are committed to protecting our homeland and public safety. the public safety market was highly competitive and dependent on state and local government budgets during fiscal 2017. future market opportunities include upgrading aging analog infrastructure to new digital standards, as well as opportunities associated with next-generation lte solutions for high data-rate applications, an emerging market in the early stages of development.
international:   we believe there is continuing international demand from military and government customers for tactical radios, public safety communications, electronic warfare equipment, air traffic management, electronic attack and release systems and isr. we believe we can leverage our domain expertise and proven technology provided in the u.s. to further expand our international business.

* not meaningful revenue fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    the decrease in revenue in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower tactical communications revenue in our communication systems segment and lower revenue due to the impact of the divestiture of our aerostructures business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which contributed $60 million of revenue in fiscal 2016 in our electronic systems segment, and the impact of certain environmental and commercial space programs in our space and intelligence systems segment transitioning from a build-out to a sustainment phase, partially offset by higher revenue from the ramp up of the united arab emirates integrated battle management system (bms-elts) program and from electronic warfare in our electronic systems segment and by $36 million of higher revenue from classified customers in our space and intelligence systems segment.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in revenue in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion in our operating results of revenue from a full year of exelis operations as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. revenue in fiscal 2016 also reflected weakness in our communication systems segment related to dod and international tactical radio markets.
see the "discussion of business segment results of operations" discussion below in this md&a for further information.
gross margin percentage fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    gross margin as a percentage of revenue ("gross margin percentage") in fiscal 2017 was comparable with fiscal 2016 reflecting cost containment and integration-related synergy savings and higher pension income, mostly offset by lower margins from the ads-b program as it transitions from a build-out to a sustainment phase and the margin impact of lower revenue in our communication systems segment.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a shift in the mix of contract types, toward an increased percentage of lower-margin cost-plus contracts. additionally, gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 reflected a lower gross margin percentage in exelis legacy tactical radio and night vision product lines and write-downs, recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, of certain assets related to restructuring programs.
see the "discussion of business segment results of operations" discussion below in this md&a for further information.
engineering, selling and administrative expenses fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    the decrease in engineering, selling and administrative ("esa") expenses in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to cost containment, integration-related synergy savings and a $63 million reduction in integration and other costs associated with our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by the benefit in fiscal 2016 of $101 million net liability reduction for certain post-employment benefit plans recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. esa expenses as a percentage of revenue ("esa percentage") in fiscal 2017 was comparable with fiscal 2016.
overall company-sponsored r&d costs were $310 million in fiscal 2017 compared with $305 million in fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in esa expenses in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion in our operating results of esa expenses from a full year of exelis operations as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, $109 million of amortization of intangible assets acquired, $121 million of integration and other costs associated with the acquisition (including $11 million for amortization of a step-up in inventory) and $33 million of charges, recorded in fiscal 2016, for restructuring and other items. these drivers of the increase in esa expenses were partially offset by a net liability reduction of $101 million, recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, for certain post-employment benefit plans. the decrease in esa percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the net liability reduction for certain post-employment benefits described in the preceding sentence, lower esa percentage from exelis businesses and cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis, partially offset by the amortization, integration and other costs and charges for restructuring noted in this paragraph.
overall company-sponsored r&d costs were $305 million in fiscal 2016 compared with $276 million in fiscal 2015.
see the "discussion of business segment results of operations" discussion below in this md&a for further information.
fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    non-operating income in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an adjustment to the net gain on the sale of aerostructures. non-operating income in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a $10 million net gain on the divestiture of aerostructures during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    non-operating income in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the same reasons as noted above for fiscal 2016 non-operating income. non-operating loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $118 million of charges associated with our optional redemption on may 27, 2015 of the entire outstanding $400 million principal amount of our 5.95% notes due december 1, 2017 and the entire outstanding $350 million principal amount of our 6.375% notes due june 15, 2019, including a total of $5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts related to these notes that were written off in connection with our redemption of the notes. these charges were partially offset by a pre-tax gain of $9 million related to our divestiture of hcs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
see note 21: non-operating income (loss) in the notes for further information.
net interest expense fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    our net interest expense decreased in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower average debt levels as a result of $499 million of net repayment of borrowings, which included $313 million of repayment of our variable-rate term loans and our repayment of the entire outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% notes due october 1, 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    our net interest expense increased in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of our issuance of $2.4 billion of debt securities and our borrowing of $1.3 billion under a term loan agreement to finance our acquisition of exelis in fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
see note 18: interest expense in the notes for further information.
income taxes fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    in fiscal 2017, our effective tax rate (income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes) benefited from the net favorable impact of:
•   the adoption of the accounting standard issued by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") that changed the accounting for certain aspects of stock options and other share-based compensation and resulted in a $23 million income tax benefit, as discussed in note 2: accounting changes or recent accounting pronouncements in the notes;
•   several differences between gaap and tax accounting related to investments; and
•   additional deductions and additional research credits claimed on our fiscal 2016 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2016.
in fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate benefited from:
•   settlement of several items for amounts that were lower than previously recorded estimates;
•   legislation enacted in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 that restored the u.s. federal income tax credit for qualifying r&amp;d expenses for calendar year 2015 and made the credit permanent for the periods following december 31, 2015;
•   recognition of a tax loss, net of valuation allowances, upon the divestiture of aerostructures;
•   state tax reductions resulting from our integration of exelis operations; and
•   several differences between gaap and tax accounting related to investments.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015: the major discrete items from which our fiscal 2016 effective tax rate benefited are those noted for fiscal 2016 in the preceding discussion under "income taxes." in fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate benefited from foreign tax credits resulting from a dividend paid by a foreign subsidiary, finalizing issues with various foreign and domestic tax authorities for amounts lower than estimates previously recorded, additional deductions (primarily related to manufacturing) and additional research credits claimed on our fiscal 2014 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2014. these benefits were partially offset in the fourth quarter by the tax cost of repatriating offshore funds, the impact of non-deductible goodwill in our divestiture of hcs and the non-deductibility of some acquisition-related costs.
see note 23: income taxes in the notes for further information.
income from continuing operations fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016: the increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to the combined effects of the reasons noted above in this "consolidated results of operations" discussion regarding fiscal 2017 and 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015: the increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to the combined effects of the reasons noted above in this "consolidated results of operations" discussion regarding fiscal 2016 and 2015.
income from continuing operations per diluted common share fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    the increase in income from continuing operations per diluted common share in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was due to the increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 and fewer diluted weighted average common shares outstanding due to significant levels of repurchases of shares of common stock under our repurchase program during fiscal 2017.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in income from continuing operations per diluted common share in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was due to the increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, partially offset by greater diluted weighted average common shares outstanding as a result of the issuance of shares in connection with the acquisition of exelis.
see the "common stock repurchases" discussion and the "common stock" paragraph of the "capital structure and resources" discussion below in this md&a for further information.
discontinued operations, net of income taxes see note 3: discontinued operations and divestitures in the notes for information regarding it services and caprock, which are reported as discontinued operations in this report. as a result, our historical financial results have been restated to account for it services and caprock as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report.
discussion of business segment results of operations communication systems segment
fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    segment revenue in fiscal 2017 included tactical communications revenue of $1,341 million, a 6 percent decrease from $1,429 million in fiscal 2016; and public safety and professional communications revenue of $412 million, a 5 percent decrease from $435 million in fiscal 2016. the decrease in tactical communications revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $85 million lower revenue from legacy exelis tactical radios and night vision products. the decrease in public safety and professional communications revenue was primarily due to the wind-down of a significant international network project.
the decrease in segment gross margin in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue, partially offset by lower restructuring charges. segment gross margin percentage decreased 1 percentage point in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016, despite 6 percent lower revenue and a less favorable revenue mix, primarily due to cost containment and exelis acquisition integration-related synergy savings. the decreases in segment esa expenses and esa percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 were primarily due to cost containment, lower restructuring costs and exelis acquisition integration-related synergy savings. the slight increase in segment operating income and the increase in segment operating income as a percentage of revenue ("operating margin percentage") in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment. segment operating margin percentage increased 2 percentage points in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 despite the impact of 6 percent lower revenue over the same period.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 42 percent in fiscal 2017 and 52 percent in fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increase in segment revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the inclusion in segment operating results of exelis operations (principally ground and airborne tactical radio and night vision operations) as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
segment revenue in fiscal 2016 also reflected weakness related to dod and international tactical radio markets. the decrease in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a less favorable mix among products and programs, $14 million of restructuring and other charges and lower gross margin percentage in exelis legacy tactical radio and night vision product lines. segment esa percentage in fiscal 2016 was slightly higher compared with fiscal 2015 primarily due to $6 million of charges, recorded during fiscal 2016, for restructuring and other items, mostly offset by lower esa percentage from exelis businesses and cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis. the decreases in segment operating income and segment operating margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.
electronic systems segment
fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    the increase in segment revenue in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher revenue from the ramp up of the united arab emirates integrated battle management system (bms-elts) program and from electronic warfare solutions, partially offset by $60 million of lower revenue attributable to the divestiture of aerostructures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and $41 million of lower revenue from the impact of the ads-b program transitioning from a build-out to a sustainment phase.
the increases in segment gross margin and gross margin percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 were primarily due to continued strong program performance principally in the electronic warfare solutions business and higher pension income, partially offset by a $21 million unfavorable margin impact from the ads-b program as it transitions from a build-out to a sustainment phase. the decrease in segment esa expenses in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to exelis acquisition integration-related synergy savings and $8 million of charges for restructuring and other costs recorded in fiscal 2016, partially offset by $13 million of higher r&d expenses. segment esa percentage for fiscal 2017 was comparable with fiscal 2016. the increases in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment. segment operating margin percentage increased 2 percentage points in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 despite revenue increasing only 1 percent over the same period.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 82 percent in fiscal 2017 and 83 percent in fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increases in segment revenue, gross margin, esa expenses and operating income in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 were primarily due to the inclusion in segment operating results of exelis operations (principally integrated electronic warfare systems; radar, reconnaissance and undersea systems; electronic attack and release systems; specialty applications; composites operations; and atm solutions for the aviation industry) as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
segment revenue also reflected higher revenue from faa nextgen modernization programs, electronic warfare and counter-ied systems, partially offset by lower revenue from commercial broadband satellite program terminals. the increase in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was due to a more favorable mix of programs. the segment esa percentage in fiscal 2016 was slightly lower compared with fiscal 2015 as $8 million of charges for restructuring and other costs recorded in fiscal 2016 were partially offset by cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis. the increase in segment operating margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.
space and intelligence systems segment
fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016:    segment revenue in fiscal 2017 increased slightly compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to $36 million of higher revenue from classified customers, mostly offset by lower revenue from the impact of certain environmental and commercial space programs transitioning from a build-out to a sustainment phase.
the increases in segment gross margin and gross margin percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 were primarily attributable to improved program performance and higher pension income, partially offset by a $30 million impact due to lower revenue from relatively higher-margin environmental and commercial space programs. the increases in segment esa expenses and esa percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 were primarily due to higher r&d and proposal expenses. the increases in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment. segment operating margin percentage increased 1 percentage point in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 despite slight revenue growth over the same period.
the percentage of this segment's revenue that was derived from sales to u.s. government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the u.s. government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 95 percent in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015:    the increases in segment revenue, gross margin, esa expenses and operating income in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 were primarily due to the inclusion in segment operating results of exelis operations (principally geospatial intelligence solutions; integrated sensing and information systems; environmental intelligence; precision instruments and pnt; and command, control and communication systems operations) as a result of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
segment revenue also reflected higher revenue from new classified programs, including programs in space superiority and protection, partially offset by the completion of several other classified programs. the decrease in segment gross margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was due to a less favorable mix of cost-plus intelligence and space payload programs, as well as the retirement of risk on certain space programs in fiscal 2015. the decrease in segment esa percentage in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to lower esa percentage from exelis businesses. the increase in segment operating margin percentage in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflected the combined effects of the items discussed above regarding this segment for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015.
amortization of intangible assets from exelis inc. acquisition          109             109               -       %             9               *
* not meaningful fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016: the increase in unallocated corporate expense in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a net liability reduction of $101 million for certain post-employment benefit plans
in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, partially offset by a $63 million decrease in exelis acquisition-related and other charges. because the exelis acquisition benefited our entire company as opposed to any individual segment, we recorded the acquired intangible assets as corporate assets and the related amortization expense as unallocated corporate expense.
fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015: the decrease in unallocated corporate expense in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a net liability reduction of $101 million for certain post-employment benefit plans, a $14 million decrease in acquisition-related costs associated with the acquisition of exelis, including transaction, integration, restructuring and other costs, and cost savings realized after our acquisition of exelis.

effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents          (4   )           (24   )             (23   )
cash and cash equivalents:    the $3 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to $710 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $584 million used to repay borrowings (which included $313 million of repayment of our variable-rate term loans and our repayment at maturity of the entire outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% notes due october 1, 2016), $262 million used to pay cash dividends and $119 million used for net additions of property, plant and equipment, mostly offset by $1,014 million of net proceeds from sales of businesses, $569 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $85 million of proceeds from borrowings and $54 million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options. the $6 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $924 million of net cash provided by operating activities, $181 million of net proceeds from the sale of businesses, $61 million of proceeds from borrowings and $44 million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options, mostly offset by $730 million used to repay borrowings, $252 million used to pay cash dividends and $152 million used for net additions of property, plant and equipment.
we ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $484 million, and we have a senior unsecured $1 billion revolving credit facility that expires in july 2020 ($925 million of which was available to us as of june 30, 2017 as a result of $75 million of short-term debt outstanding under our commercial paper program). additionally, we had $3.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding at june 30, 2017, the majority of which we incurred in connection with our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. for further information regarding our long-term debt, see note 13: long-term debt in the notes. our $484 million of cash and cash equivalents at june 30, 2017 included $171 million held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $132 million is considered permanently reinvested. of the $132 million, $96 million was available for use in the u.s. without incurring additional u.s. income taxes. we would be required to recognize u.s. income taxes of $11 million on the remaining $36 million if we were to repatriate such funds to the u.s., but we have no current plans to repatriate such funds.
given our current cash position, outlook for funds generated from operations, credit ratings, available credit facility, cash needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date, and do not expect to experience, any material issues with liquidity, although we can give no assurances concerning our future liquidity, particularly in light of our current level of debt, u.s. government budget uncertainties and the state of global commerce and financial uncertainty.
we also currently believe that existing cash, funds generated from operations, our credit facility and access to the public and private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, repurchases under our share repurchase program and repayments of our term loans and debt securities at maturity for the next 12 months and for the reasonably foreseeable future thereafter. our total capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $130 million. we anticipate tax payments in fiscal 2018 to be approximately equal to or marginally less than our tax expense for the same period, subject to adjustment for certain timing differences. for additional information regarding our income taxes, see note 23: income taxes in the notes. other than those cash outlays noted in the "contractual obligations" discussion below in this md&a, capital
expenditures, dividend payments, payments under our term loans and repurchases of common stock, no other significant cash outlays are anticipated in fiscal 2018.
there can be no assurance, however, that our business will continue to generate cash flows at current levels or that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program or our credit facility or in the debt markets will not be impacted by any potential future credit and capital markets disruptions. if we are unable to maintain cash balances or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our obligations, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate strategic acquisitions, reduce or terminate our share repurchases, reduce or eliminate dividends, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. our ability to make principal payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense, government and other markets we serve and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control.
net cash provided by operating activities:    the $355 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $415 million more in qualified pension plan contributions, including a $400 million voluntary contribution, and $127 million less of impairment of goodwill and other assets, partially offset by $229 million more in net income. cash flow from operations was positive in all of our business segments in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities:    the $871 million increase in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $833 million more in net proceeds from sales of businesses (consisting of $646 million of net proceeds from the sale of it services and $370 million of net proceeds from the sale of caprock in fiscal 2017, compared with $181 million in net proceeds from the sale of aerostructures in fiscal 2016), as well as $33 million less used for net additions of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software. the $3.3 billion decrease in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $3.2 billion in net cash used to acquire exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities:    the $545 million increase in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 was primarily due to $710 million more cash used to repurchase our common stock and $10 million more cash used to pay dividends, partially offset by $170 million less cash used for net repayment of borrowings (reflecting $499 million of cash used for net repayment of borrowings in fiscal 2017 compared with $669 million of cash used to repay borrowings in fiscal 2016).
the $3.3 billion increase in net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $3.6 billion less proceeds from borrowings (primarily reflecting the debt issued in connection of our acquisition of exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015) and $54 million more net cash used to pay dividends, partially offset by: (i) $224 million less net cash used to repay borrowings (reflecting $730 million of net cash used to repay borrowings in fiscal 2016 compared with $954 million of net cash used to repay borrowings in fiscal 2015 including the redemption of two series of our notes), (ii) $150 million less net cash used to repurchase our common stock, and (iii) $39 million less net cash used in other financing activities.
funding of pension plans funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations are a major consideration in making contributions to our u.s. pension plans. although we have significant discretion in making voluntary contributions, the employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 and further amended by the worker, retiree, and employer recovery act of 2008, the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act ("map-21") and applicable internal revenue code regulations mandate minimum funding thresholds. failure to satisfy the minimum funding thresholds could result in restrictions on our ability to amend the plan or make benefit payments. with respect to our u.s. qualified pension plans, we intend to contribute annually not less than the required minimum funding thresholds.
the highway and transportation funding act of 2014 ("hatfa") and bba 2015 further extended the interest rate stabilization provision of map-21 until 2020. we made a $400 million voluntary contribution to our u.s. qualified pension plans during fiscal 2017. as a result, we currently do not anticipate making any contributions to our u.s. qualified pension plans during fiscal 2018.
future required contributions will depend primarily on the actual annual return on assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation at the end of each year. depending on these factors, and the resulting funded status of our pension plans, the level of future statutory minimum contributions could be material. we have net unfunded defined benefit plan obligations of approximately $1.3 billion as of june 30, 2017 compared with approximately $2.3 billion as of july 1, 2016. see note 14: pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes for further information regarding our defined benefit plans.
common stock repurchases during fiscal 2017, we used $710 million to repurchase shares of our common stock under our 2013 repurchase program and our 2017 repurchase program, including (i) $600 million pursuant to asr agreements, as described below; (ii) approximately $100 million to repurchase 1,100,203 shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price per share of $90.45, including commissions; and (iii) approximately $11 million to repurchase 101,030 shares of our common stock from our rabbi trust, which is associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, at an average price per share of $110.34. during fiscal 2016, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our repurchase program. in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, $21 million and $16 million, respectively, in shares of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. shares repurchased by us are cancelled and retired.
on february 6, 2017, we entered into the february asr - a fixed-dollar asr transaction to repurchase an unspecified total number of shares of our common stock for $350 million - and on may 5, 2017, we entered into the may asr - a fixed-dollar asr transaction to repurchase an unspecified total number of shares of our common stock for $250 million. pursuant to each of these asr transactions, the counterparty delivers to us shares of our common stock during the term of the transaction in exchange for an up-front fixed dollar payment. the specific total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the transaction based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock during the term of the transaction, less a discount. shares delivered pursuant to asr transactions are retired in the period of delivery, and the up-front payment is accounted for as a reduction to the "other capital" and "retained earnings" line items in our consolidated balance sheet in the period the payment is made.
the following table summarizes our asr transactions in fiscal 2017:
(1) pursuant to the may asr, on may 5, 2017, we paid $250 million and received an initial delivery of 1,931,818 shares of our common stock based on a price of $110.00 per share, representing approximately 85 percent of the total number of shares of our common stock we expect to repurchase under the may asr. the specific total number of shares we ultimately repurchase under the may asr will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock during the term of the transaction, less a discount, and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the may asr. upon settlement of the may asr (expected no later than the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018), we may receive additional shares of our common stock from the counterparty or, under certain limited circumstances, be required to deliver shares of our common stock to the counterparty.
on january 26, 2017, our board of directors approved our 2017 repurchase program - a new $1 billion share repurchase program that does not have a stated expiration date and is in addition to our 2013 repurchase program - a $1 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors on august 23, 2013 that also did not have a stated expiration date. our repurchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 used the entire remaining authorization under our 2013 repurchase program (approximately $233 million) and a portion of the authorization under our 2017 repurchase program, and consequently, we will not make further repurchases under our 2013 repurchase program. as of june 30, 2017, we had a remaining, unused authorization of approximately $973 million under our 2017 repurchase program. repurchases under our repurchase program are expected to be funded with available cash and commercial paper and may be made through open market purchases, private transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions or any combination thereof. the level of our repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. the timing, volume and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. additional information regarding our repurchase programs is set forth above under "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this report.
dividends on august 25, 2017, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.53 per share to $.57 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of $2.28 per share, which was our sixteenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly cash dividend rate. our annualized cash dividend rate in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $2.12 per share, $2.00 per share and $1.88 per share, respectively. there can be no assurances that our annualized cash dividend rate will continue to increase. quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in march, june, september and december. we currently expect that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no assurances concerning payment of future dividends. the declaration of dividends and the amount thereof will
depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. additional information concerning our dividends is set forth above under "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" of this report.
capital structure and resources
2015 credit agreement:    as discussed in note 11: credit arrangements in the notes, on july 1, 2015, we established a new $1 billion 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "2015 credit facility") by entering into a revolving credit agreement (the "2015 credit agreement") with a syndicate of lenders. the 2015 credit facility replaced our prior $1 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. the description of the 2015 credit facility and the 2015 credit agreement set forth in note 11: credit arrangements in the notes is incorporated herein by reference.
short-term debt:     our short-term debt at june 30, 2017 and july 1, 2016 was $80 million and $15 million, respectively. our short-term debt at july 1, 2016 consisted of local borrowings by international subsidiaries for working capital needs. during fiscal 2017, our short-term debt increased to a fiscal quarter-end high of $233 million as of march 31, 2017, primarily due to commercial paper issued to partially fund repayment of the entire outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% notes due october 1, 2016. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we used net proceeds from the caprock and it services divestitures to repay commercial paper, and as of june 30, 2017, our short-term debt consisted of $75 million under our commercial paper program and $5 million of local borrowings of international subsidiaries. our commercial paper program was supported at june 30, 2017 and july 1, 2016 by the 2015 credit facility.
long-term variable-rate debt:    the description of the term loan agreement set forth in note 13: long-term debt in the notes is incorporated herein by reference. as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, on may 29, 2015, in order to fund a portion of the cash consideration and other amounts payable in connection with our acquisition of exelis, we borrowed $1.3 billion under our term loan agreement, comprised of two tranches:
long-term fixed-rate debt:    the description of our long-term fixed-rate debt set forth in note 13: long-term debt in the notes is incorporated herein by reference. as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, on may 27, 2015, we completed our optional redemption of the entire outstanding $400 million principal amount of our 5.95% notes due december 1, 2017 at a "make-whole" redemption price of $448 million and the entire outstanding $350 million principal amount of our 6.375% notes due june 15, 2019 at a "make-whole" redemption price of $415 million. the notes were terminated and cancelled.
as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, on april 27, 2015, in order to fund a portion of the cash consideration and other amounts payable in connection with our acquisition of exelis, and to fund our optional redemption of our two series of notes described above, we issued debt securities in an aggregate principal amount of $2.4 billion, comprised of several tranches with principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates as follows:
as discussed in note 13: long-term debt in the notes, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we repaid at maturity the entire outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% notes due october 1, 2016.
common stock:    on may 29, 2015, in connection with our acquisition of exelis, we issued 19,270,836 new shares of our common stock as part of the merger consideration payable to exelis shareholders in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. for additional information, see "item 1. business - recent acquisitions and divestitures" of this report.

(1) the purchase obligations of $1.0 billion included $166 million of purchase obligations related to cost-plus type contracts where our costs are fully reimbursable.
(2) amount includes fiscal 2018 minimum contributions to a non-u.s. pension plan. contributions beyond fiscal 2018 have not been determined. during fiscal 2017, we made a voluntary contribution of $400 million to our u.s. qualified pension plans, and as a result, we currently do not anticipate making any contributions to our u.s. qualified pension plans during fiscal 2018.
(3) the above table does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $90 million.
off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules, any of the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:
•   a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets;
•   any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material to, the registrant, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or r&amp;d services with the registrant.
as of june 30, 2017, we were not participating in any material transactions that generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we did not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. as of june 30, 2017, we did not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and we were not a party to any related party transactions that materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
we have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses and assets. in connection with these divestitures, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. we cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. we do not believe, however, that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. if any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. we believe that the financial risk of default by such sublessees is individually and in the aggregate not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
commercial commitments we have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services to customers or to obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers. at june 30, 2017, we had commercial commitments on outstanding surety bonds, standby letters of credit and other arrangements, as follows:
expiration of commitmentsby fiscal year total               2018                2019                2020        after 2020

total commitments                        $781              $591                 $99                 $43             $48
the surety bonds and standby letters of credit used for performance are primarily related to public safety and professional communications. as is customary in bidding for and completing network infrastructure projects for public safety systems, contractors are required to procure surety bonds and/or standby letters of credit for bids, performance, warranty and other purposes (collectively, "performance bonds"). such performance bonds normally have maturities of up to three years and are standard in the industry as a way to provide customers a mechanism to seek redress if a contractor does not satisfy performance requirements under a contract. typically, a customer is permitted to draw on a performance bond if we do not fulfill all terms of a project contract. in such an event, we would be obligated to reimburse the financial institution that issued the performance bond for the amounts paid. it has been rare for our public safety and professional communications business to have a performance bond drawn upon. in addition, pursuant to the terms under which we procure performance bonds, if our credit ratings are lowered to below "investment grade," we may be required to provide collateral to support a portion of the outstanding amount of performance bonds. such a downgrade could increase the cost of the issuance of performance bonds and could make it more difficult to procure performance bonds, which would adversely impact our ability to compete for contract awards. such collateral requirements could also result in less liquidity for other operational needs or corporate purposes. in addition, any future disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in financial and insurance markets could also adversely affect our ability to obtain performance bonds and may result in higher funding costs.
financial risk management in the normal course of business, we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.
foreign exchange and currency:    we use foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments. factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales estimates, volatility of currency markets (particularly with respect to the united kingdom due to brexit) and the cost and availability of hedging instruments. a 10 percent change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at june 30, 2017 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of such instruments or our results of operations or cash flows. this quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign currency financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm commitments. see note 20: derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes for additional information.
interest rates:    as of june 30, 2017, we had long-term fixed-rate debt obligations. the fair value of these obligations is impacted by changes in interest rates; however, a 10 percent change in interest rates for our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations at june 30, 2017 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of these obligations. additionally, there is no interest-rate risk associated with these obligations on our results of operations and cash flows,
because the interest rates are fixed, and because our long-term fixed-rate debt is not putable to us (i.e., not required to be redeemed by us prior to maturity). we can give no assurances, however, that interest rates will not change significantly or have a material effect on the fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations over the next twelve months.
as of june 30, 2017, we also had long-term variable-rate debt obligations of $305 million under our senior unsecured term loan facility in connection with our acquisition of exelis, comprised of term loans of $36 million in a 3-year tranche due may 29, 2018 and $269 million in a 5-year tranche due may 29, 2020. these term loans bear interest that is variable based on certain short-term indices, thus exposing us to interest-rate risk; however, a 10 percent change in interest rates for these term loans at june 30, 2017 would not have had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. we have the ability at any time or from time to time, to voluntarily prepay term loans of either tranche in whole or in part without premium or penalty. as a result of our prepayments, we have effectively prepaid all mandatory quarterly principal amortization payments and are no longer required to make such payments for the remaining term until maturity on each tranche of the term loans. see note 13: long-term debt in the notes for further information.
as of june 30, 2017, we also had short-term variable-rate debt outstanding, primarily under our commercial paper program, subject to interest rate risk. we utilize our commercial paper program to satisfy short-term cash requirements, including bridge financing for strategic acquisitions until longer-term financing arrangements are put in place, temporarily funding repurchases under our share repurchase programs and temporarily funding redemption of long-term debt. the interest rate risk associated with such debt on our results of operations and cash flows is not material due to its temporary nature.
impact of foreign exchange approximately 20 percent of our international business was transacted in local currency environments in fiscal 2017 compared with 16 percent in fiscal 2016. the impact of translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to u.s. dollars is included as a component of shareholders' equity. as of june 30, 2017, the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment included in shareholders' equity was a $113 million loss compared with a $131 million loss at july 1, 2016. we utilize foreign currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of international transactions. gains and losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on our results in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
impact of inflation to the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services. inflation and changing prices did not materially adversely impact our gross margin, revenue or operating income in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.
critical accounting policies and estimates the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies or estimates. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1: significant accounting policies in the notes. in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in the notes. we consider the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results dependent on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations are discussed throughout this md&a where such estimates affect our reported and expected financial results. senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the audit committee of our board of directors. preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. actual results may differ from those estimates.
besides estimates that meet the "critical" accounting estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. all estimates, whether or not deemed "critical," affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates that we do not deem "critical."
revenue recognition a significant portion of our business is derived from development and production contracts. revenue and profits related to development and production contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, generally based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion (i.e., the "cost-to-cost" method) or the ratio of actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered under the contract (i.e., the "units-of-delivery" method) with consideration given for risk of performance and estimated profit. the majority of the revenue in our space and intelligence systems and electronic systems segments (and to a certain extent, revenue in our communication systems segment) relates to development and production contracts, and the percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition is primarily used for these contracts. change orders, claims or other items that may change the scope of a development and production contract are included in contract value only when the value can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. possible incentives or penalties and award fees applicable to performance on development and production contracts are considered in estimating contract value and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance. incentive provisions that increase earnings based solely on a single significant event generally are not recognized until the event occurs. we are party to certain contracts with incentive provisions or award fees that are subject to uncertainty until the conclusion of the contract, and our customers may be entitled to reclaim and receive previous award fee payments.
under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each development and production contract over its period of performance. recognition of profit on development and production fixed-price contracts requires estimates of the total cost at completion and the measurement of progress toward completion. the estimated profit or loss on a development and production contract is equal to the difference between the estimated contract value and the estimated total cost at completion. due to the long-term nature of many of our programs, developing the estimated total cost at completion often requires judgment. factors that must be considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, subcontractor performance, the risk and impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer and the recoverability of any claims outside the original development and production contract included in the estimate to complete. at the outset of each contract, we gauge its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total cost at completion in line with these expectations. after establishing the estimated total cost at completion, we follow a standard estimate at completion process in which we review the progress and performance on our ongoing development and production contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. if we successfully retire risks associated with the technical, schedule and cost aspects of a contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the retirement of these risks. conversely, if we are not successful in retiring these risks, we may increase our estimated total cost at completion. additionally, at the outset of a cost-reimbursable contract (for example, contracts containing award or incentive fees), we establish an estimate of total contract value, or revenue, based on our expectation of performance on the contract. as the cost-reimbursable contract progresses, our estimates of total contract value may increase or decrease if, for example, we receive higher or lower than expected award fees. when adjustments in estimated total costs at completion or in estimated total contract value are determined, the related impact to operating income is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of such adjustments for all prior periods. anticipated losses on development and production contracts or programs in progress are charged to operating income when identified. we have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to recognize revenue on development and production contracts or to estimate our costs related to development and production contracts in the past three fiscal years.
estimate at completion adjustments had the following impacts to operating income for the periods presented:
there were no individual impacts to operating income due to estimate at completion adjustments in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015 that were material to our results of operations on a consolidated or segment basis for such periods.
we also recognize revenue from arrangements requiring the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables or elements under a bundled sale. in these arrangements, judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and the timing of revenue recognition for each deliverable. if we determine that individual deliverables represent separate units of accounting, we recognize the revenue associated with each unit of accounting separately, and contract revenue is allocated among the separate units of accounting at the inception of the arrangement based on relative selling price. if
options or change orders materially change the scope of work or price of the contract subsequent to inception, we reevaluate and adjust our prior conclusions regarding units of accounting and allocation of contract revenue as necessary. the allocation of selling price among the separate units of accounting may impact the timing of revenue recognition, but will not change the total revenue recognized on the arrangement. we establish the selling price used for each deliverable based on the vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe") of selling price, or third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price if vsoe of selling price is not available, or best estimate of selling price ("besp") if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price is available. in determining vsoe of selling price, a substantial majority of the recent standalone sales of the deliverable must be priced within a relatively narrow range. in determining tpe of selling price, we evaluate competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. generally, comparable pricing of our products to those of our competitors with similar functionality cannot be obtained. in determining besp, we consider both market data and entity-specific factors, including market conditions, the geographies in which our products are sold, our competitive position and strategy, and our profit objectives.
the fasb has issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap and will be effective for us in fiscal 2019. see note 2: accounting changes or recent accounting pronouncements in the notes for additional information.
postretirement benefit plans former exelis employees participate in numerous defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, referred to as "defined benefit plans") in the united states, which are sponsored by harris. the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to defined benefit pension plans are dependent on various assumptions. these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, long-term expected rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, termination and other factors (some of which are disclosed in note 14: pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes). actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized for each plan to the extent required over the estimated future life expectancy or, if applicable, the future working lifetime of the plan's active participants. in fiscal 2017, we adopted updated mortality tables, which resulted in a decrease in the defined benefit plans' projected benefit obligation as of june 30, 2017 and estimated net periodic benefit cost beginning fiscal 2018.
significant assumptions we develop assumptions using relevant experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each plan. assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as appropriate. the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost as they pertain to our defined benefit pension plans.
cost assumptions for fiscal years:                  2017   2016
expected return on plan assets                     7.65%               7.91%
key assumptions for the u.s. salaried retirement plan ("u.s. srp") (our largest defined benefit plan with approximately 90% of the total projected benefit obligation) included a discount rate for obligation assumptions of 3.78% and expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for fiscal 2017, which is being maintained at 7.75% for fiscal 2018. effective december 31, 2016, accruals under the u.s. srp benefit formula were frozen for all employees and replaced with a 1% cash balance benefit formula for certain non-highly compensated employees.
expected return on plan assets substantially all of our plan assets are managed on a commingled basis in a master investment trust. we determine our expected return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. specifically, we consider the plan's actual historical annual return on assets over the past 15, 20 and 25 years and historical broad market returns over long-term time frames based on our strategic allocation, which is detailed in note 14: pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes. future returns are based on independent estimates of long-term asset class
returns. based on this approach, the long-term annual rate of return on assets was estimated at 7.65% and 7.91% for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.
discount rate the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments at the measurement date. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and generally decreases pension expense. the discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. the pension discount rate is determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaa/aa bonds, with maturities between zero and thirty years, developed by the plan's actuaries. annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single discount rate matching the plan's characteristics.
in fiscal 2017, we changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost of the u.s. defined benefit plans. the new estimation approach discounts the individual expected cash flows underlying the service cost and interest cost using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve used to discount the cash flows used to measure the benefit obligation. prior to fiscal 2017, we estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period.
we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. we accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accordingly have accounted for it prospectively. although the benefit obligation measured under this approach was unchanged, the more granular application of the spot rates reduced the fiscal 2017 service and interest costs for the u.s. defined benefit plans by approximately $46 million as a result of this change.
in tandem with our change to the alternative spot rate approach to estimate service cost and interest cost for fiscal 2017 expense, we changed, as of july 1, 2016, the underlying yield curve from a published median yield curve to our actuaries' above median yield curve to improve our ability to make such estimates. we believe we will be better able to explain changes of individual spot rates between periods with details from our actuaries supporting the underlying yield curve. if we had continued to use a median yield curve, our projected benefit obligation would have been approximately $339 million, or 5 percent, higher as of july 1, 2016.
sensitivity analysis pension expense a 25 basis point change in the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate would have the following effect on the combined u.s. defined benefit pension plans' fiscal 2018 pension expense:
long-term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost   $(11.8        )           $11.8
discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost                        $8.1                      $(8.6         )
projected benefit obligation funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations ("pbo") from the fair value of plan assets. the sensitivity of the pbo to changes in the discount rate varies depending on the magnitude and direction of the change in the discount rate. we estimate that a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate of the combined u.s. defined benefit pension plans would increase the pbo by approximately $167 million and an increase of 25 basis points would decrease the pbo by approximately $159 million.
fair value of plan assets the plan assets of our defined benefit plans comprise a broad range of investments, including domestic and international equity securities, fixed income investments, interests in private equity and hedge funds and cash and cash equivalents.
a portion of our defined benefit plans asset portfolio is comprised of investments in private equity and hedge funds. the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured using the valuation of the underlying investments or at net asset value. however, in certain instances, the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date. consequently, we have estimated adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date. these adjustments consider information received from the asset
managers, as well as general market information. asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices. see note 14: pension and other postretirement benefits in the notes for further information.
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory losses we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market. we balance the need to maintain prudent inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance with the risk of excess or obsolete inventory due to changing technology and customer requirements. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory primarily based on our estimated forecast of product demand, anticipated end of product life and production requirements. the review of excess and obsolete inventory applies to all of our business segments. several factors may influence the sale and use of our inventories, including our decision to exit a product line, technological change and new product development. these factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. additionally, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. in the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to recognize such costs in the "cost of product sales" line item in our consolidated statement of income at the time of such determination. in the case of goods that have been written down below cost, such reduced amount is to be considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. we have not made any material changes in the reserve methodology used to establish our inventory loss reserves during the past three fiscal years.
as of june 30, 2017, our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $52 million, or 12 percent of our gross inventory balance, which compares with our reserve of $51 million, or 11 percent of our gross inventory balance, as of july 1, 2016. we recorded $6 million, $29 million and $2 million in inventory write-downs that either reduced our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory or our income from continuing operations before income taxes during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, including the impact of planned future product launches, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results.
goodwill goodwill in our consolidated balance sheet as of june 30, 2017 and july 1, 2016 was $5,366 million and $5,352 million, respectively. goodwill is not amortized. we perform annual (or under certain circumstances, more frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill. we identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying amount, including goodwill, which is adjusted for allocations of corporate assets and liabilities as appropriate. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
it services goodwill allocation and impairment as described in more detail in note 3: discontinued operations and divestitures in the notes, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell it services on january 26, 2017 and completed the sale on april 28, 2017.
because the then-pending divestiture of it services represented the disposal of a portion of a reporting unit within our former critical networks segment, we assigned $487 million of goodwill to the it services disposal group on a relative fair value basis during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, when the held for sale criteria were met. the fair value of the it services disposal group was determined based on the negotiated selling price, and the fair value of the retained businesses (which comprised the remaining portion of the reporting unit) was determined based on a combination of market-based valuation techniques, utilizing quoted market prices and comparable publicly reported transactions, and projected discounted cash flows. these fair value determinations are categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.
in conjunction with the relative fair value allocation, we tested goodwill assigned to the disposal group and goodwill assigned to the retained businesses for impairment. as a result, we concluded, in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that goodwill and other assets related to it services were impaired as of march 31, 2017, and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $240 million in discontinued operations, $228 million of which related to goodwill. the goodwill impairment charge is non-deductible for tax purposes.
fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 impairment tests we estimate fair values of our reporting units based on projected cash flows, and sales and/or earnings multiples applied to the latest twelve months' sales and earnings of our reporting units. projected cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet metrics reflecting our view of the financial and market conditions of the underlying business; and the resulting cash flows are discounted using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk in the forecasted cash flows. the sales and earnings multiples applied to the sales and earnings of our reporting units are based on current multiples of sales and earnings for similar businesses, and based on sales and earnings multiples paid for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace. we then assess whether any implied control premium, based on a comparison of fair value based purely on our stock price and outstanding shares with fair value determined by using all of the above-described models, is reasonable. we have not made any material changes during the past three fiscal years in the methodology used in the assessment of whether or not goodwill is impaired.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017, we performed our annual impairment tests of our reporting units' goodwill. we completed these tests with no adjustment required to the goodwill of any of our reporting units. as of the date of our fiscal 2017 impairment test, the estimated fair values for each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. however, the fair value of one of the reporting units, which had approximately $1,450 million of goodwill as of june 30, 2017, within our electronic systems segment exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 percent. although no impairment exists for this reporting unit, an impairment of goodwill could result from a number of circumstances, including different assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting units, future deterioration of the business or a sharp increase in interest rates without a corresponding increase in future revenue.
income taxes and tax valuation allowances we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. we have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to determine our tax valuation allowances during the past three fiscal years.
our consolidated balance sheet as of june 30, 2017 included deferred tax assets of $409 million and deferred tax liabilities of $34 million. this compares with deferred tax assets of $549 million and deferred tax liabilities of $4 million as of july 1, 2016. for all jurisdictions for which we have net deferred tax assets, we expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income needed to realize these tax assets. our valuation allowance related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, was $183 million as of june 30, 2017 and $271 million as of july 1, 2016. the decrease in valuation allowance was primarily due to our divestitures of it services and caprock in fiscal 2017, which allowed us to utilize capital loss carryforwards, which had a full valuation allowance against tax gains on those transactions. although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss in certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the potential impact of tax planning strategies changes, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results.
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued but have not yet been implemented by us are described in note 2: accounting changes or recent accounting pronouncements in the notes, which describes the potential impact that these pronouncements are expected to have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

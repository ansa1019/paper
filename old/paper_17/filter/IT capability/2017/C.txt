management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary as described further throughout this executive summary, citi reported balanced operating results for full-year 2017, reflecting continued momentum across businesses and geographies, notably many of those where citi has been making investments.
during 2017, citi had revenue and loan growth and positive operating leverage as well as operating margin expansion in the institutional clients group (icg) and every region in global consumer banking (gcb). citi also continued to demonstrate strong expense discipline, resulting in an operating efficiency ratio of 58% in 2017. results in 2017 also included an updated estimate for a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion related to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act (tax reform), which impacted the tax line within corporate/other, as well as the tax lines in north america gcb and icg (for additional information on this updated estimate, see "impact of tax reform" below).
in 2017, citi increased the amount of capital returned to shareholders, while each of its key regulatory capital metrics remained strong (see "capital" below). during the year, citi returned approximately $17.1 billion in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends and repurchased approximately 214 million common shares as outstanding common shares declined 7% from the prior year.
going into 2018, while economic sentiment has improved and the macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, there continue to be various economic, political and other risks and uncertainties that could impact citi's businesses and future results. for a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2018, see each respective business's results of operations, "risk factors" and "managing global risk" below. despite these risks and uncertainties, citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2017 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders.
2017 summary results citigroup citigroup reported a net loss of $6.8 billion, or $2.98 per share, compared to net income of $14.9 billion, or $4.72 per share, in the prior year. excluding the impact of tax reform, citigroup net income of $15.8 billion increased 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit, while earnings per share increased 13%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average shares outstanding. (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of tax reform are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of tax reform provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.) for additional information regarding the impact of tax reform, see "impact of tax reform," "risk factors,"
"significant accounting policies and significant estimates-income taxes" below and notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
citigroup revenues of $71.4 billion in 2017 increased 2%, driven by 6% aggregate growth in icg and gcb, partially offset by a 40% decrease in corporate/other, primarily due to the continued wind-down of legacy assets.
citigroup's end-of-period loans increased 7% to $667 billion versus the prior-year period. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation in u.s. dollars for reporting purposes (fx translation), citigroup's end-of-period loans grew 5%, as 9% growth in icg and 4% growth in gcb was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in corporate/other (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses). citigroup's end-of-period deposits increased 3% to $960 billion versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, citigroup's deposits were up 1%, as a 2% increase in icg deposits was partially offset by a decline in corporate/ other deposits, and gcb deposits were largely unchanged.
expenses citigroup operating expenses were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as the impact of higher volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets. year-over-year, icg operating expenses were up 3% and gcb operating expenses increased 2%, while corporate/other operating expenses declined 24%, all versus the prior year.
cost of credit citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.5 billion increased 7% from the prior year. the increase was mostly driven by a $515 million increase in net credit losses, primarily in north america gcb, partially offset by a lower provision for benefits and claims due to continued legacy asset divestitures within corporate/other. the net loan loss reserve build of $266 million compared to a net loan loss reserve build of $217 million in the prior year. the increase was mostly due to volume growth and seasoning, as well as the impact of loan loss reserve builds related to forward-looking net credit loss expectations, all in the north america cards portfolios, partially offset by a higher net reserve release in icg.
net credit losses of $7.1 billion increased 8% versus the prior year. consumer net credit losses increased 11% to
$6.7 billion, mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning in the north america cards portfolios and the impact of acquiring the costco portfolio. the increase in consumer net credit losses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in corporate/other. corporate net credit losses
decreased 26% to $379 million, largely driven by improvement in the energy sector.

capital citigroup's common equity tier 1 capital and tier 1 capital ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 12.4% and 14.1% as of december 31, 2017 (based on the basel iii standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets), respectively, compared to 12.6% and 14.2% as of december 31, 2016 (based on the basel iii advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets). the decline in regulatory capital reflected the return of capital to common shareholders and an approximately $6 billion reduction in common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital due to the impact of tax reform, partially offset by earnings growth. citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2017, on a fully implemented basis, was 6.7%, compared to 7.2% as of december 31, 2016. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, including the impact of tax reform on its capital ratios, see "capital resources" below.
global consumer banking gcb net income decreased 21%. excluding the impact of tax reform, gcb net income decreased 6%, as higher revenues were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. operating expenses were $17.8 billion, up 2%, as higher volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
gcb revenues of $32.7 billion increased 4% versus the prior year, driven by growth across all regions. north america gcb revenues increased 3% to $20.3 billion, driven by higher revenues across all businesses. citi-branded cards revenues of $8.6 billion were up 5% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting the addition of the costco portfolio as well as modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios as well as a higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, given higher interest rates. citi retail services revenues of $6.4 billion increased 1% versus the prior year, as continued loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the renewal and extension of certain partnerships, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016. retail banking revenues increased 1% from the prior year to $5.3 billion. excluding mortgage revenues, retail banking revenues of $4.5 billion were up 9% from the prior year, driven by continued growth in loans and assets under management, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates.
north america gcb average deposits of $184 billion increased 1% year-over-year, average retail loans of $56 billion grew 3% and assets under management of $60 billion grew 14%. average citi-branded card loans of $85 billion increased 15%, while citi-branded card purchase sales of $320 billion increased 28% versus the prior year. average citi retail services loans of $46 billion increased 4% versus the prior year, while retail services purchase sales of $81 billion were up 2%. for additional information on the results of operations of north america gcb for 2017, see "global consumer banking-north america gcb" below.
international gcb revenues (consisting of latin america gcb and asia gcb (which includes the results of operations in certain emea countries)) increased 6% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion. excluding the impact of fx translation, international gcb revenues increased 5% versus the prior year. latin america gcb revenues increased 6% versus the prior year, driven by growth in loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads. asia gcb revenues increased 5% (4% excluding modest gains on the sales of merchant acquiring businesses in the second and fourth quarters of 2017) versus the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in cards revenues and wealth management revenues, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. for additional information on the results of operations of latin america gcb and asia gcb for 2017, including the impact of fx translation, see "global consumer banking-latin america gcb" and "global consumer banking-asia gcb" below.
year-over-year, international gcb average deposits of $122 billion increased 5%, average retail loans of $87 billion were largely unchanged, assets under management of $101 billion increased 14%, average card loans of $24 billion increased 5% and card purchase sales of $98 billion increased 7%, all excluding the impact of fx translation.
institutional clients group icg net income decreased 5%. excluding the impact of tax reform, icg net income increased 16%, driven by higher revenues and a small benefit to cost of credit (compared to a $486 million cost of credit in the prior year), partially offset by higher operating expenses. icg operating expenses increased 3% to $19.6 billion, as higher compensation, investments and volume-related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings.
icg revenues were $35.7 billion in 2017, up 7% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 16% increase in banking revenues. markets and securities services were largely unchanged versus the prior year. the increase in banking revenues included the impact of $133 million of losses on loan hedges within corporate lending, compared to losses of $594 million in the prior year.

private bank revenues increased 14% from the prior year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits, as well as improved spreads. corporate lending revenues increased 59% to $1.8 billion. excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues increased 12% versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower hedging costs,
as well as the prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing. treasury and trade solutions revenues of $8.5 billion increased 7% versus the prior year, reflecting volume growth and improved spreads, with balanced growth across net interest and fee income.
markets and securities services revenues of $17.1 billion were largely unchanged from the prior year, as a decline in fixed income markets and equity markets revenues was offset by an increase in securities services revenues as well as a $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business. fixed income markets revenues of $12.1 billion decreased 6% from the prior year, reflecting low volatility, as well as the comparison to higher revenues from a more robust trading environment in the prior year following the vote in the u.k. in favor of its withdrawal from the european union, as well as the u.s. election. equity markets revenues of $2.7 billion decreased 2% from the prior year, driven by an episodic loss in derivatives of roughly $130 million related to a single client event. excluding this item, equity markets revenues increased 2% from the prior year, driven by growth in client balances and higher investor client revenue. securities services revenues of $2.3 billion increased 8%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. for additional information on the results of operations of icg for 2017, see "institutional clients group" below.
corporate/other corporate/other net loss was $19.7 billion in 2017, compared to net income of $498 million in the prior year. excluding the impact of tax reform, corporate/other net income declined 69% to $153 million, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower cost of credit. operating expenses of $3.8 billion declined 24% from the prior-year period, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses.
corporate/other revenues were $3.1 billion, down 40% from the prior year, primarily reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets as well as the absence of gains related to debt buybacks in 2016.
corporate/other end-of-period assets of $77 billion decreased 25% from the prior year, reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets as well as the impact of tax reform, which reduced assets by approximately $20 billion. for additional information on the results of operations of corporate/other for 2017, see "corporate/other" below.
impact of tax reform citi's full-year 2017 results included the updated estimate for a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion, recorded within corporate/other, north america gcb and icg related to the enactment of tax reform, which was signed into law on december 22, 2017. this updated estimate resulted in a downward adjustment to fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 financial results, as well as changes in the segments where the impact was recorded (previously, the entire charge was recorded in corporate/other), from those reported on january 16, 2018, by an aggregate of $594 million due to refinements of original estimates. the approximate $6 billion reduction in cet1 capital due to the impact of tax reform was unchanged.
this charge was composed of a $12.4 billion remeasurement of citi's deferred tax assets (dtas) due to the reduction to the u.s. corporate tax rate and the change to a quasi-territorial tax system (see "significant accounting policies and estimates-income taxes" below), a $7.9 billion valuation allowance against citi's foreign tax credit (ftc) carry-forwards and its u.s. residual dtas related to its non-u.s. branches, and a $2.3 billion reduction in citi's ftc carry-forwards related to the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries.
the financial results in the table below disclose the as-reported gaap results for 2017 and 2016, the impact of tax reform and the 2017 adjusted results excluding the impact of tax reform. the charge related to tax reform is reflected in citi's results throughout this annual report on form 10-k, unless otherwise noted.
the final impact of tax reform may differ from the estimate due to, among other things, changes in assumptions made by citigroup and additional guidance that may be issued by the u.s. department of the treasury. for more information on possible changes to the estimated impact related to tax reform, see "risk factors-strategic risks" below and notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

north america gcb north america gcb provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, citi-branded cards products and citi retail services card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable, in the u.s. north america gcb's u.s. cards product portfolio includes its proprietary portfolio (including the citi double cash, thank you and value cards) and co-branded cards (including, among others, american airlines and costco) within citi-branded cards as well as its co-brand and private label relationships (including, among others, sears, the home depot, best buy and macy's) within citi retail services.
as previously announced, the hilton honors co-brand credit card partnership with citi was scheduled to terminate as of year-end 2017. on october 23, 2017, citi signed an agreement to sell the hilton credit card portfolio (approximately $1.1 billion in outstanding loan balances in citi-branded cards as of december 31, 2017) to american express. in connection with the sale agreement, the existing partnership was extended through the closing date. the sale was completed on january 30, 2018, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $150 million, which approximates one year of revenues from the portfolio. the sale will impact north america gcb's quarterly comparisons in 2018.
as of december 31, 2017, north america gcb's 694 retail bank branches are concentrated in the six key metropolitan areas of new york, chicago, miami, washington, d.c., los angeles and san francisco. also as of december 31, 2017, north america gcb had approximately 9.2 million retail banking customer accounts, $56.0 billion in retail banking loans and $182.5 billion in deposits. in addition, north america gcb had approximately 121 million citi-branded and citi retail services credit card accounts with $139.7 billion in outstanding card loan balances.

net income decreased 37% and was impacted by an estimated $750 million non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of tax reform (for additional information, see "impact of tax reform" above). excluding the impact of tax reform, net income decreased 14% due to higher cost of credit and slightly higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 3%, driven by higher revenues across all businesses.
retail banking revenues increased 1%. excluding the decline in mortgage revenues (down of 32%), retail banking revenues were up 9%, driven by growth in checking deposits, continued growth in loans (average loans up 3%) and assets under management (up 14%) and increased commercial banking activity, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates. the decline in mortgage revenues was driven by lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, reflecting the higher interest rate environment, as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of citi's mortgage servicing rights.
cards revenues increased 3%. in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the costco portfolio (completed june 17, 2016), as well as modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios and the higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, given the higher interest rates. average loans grew 15% and purchase sales grew 28%. north america gcb expects that additional terms in certain partnership contracts that go into effect in 2018 will negatively impact citi-branded cards revenues going forward.
citi retail services revenues increased 1%, as continued loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed renewal and extension of certain partnerships within the portfolio, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016. average loans grew 4% and purchase sales grew 2%.
expenses increased 1%, driven by the addition of the costco portfolio, higher volume-related expenses and investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. also included in expenses is an $80 million provision for remediation costs related to a credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act (card act) matter (for additional information, see "corporate/other" below and note 27 to the consolidated financial statements).
provisions increased 24% from the prior year, driven by higher net credit losses and a higher net loan loss reserve build.
net credit losses increased 22% to $4.8 billion, largely driven by higher net credit losses in citi-branded cards (up 28% to $2.4 billion) and citi retail services (up 19% to $2.2 billion). the increase in net credit losses primarily reflected volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as well as the impact of acquiring the costco portfolio in citi-branded cards.
the net loan loss reserve build in 2017 was $873 million (compared to a build of $659 million in the prior year), driven by volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as well as the increase in net flow rates in later delinquency buckets leading to higher inherent credit loss expectations, primarily in citi retail services.
for additional information on north america gcb's retail banking portfolios, including commercial banking, and its citi-branded cards and citi retail services portfolios, see "credit risk-consumer credit" below.
net income decreased by 23% due to significantly higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 1%, reflecting higher revenues in citi-branded cards, partially offset by lower revenues in retail banking and citi retail services. retail banking revenues decreased 2%. excluding the previously disclosed $110 million gain on sale of branches in texas in the first quarter of 2015, retail banking revenues were largely unchanged, as lower mortgage revenues were offset by continued volume growth, including growth in average loans (9%) and average checking deposits (9%).
cards revenues increased 2%. in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the costco portfolio as well as volume growth, partially offset by higher investment-related acquisition and rewards costs and the impact of higher promotional balances. citi retail services revenues decreased 1%, as the impact of the renewal and extension of several partnerships within the portfolio as well as the absence of revenues from portfolio exits were partially offset by modest growth in average loans.
expenses increased 7%, primarily due to the costco acquisition, continued investment spending, volume growth, higher repositioning charges and regulatory and compliance costs, partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and lower legal and related costs.
provisions increased 33%, driven by a net loan loss reserve build, compared to a loan loss reserve release in the prior year, and higher net credit losses. the net loan loss reserve build mostly reflected reserve builds in the cards portfolios and was primarily driven by the impact of the acquisition of the costco portfolio, as well as volume growth and seasoning of the portfolios and the absence of nearly $400 million of reserve releases in 2015 as credit normalized. the reserve build was also due to the estimated impact of proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party debt collections.
the increase in net credit losses was driven by increases in cards and retail banking. in retail banking, net credit losses grew 37%, primarily due to an increase related to citi's energy and energy-related exposures within the commercial banking portfolio, which was largely offset by releases of previously established loan loss reserves. in citi-branded cards, net credit losses increased 1%, driven by volume growth, including the impact of costco beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections. in citi retail services, net credit losses increased 6%, primarily due to portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections.

net income decreased 5%, primarily driven by higher credit costs and expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
retail banking revenues increased 8%, reflecting continued growth in volumes, including an increase in average deposits (8%), average loans (6%), reflecting growth across most portfolios, an increase in assets under management (6%), as well as improved deposit spreads, driven by higher interest rates. cards revenues were largely unchanged, as continued improvement in full-rate revolving loans in the second half of 2017 was offset by a higher cost to fund non-revolving loans. purchase sales grew 8% and average card loans grew 5%.
expenses increased 4%, as ongoing investment spending and business growth were partially offset by efficiency savings. citi continues to execute on its investment plans for citibanamex (totaling more than $1 billion through 2020), including initiatives to modernize the branch network, enhance digital capabilities and upgrade core operating platforms.
provisions increased 12%, primarily driven by higher net credit losses (8%) and a $42 million increase in the net loan loss reserve build, largely reflecting volume growth and seasoning. the increase in the loan loss reserve build was also driven by a mexico earthquake-related loan loss reserve build in the third quarter of 2017 (approximately $25 million).

net income increased 15%, reflecting higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.
revenues increased 5%, driven by improvement in cards and wealth management revenues, partially offset by continued lower retail lending revenues.
retail banking revenues increased 3%, primarily due to the continued improvement in wealth management revenues, partially offset by the repositioning of the retail loan portfolio. wealth management revenues increased due to improvement in investor sentiment, stronger equity markets and increases in assets under management (18%) and investment sales (38%). average deposits increased 5%. the increase in revenues was partially offset by the lower retail lending revenues (down 4%), reflecting continued lower average loans (1%) due to the continued optimization of this portfolio away from lower yielding mortgage loans to focus on growing higher-return personal loans.
cards revenues increased 8%, reflecting 5% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales, both of which benefited from the previously disclosed portfolio acquisition in australia in 2017, as well as modest gains in 2017 related to sales of merchant acquiring businesses in certain countries.
expenses increased 2%, resulting from volume growth and ongoing investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions decreased 2%, primarily driven by a decrease in net credit losses.
for additional information on asia gcb's retail banking portfolios, including commercial banking, and its citi-branded cards portfolio, see "credit risk-consumer credit" below.
revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower retail banking revenues, partially offset by higher cards revenues. retail banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a 5% decrease in wealth management revenues due to lower client activity, modestly lower investment assets under management and a decline in average loans. the decline in revenues was partially offset by growth in deposit volumes and higher insurance revenues. cards revenues increased 1%, driven by continued improvement in yields, modestly abating regulatory headwinds and modest volume growth due to continued stabilizing payment rates.
expenses increased 2%, primarily due to higher repositioning costs, higher regulatory and compliance costs and increased investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions were largely unchanged as lower net loan loss reserve releases were offset by lower net credit losses, primarily in the commercial portfolio.
institutional clients group institutional clients group (icg) includes banking and markets and securities services (for additional information on these businesses, see "citigroup segments" above). icg provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. icg transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.
icg revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. icg earns fee income for assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. revenue generated from these activities is recorded in commissions and fees and investment banking. revenue is also generated from transaction processing and assets under custody and administration. revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in administration and other fiduciary fees. in addition, as a market maker, icg facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions (for additional information on principal transactions revenue, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). other primarily includes mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives, gains and losses on available-for-sale (afs) securities and other non-recurring gains and losses. interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid to customers on deposits and long- and short-term debt, is recorded as net interest revenue.
the amount and types of markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. however, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. for example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.
icg's management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluating of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level. icg does not separately track the impact on total markets revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the markets businesses at an aggregate level.
in the markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (for example, holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.
icg's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 98 countries and jurisdictions. at december 31, 2017, icg had approximately $1.3 trillion of assets and $640 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses-securities services and issuer services-managed approximately $17.4 trillion of assets under custody compared to $15.2 trillion at the end of the prior-year period.

(1)   credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. gains (losses) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. the fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. citigroup's results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-gaap financial measures.
(2)   excludes cva/dva in 2015, consistent with current presentation. for additional information, see notes 1 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)   2017 includes the $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business. 2016 includes a charge of approximately $180 million, primarily reflecting the write-down of citi's net investment in venezuela as a result of changes in the exchange rate.
(4) excludes principal transactions revenues of icg businesses other than markets, primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
the discussion of the results of operations for icg below excludes the impact of cva/dva for 2015. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of cva/dva and the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income decreased 5% and was impacted by an estimated $2.0 billion non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of tax reform (for additional information, see "impact of tax reform" above). excluding the impact of tax reform, net income increased 16%, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.
•   revenues increased 7%, reflecting a 16% increase in banking (including the losses on loan hedges). excluding the impact of the losses on loan hedges, banking revenues increased 12%, driven by solid growth across all products. markets and securities services were largely unchanged, as growth in securities services revenues (increase of 8%) as well as the $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business were offset by a 6% decrease in fixed income markets and a 2% decrease in equity markets revenues.
within banking:
•   investment banking revenues increased 20%, largely reflecting gains in wallet share across products and regions as well as an improvement from the industry-wide slowdown in activity levels during the first half of 2016, particularly in equity underwriting and advisory. advisory revenues increased 11%, driven by north america and emea, reflecting wallet share gains and the increased market activity. equity underwriting revenues increased 68%, driven by strength in north america and emea, due to significant wallet share gains as well as the increase in overall market activity. debt underwriting revenues increased 13%, reflecting strength across regions, primarily driven by wallet share gains.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 7%, reflecting growth across all regions that was balanced across both net interest and fee income. the increase was primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients, continued growth in deposit balances and improved spreads in certain regions. the trade business experienced modest revenue growth, as continued focus on high-quality loan growth was largely offset by industry-wide tightening of spreads. average deposit balances increased 4%, while average trade loans increased 5% (4% excluding the impact of fx translation).
•   corporate lending revenues increased 59%. excluding the impact of losses on loans hedges, revenues increased 12%, driven by lower hedging costs and the absence of a prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing transaction.
•   private bank revenues increased 14%, reflecting strength across all regions and products. the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher loan and deposit volumes, higher deposit spreads and increased managed investments and capital markets activity.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues decreased 6%, with lower revenues in all regions, primarily due to low volatility as well as the comparison to higher revenues in the prior year from a more robust trading environment following the vote in the u.k. in favor of its withdrawal from the european union, as well as the u.s. election. the decline in revenues was driven by lower net interest revenue (decreased 22%), largely due to higher funding costs and a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity. the decline was partially offset by higher principal transactions revenues and commissions and fees revenues.
rates and currencies revenues decreased 5%, driven by lower g10 rates and currencies revenues. despite the challenging trading environment, corporate client revenues in rates and currencies across the global network remained strong. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 6%, due to a difficult trading environment in the current year given low volatility, driving lower credit markets and commodities revenues, particularly in north america, partially offset by higher municipals revenues, as well as higher securitized markets revenues.
•   equity markets revenues decreased 2%. excluding an episodic loss in derivatives of approximately $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to a single client event, revenues increased 2%, as continued growth in prime finance and delta one client balances and higher investor client activity (particularly in emea and asia) were partially offset by lower episodic activity with corporate clients in north america. excluding the episodic loss in derivatives, equity derivatives revenues increased, driven by the stronger investor client activity. cash equities revenues were modestly higher as well, driven by higher revenues in asia, partially offset by lower cash commissions, as clients continued to move toward automated execution platforms across the industry.
•   securities services revenues increased 8%. excluding the impact of the prior year's divestiture of a private equity fund services business, revenues increased 12%, reflecting strength in all regions, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue due to a more favorable rate environment.
expenses increased 3%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions improved $501 million, driven by a net loan loss release of $380 million (compared to a net release of $30 million in the prior year) and a 29% decline in net credit
losses. the increase in net loan loss reserve releases was driven by an improvement in the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, as well as a favorable credit environment, stability in commodity prices and continued improvement in the portfolio. the decline in net credit losses was largely driven by improvement in the energy sector, partially offset by the impact of the single client event in the fourth quarter noted above.
net income increased 5%, primarily driven by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.
•   revenues were largely unchanged, reflecting higher revenues in markets and securities services (increase of 6%), driven by fixed income markets, offset by lower revenues in banking (decrease of 4% including the gains (losses) on loan hedges). excluding the impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges, banking revenues increased 1%, driven by treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
within banking:
•   investment banking revenues decreased 6%, largely reflecting the overall industry-wide slowdown in activity levels in equity underwriting and advisory during the first half of 2016. advisory revenues decreased 9%, reflecting strong performance in 2015. equity underwriting revenues decreased 31%, primarily reflecting the lower market activity. debt underwriting revenues increased 5%, primarily due to higher market activity reflecting a favorable interest rate environment.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 6%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 8%, reflecting growth across most regions. the increase was primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes and deposit balances and improved spreads in certain regions. trade revenues increased modestly due to loan growth as well as spread improvements. end-of-period deposit balances increased 5% (6% excluding the impact of fx translation), while average trade loans decreased 2% (1% excluding the impact of fx translation).
•   corporate lending revenues decreased 48%. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 6%. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges and fx translation, revenues decreased 1%, mostly reflecting the adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing transaction, spread compression and higher hedging costs, partially offset by higher average loans.
•   private bank revenues increased 5%, reflecting growth in loan volumes and improved deposit spreads, partially offset by lower capital markets activity and lower managed investments revenues.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues increased 14%, with higher revenues in all regions, largely driven by both higher principal transactions revenues (up 22%) and other revenues (up 79%). the increase in principal transactions revenues was primarily due to higher rates and currencies revenues and higher spread products revenues. other revenues increased mainly due to foreign currency losses in 2015. rates and currencies revenues grew 22%, primarily due to the more favorable trading environment and higher client revenues following the vote in the u.k. and the u.s. election. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 3%, due to lower securitized products revenues, driven by the impact of significantly lower liquidity in the market in the first quarter of 2016.
•   equity markets revenues declined 9%. equity derivatives and prime finance revenues declined 13%, reflecting both a challenging trading environment across all regions driven by lower volatility compared to 2015, and a comparison to a more favorable trading environment in 2015 in asia. the decline in equity markets revenue was also due to lower equity cash commissions driven by a continued shift to electronic trading and passive investing by clients across the industry.
•   securities services revenues increased 2%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 5%, driven by emea, primarily reflecting increased client activity, a modest gain on the sale of a private equity fund services business in the first quarter of 2016, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads. the increase in revenues was partially offset by the absence of revenues from divestitures. excluding the impact of fx translation and divestitures, revenues increased 6%.
expenses decreased 1% as a benefit from fx translation and efficiency savings were partially offset by higher compensation expense and higher repositioning charges.
provisions decreased 49%, driven by a net loan loss reserve release of $30 million (compared to a net build of $748 million in the prior year). the significant decline in loan loss reserve builds was related to energy and energy-related exposures and was driven by stabilization of commodities as oil prices continued to recover from lows in early 2016. the decline in cost of credit was partially offset by higher net credit losses of $516 million (compared to $214 million in the prior year) mostly related to the energy and energy-related exposures, with a vast majority offset by the release of previously established loan loss reserves.
corporate/other corporate/other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses, corporate treasury, certain north america and international legacy consumer loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for additional information on corporate/other, see "citigroup segments" above). at december 31, 2017, corporate/other had $77 billion in assets, a decrease of 25% year-over-year and 23% from september 30, 2017. the decrease in assets included an approximate $20 billion decline in dtas during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the impact of tax reform.

the net loss was $19.7 billion in 2017, compared to net income of $498 million in the prior year, primarily driven by the estimated $19.8 billion non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of tax reform (for additional information, see "impact of tax reform" above). excluding the impact of tax reform, net income declined 69% to $153 million, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.
revenues declined 40%, primarily reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of gains related to debt buybacks in 2016. revenues included approximately $750 million in gains on asset sales in the first quarter of 2017, which more than offset a roughly $300 million charge related to the exit of citi's u.s. mortgage servicing operations in the quarter.
expenses declined 24%, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses, partially offset by approximately $100 million in episodic expenses primarily related to the exit of the u.s. mortgage servicing operations. also included in expenses is an approximately $255 million provision for remediation costs related to a card act matter (for additional information, see "north america gcb" above and note 27 to the consolidated financial statements). citi believes the aggregate approximately $335 million provision (including the $80 million provision in north america gcb) to be sufficient for citi's planned remediation.
provisions decreased $244 million to a net benefit of $175 million, primarily due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. net credit losses declined 66% to $149 million, primarily reflecting the impact of ongoing divestiture activity and the continued wind-down of the north america mortgage portfolio. the provision for benefits and claims declined by $105 million, primarily due to lower insurance activity. the net reserve release declined by $147 million to $317 million, and reflected the continued wind-down of the legacy north america mortgage portfolio and divestitures.
net income was $498 million, compared to net income of $2.0 billion in 2015, primarily reflecting lower revenues and a higher effective tax rate in 2016 due to the absence of certain tax benefits in 2015.
revenues decreased 52%, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of legacy assets and lower net gains on sales, particularly the sales of onemain financial and the retail banking and credit cards businesses in japan in the fourth quarter of 2015.
expenses decreased 32%, reflecting the sales and run-off of assets, lower legal and related expenses and lower repositioning costs.
provisions decreased 95% due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims (decrease of 84%) due to lower insurance activity. net credit losses declined 67%, primarily due to the impact of divestitures and continued credit improvements in north america mortgages.
the selling of ppi by financial institutions in the u.k. has been the subject of intense review and focus by u.k. regulators and the u.k. supreme court.
ppi is designed to cover a customer's loan repayments if certain events occur, such as long-term illness or unemployment.  the u.k. financial conduct authority (fca) found certain problems across the industry with how these products were sold, including customers not realizing that the cost of ppi premiums was being added to their loan or ppi being unsuitable for the customer.  redress generally involves the repayment of premiums and the refund of all applicable contractual interest, together with compensatory interest of 8%.
in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the u.k. supreme court issued a ruling in a case (plevin) involving ppi pursuant to which the court ruled, independent of the sale of the ppi contract, that the ppi contract at issue in the case was "unfair" due to the high sales commissions earned and the lack of disclosure to the customer thereof.
in addition, the fca released a policy statement related to ppi that (i) set a deadline of august 29, 2019 by which consumers must file ppi claims, (ii) provides for the launch of fca-led marketing campaigns to inform consumers of this deadline, (iii) set new rules and guidance for the handling of ppi complaints in light of the supreme court's decision on plevin and (iv) requires all firms to contact all previously rejected customers who may be able to complain under the new "plevin" rule (the plevin customer contact exercise). citi completed the plevin customer contact exercise during the fourth quarter of 2017. the fca-led marketing campaigns began in august 2017 and will continue through the august 2019 deadline. the level of ppi claims also continues to be influenced by the solicitation activity of claims management companies (cmcs).
during 2017, citi increased its ppi reserves by approximately $109 million (with $105 million recorded in corporate/other and $4 million recorded in discontinued operations).  the increase for full-year 2017 compared to an increase of $134 million during 2016 and was primarily due to the ongoing level of ppi claims.
citi's year-end 2017 ppi reserve was $213 million, compared to $228 million as of december 31, 2016.
additional reserving actions, if any, in 2018 will largely depend on the level of customer claims in response to the fca-led marketing campaigns and the level of ongoing cmc activity.
off-balance sheet arrangements citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. citi's involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:
•   purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;
•   holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities;
•   providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and
•   entering into operating leases for property and equipment.
citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. for example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. securitization arrangements also assist citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.
the table below shows where a discussion of citi's various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this form 10-k. in addition, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

(1)   for additional information about long-term debt obligations, see "liquidity risk-long-term debt" below and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
(2)   contractual obligations related to interest payments on long-term debt for 2018-2022 are calculated by applying the december 31, 2017 weighted-average interest rate (3.57%) on average outstanding long-term debt to the average remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years. the "thereafter" interest payments on long-term debt for the remaining years to maturity (2023-2098) are calculated by applying current interest rates on the remaining contractual obligations on long-term debt for each of those years.
(3)   purchase obligations consist of obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on citi. for presentation purposes, purchase obligations are included in the table above through the termination date of the respective agreements, even if the contract is renewable. many of the purchase agreements for goods or services include clauses that would allow citi to cancel the agreement with specified notice, however, that impact is not included in the table above (unless citi has already notified the counterparty of its intention to terminate the agreement).
(4)   other liabilities reflected on citigroup's consolidated balance sheet includes accounts payable, accrued expenses, uncertain tax positions and other liabilities that have been incurred and will ultimately be paid in cash; legal reserve accruals are not included in the table above. also includes discretionary contributions in 2018 for citi's employee-defined benefit obligations for the pension, postretirement and post employment plans and defined contribution plans.
capital resources management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary as described further throughout this executive summary, citi reported balanced operating results for full-year 2017, reflecting continued momentum across businesses and geographies, notably many of those where citi has been making investments.
during 2017, citi had revenue and loan growth and positive operating leverage as well as operating margin expansion in the institutional clients group (icg) and every region in global consumer banking (gcb). citi also continued to demonstrate strong expense discipline, resulting in an operating efficiency ratio of 58% in 2017. results in 2017 also included an updated estimate for a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion related to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act (tax reform), which impacted the tax line within corporate/other, as well as the tax lines in north america gcb and icg (for additional information on this updated estimate, see "impact of tax reform" below).
in 2017, citi increased the amount of capital returned to shareholders, while each of its key regulatory capital metrics remained strong (see "capital" below). during the year, citi returned approximately $17.1 billion in the form of common stock repurchases and dividends and repurchased approximately 214 million common shares as outstanding common shares declined 7% from the prior year.
going into 2018, while economic sentiment has improved and the macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, there continue to be various economic, political and other risks and uncertainties that could impact citi's businesses and future results. for a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could impact citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition during 2018, see each respective business's results of operations, "risk factors" and "managing global risk" below. despite these risks and uncertainties, citi intends to continue to build on the progress made during 2017 with a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders.
2017 summary results citigroup citigroup reported a net loss of $6.8 billion, or $2.98 per share, compared to net income of $14.9 billion, or $4.72 per share, in the prior year. excluding the impact of tax reform, citigroup net income of $15.8 billion increased 6% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit, while earnings per share increased 13%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average shares outstanding. (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of tax reform are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of tax reform provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses.) for additional information regarding the impact of tax reform, see "impact of tax reform," "risk factors,"
"significant accounting policies and significant estimates-income taxes" below and notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
citigroup revenues of $71.4 billion in 2017 increased 2%, driven by 6% aggregate growth in icg and gcb, partially offset by a 40% decrease in corporate/other, primarily due to the continued wind-down of legacy assets.
citigroup's end-of-period loans increased 7% to $667 billion versus the prior-year period. excluding the impact of foreign currency translation in u.s. dollars for reporting purposes (fx translation), citigroup's end-of-period loans grew 5%, as 9% growth in icg and 4% growth in gcb was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in corporate/other (citi's results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation are non-gaap financial measures. citi believes the presentation of its results of operations excluding the impact of fx translation provides a meaningful depiction for investors of the underlying fundamentals of its businesses). citigroup's end-of-period deposits increased 3% to $960 billion versus the prior year. excluding the impact of fx translation, citigroup's deposits were up 1%, as a 2% increase in icg deposits was partially offset by a decline in corporate/ other deposits, and gcb deposits were largely unchanged.
expenses citigroup operating expenses were largely unchanged versus the prior year, as the impact of higher volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets. year-over-year, icg operating expenses were up 3% and gcb operating expenses increased 2%, while corporate/other operating expenses declined 24%, all versus the prior year.
cost of credit citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $7.5 billion increased 7% from the prior year. the increase was mostly driven by a $515 million increase in net credit losses, primarily in north america gcb, partially offset by a lower provision for benefits and claims due to continued legacy asset divestitures within corporate/other. the net loan loss reserve build of $266 million compared to a net loan loss reserve build of $217 million in the prior year. the increase was mostly due to volume growth and seasoning, as well as the impact of loan loss reserve builds related to forward-looking net credit loss expectations, all in the north america cards portfolios, partially offset by a higher net reserve release in icg.
net credit losses of $7.1 billion increased 8% versus the prior year. consumer net credit losses increased 11% to
$6.7 billion, mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning in the north america cards portfolios and the impact of acquiring the costco portfolio. the increase in consumer net credit losses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in corporate/other. corporate net credit losses
decreased 26% to $379 million, largely driven by improvement in the energy sector.
for additional information on citi's consumer and corporate credit costs and allowance for loan losses, see each respective business's results of operations and "credit risk" below.
capital citigroup's common equity tier 1 capital and tier 1 capital ratios, on a fully implemented basis, were 12.4% and 14.1% as of december 31, 2017 (based on the basel iii standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets), respectively, compared to 12.6% and 14.2% as of december 31, 2016 (based on the basel iii advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets). the decline in regulatory capital reflected the return of capital to common shareholders and an approximately $6 billion reduction in common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital due to the impact of tax reform, partially offset by earnings growth. citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio as of december 31, 2017, on a fully implemented basis, was 6.7%, compared to 7.2% as of december 31, 2016. for additional information on citi's capital ratios and related components, including the impact of tax reform on its capital ratios, see "capital resources" below.
global consumer banking gcb net income decreased 21%. excluding the impact of tax reform, gcb net income decreased 6%, as higher revenues were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. operating expenses were $17.8 billion, up 2%, as higher volume-related expenses and continued investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
gcb revenues of $32.7 billion increased 4% versus the prior year, driven by growth across all regions. north america gcb revenues increased 3% to $20.3 billion, driven by higher revenues across all businesses. citi-branded cards revenues of $8.6 billion were up 5% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting the addition of the costco portfolio as well as modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios as well as a higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, given higher interest rates. citi retail services revenues of $6.4 billion increased 1% versus the prior year, as continued loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the renewal and extension of certain partnerships, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016. retail banking revenues increased 1% from the prior year to $5.3 billion. excluding mortgage revenues, retail banking revenues of $4.5 billion were up 9% from the prior year, driven by continued growth in loans and assets under management, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates.
north america gcb average deposits of $184 billion increased 1% year-over-year, average retail loans of $56 billion grew 3% and assets under management of $60 billion grew 14%. average citi-branded card loans of $85 billion increased 15%, while citi-branded card purchase sales of $320 billion increased 28% versus the prior year. average citi retail services loans of $46 billion increased 4% versus the prior year, while retail services purchase sales of $81 billion were up 2%. for additional information on the results of operations of north america gcb for 2017, see "global consumer banking-north america gcb" below.
international gcb revenues (consisting of latin america gcb and asia gcb (which includes the results of operations in certain emea countries)) increased 6% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion. excluding the impact of fx translation, international gcb revenues increased 5% versus the prior year. latin america gcb revenues increased 6% versus the prior year, driven by growth in loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spreads. asia gcb revenues increased 5% (4% excluding modest gains on the sales of merchant acquiring businesses in the second and fourth quarters of 2017) versus the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in cards revenues and wealth management revenues, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. for additional information on the results of operations of latin america gcb and asia gcb for 2017, including the impact of fx translation, see "global consumer banking-latin america gcb" and "global consumer banking-asia gcb" below.
year-over-year, international gcb average deposits of $122 billion increased 5%, average retail loans of $87 billion were largely unchanged, assets under management of $101 billion increased 14%, average card loans of $24 billion increased 5% and card purchase sales of $98 billion increased 7%, all excluding the impact of fx translation.
institutional clients group icg net income decreased 5%. excluding the impact of tax reform, icg net income increased 16%, driven by higher revenues and a small benefit to cost of credit (compared to a $486 million cost of credit in the prior year), partially offset by higher operating expenses. icg operating expenses increased 3% to $19.6 billion, as higher compensation, investments and volume-related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings.
icg revenues were $35.7 billion in 2017, up 7% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 16% increase in banking revenues. markets and securities services were largely unchanged versus the prior year. the increase in banking revenues included the impact of $133 million of losses on loan hedges within corporate lending, compared to losses of $594 million in the prior year.

private bank revenues increased 14% from the prior year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits, as well as improved spreads. corporate lending revenues increased 59% to $1.8 billion. excluding the impact of losses on loan hedges, corporate lending revenues increased 12% versus the prior year, primarily driven by lower hedging costs,
as well as the prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing. treasury and trade solutions revenues of $8.5 billion increased 7% versus the prior year, reflecting volume growth and improved spreads, with balanced growth across net interest and fee income.
markets and securities services revenues of $17.1 billion were largely unchanged from the prior year, as a decline in fixed income markets and equity markets revenues was offset by an increase in securities services revenues as well as a $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business. fixed income markets revenues of $12.1 billion decreased 6% from the prior year, reflecting low volatility, as well as the comparison to higher revenues from a more robust trading environment in the prior year following the vote in the u.k. in favor of its withdrawal from the european union, as well as the u.s. election. equity markets revenues of $2.7 billion decreased 2% from the prior year, driven by an episodic loss in derivatives of roughly $130 million related to a single client event. excluding this item, equity markets revenues increased 2% from the prior year, driven by growth in client balances and higher investor client revenue. securities services revenues of $2.3 billion increased 8%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. for additional information on the results of operations of icg for 2017, see "institutional clients group" below.
corporate/other corporate/other net loss was $19.7 billion in 2017, compared to net income of $498 million in the prior year. excluding the impact of tax reform, corporate/other net income declined 69% to $153 million, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower cost of credit. operating expenses of $3.8 billion declined 24% from the prior-year period, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses.
corporate/other revenues were $3.1 billion, down 40% from the prior year, primarily reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets as well as the absence of gains related to debt buybacks in 2016.
corporate/other end-of-period assets of $77 billion decreased 25% from the prior year, reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets as well as the impact of tax reform, which reduced assets by approximately $20 billion. for additional information on the results of operations of corporate/other for 2017, see "corporate/other" below.
impact of tax reform citi's full-year 2017 results included the updated estimate for a one-time, non-cash charge of $22.6 billion, recorded within corporate/other, north america gcb and icg related to the enactment of tax reform, which was signed into law on december 22, 2017. this updated estimate resulted in a downward adjustment to fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 financial results, as well as changes in the segments where the impact was recorded (previously, the entire charge was recorded in corporate/other), from those reported on january 16, 2018, by an aggregate of $594 million due to refinements of original estimates. the approximate $6 billion reduction in cet1 capital due to the impact of tax reform was unchanged.
this charge was composed of a $12.4 billion remeasurement of citi's deferred tax assets (dtas) due to the reduction to the u.s. corporate tax rate and the change to a quasi-territorial tax system (see "significant accounting policies and estimates-income taxes" below), a $7.9 billion valuation allowance against citi's foreign tax credit (ftc) carry-forwards and its u.s. residual dtas related to its non-u.s. branches, and a $2.3 billion reduction in citi's ftc carry-forwards related to the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries.
the financial results in the table below disclose the as-reported gaap results for 2017 and 2016, the impact of tax reform and the 2017 adjusted results excluding the impact of tax reform. the charge related to tax reform is reflected in citi's results throughout this annual report on form 10-k, unless otherwise noted.
the final impact of tax reform may differ from the estimate due to, among other things, changes in assumptions made by citigroup and additional guidance that may be issued by the u.s. department of the treasury. for more information on possible changes to the estimated impact related to tax reform, see "risk factors-strategic risks" below and notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

north america gcb north america gcb provides traditional retail banking, including commercial banking, citi-branded cards products and citi retail services card products to retail customers and small to mid-size businesses, as applicable, in the u.s. north america gcb's u.s. cards product portfolio includes its proprietary portfolio (including the citi double cash, thank you and value cards) and co-branded cards (including, among others, american airlines and costco) within citi-branded cards as well as its co-brand and private label relationships (including, among others, sears, the home depot, best buy and macy's) within citi retail services.
as previously announced, the hilton honors co-brand credit card partnership with citi was scheduled to terminate as of year-end 2017. on october 23, 2017, citi signed an agreement to sell the hilton credit card portfolio (approximately $1.1 billion in outstanding loan balances in citi-branded cards as of december 31, 2017) to american express. in connection with the sale agreement, the existing partnership was extended through the closing date. the sale was completed on january 30, 2018, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $150 million, which approximates one year of revenues from the portfolio. the sale will impact north america gcb's quarterly comparisons in 2018.
as of december 31, 2017, north america gcb's 694 retail bank branches are concentrated in the six key metropolitan areas of new york, chicago, miami, washington, d.c., los angeles and san francisco. also as of december 31, 2017, north america gcb had approximately 9.2 million retail banking customer accounts, $56.0 billion in retail banking loans and $182.5 billion in deposits. in addition, north america gcb had approximately 121 million citi-branded and citi retail services credit card accounts with $139.7 billion in outstanding card loan balances.

net income decreased 37% and was impacted by an estimated $750 million non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of tax reform (for additional information, see "impact of tax reform" above). excluding the impact of tax reform, net income decreased 14% due to higher cost of credit and slightly higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 3%, driven by higher revenues across all businesses.
retail banking revenues increased 1%. excluding the decline in mortgage revenues (down of 32%), retail banking revenues were up 9%, driven by growth in checking deposits, continued growth in loans (average loans up 3%) and assets under management (up 14%) and increased commercial banking activity, as well as a benefit from higher interest rates. the decline in mortgage revenues was driven by lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, reflecting the higher interest rate environment, as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of citi's mortgage servicing rights.
cards revenues increased 3%. in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the costco portfolio (completed june 17, 2016), as well as modest growth in interest-earning balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios and the higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, given the higher interest rates. average loans grew 15% and purchase sales grew 28%. north america gcb expects that additional terms in certain partnership contracts that go into effect in 2018 will negatively impact citi-branded cards revenues going forward.
citi retail services revenues increased 1%, as continued loan growth was partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed renewal and extension of certain partnerships within the portfolio, as well as the absence of gains on sales of two cards portfolios in 2016. average loans grew 4% and purchase sales grew 2%.
expenses increased 1%, driven by the addition of the costco portfolio, higher volume-related expenses and investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. also included in expenses is an $80 million provision for remediation costs related to a credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act (card act) matter (for additional information, see "corporate/other" below and note 27 to the consolidated financial statements).
provisions increased 24% from the prior year, driven by higher net credit losses and a higher net loan loss reserve build.
net credit losses increased 22% to $4.8 billion, largely driven by higher net credit losses in citi-branded cards (up 28% to $2.4 billion) and citi retail services (up 19% to $2.2 billion). the increase in net credit losses primarily reflected volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as well as the impact of acquiring the costco portfolio in citi-branded cards.
the net loan loss reserve build in 2017 was $873 million (compared to a build of $659 million in the prior year), driven by volume growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios, as well as the increase in net flow rates in later delinquency buckets leading to higher inherent credit loss expectations, primarily in citi retail services.
for additional information on north america gcb's retail banking portfolios, including commercial banking, and its citi-branded cards and citi retail services portfolios, see "credit risk-consumer credit" below.
net income decreased by 23% due to significantly higher cost of credit and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
revenues increased 1%, reflecting higher revenues in citi-branded cards, partially offset by lower revenues in retail banking and citi retail services. retail banking revenues decreased 2%. excluding the previously disclosed $110 million gain on sale of branches in texas in the first quarter of 2015, retail banking revenues were largely unchanged, as lower mortgage revenues were offset by continued volume growth, including growth in average loans (9%) and average checking deposits (9%).
cards revenues increased 2%. in citi-branded cards, revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of the costco portfolio as well as volume growth, partially offset by higher investment-related acquisition and rewards costs and the impact of higher promotional balances. citi retail services revenues decreased 1%, as the impact of the renewal and extension of several partnerships within the portfolio as well as the absence of revenues from portfolio exits were partially offset by modest growth in average loans.
expenses increased 7%, primarily due to the costco acquisition, continued investment spending, volume growth, higher repositioning charges and regulatory and compliance costs, partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and lower legal and related costs.
provisions increased 33%, driven by a net loan loss reserve build, compared to a loan loss reserve release in the prior year, and higher net credit losses. the net loan loss reserve build mostly reflected reserve builds in the cards portfolios and was primarily driven by the impact of the acquisition of the costco portfolio, as well as volume growth and seasoning of the portfolios and the absence of nearly $400 million of reserve releases in 2015 as credit normalized. the reserve build was also due to the estimated impact of proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party debt collections.
the increase in net credit losses was driven by increases in cards and retail banking. in retail banking, net credit losses grew 37%, primarily due to an increase related to citi's energy and energy-related exposures within the commercial banking portfolio, which was largely offset by releases of previously established loan loss reserves. in citi-branded cards, net credit losses increased 1%, driven by volume growth, including the impact of costco beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections. in citi retail services, net credit losses increased 6%, primarily due to portfolio growth and seasoning and the impact of the regulatory changes on collections.

net income decreased 5%, primarily driven by higher credit costs and expenses, partially offset by higher revenues.
retail banking revenues increased 8%, reflecting continued growth in volumes, including an increase in average deposits (8%), average loans (6%), reflecting growth across most portfolios, an increase in assets under management (6%), as well as improved deposit spreads, driven by higher interest rates. cards revenues were largely unchanged, as continued improvement in full-rate revolving loans in the second half of 2017 was offset by a higher cost to fund non-revolving loans. purchase sales grew 8% and average card loans grew 5%.
expenses increased 4%, as ongoing investment spending and business growth were partially offset by efficiency savings. citi continues to execute on its investment plans for citibanamex (totaling more than $1 billion through 2020), including initiatives to modernize the branch network, enhance digital capabilities and upgrade core operating platforms.
provisions increased 12%, primarily driven by higher net credit losses (8%) and a $42 million increase in the net loan loss reserve build, largely reflecting volume growth and seasoning. the increase in the loan loss reserve build was also driven by a mexico earthquake-related loan loss reserve build in the third quarter of 2017 (approximately $25 million).

net income increased 15%, reflecting higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.
revenues increased 5%, driven by improvement in cards and wealth management revenues, partially offset by continued lower retail lending revenues.
retail banking revenues increased 3%, primarily due to the continued improvement in wealth management revenues, partially offset by the repositioning of the retail loan portfolio. wealth management revenues increased due to improvement in investor sentiment, stronger equity markets and increases in assets under management (18%) and investment sales (38%). average deposits increased 5%. the increase in revenues was partially offset by the lower retail lending revenues (down 4%), reflecting continued lower average loans (1%) due to the continued optimization of this portfolio away from lower yielding mortgage loans to focus on growing higher-return personal loans.
cards revenues increased 8%, reflecting 5% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales, both of which benefited from the previously disclosed portfolio acquisition in australia in 2017, as well as modest gains in 2017 related to sales of merchant acquiring businesses in certain countries.
expenses increased 2%, resulting from volume growth and ongoing investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions decreased 2%, primarily driven by a decrease in net credit losses.
for additional information on asia gcb's retail banking portfolios, including commercial banking, and its citi-branded cards portfolio, see "credit risk-consumer credit" below.
revenues decreased 1%, reflecting lower retail banking revenues, partially offset by higher cards revenues. retail banking revenues decreased 2%, mainly due to a 5% decrease in wealth management revenues due to lower client activity, modestly lower investment assets under management and a decline in average loans. the decline in revenues was partially offset by growth in deposit volumes and higher insurance revenues. cards revenues increased 1%, driven by continued improvement in yields, modestly abating regulatory headwinds and modest volume growth due to continued stabilizing payment rates.
expenses increased 2%, primarily due to higher repositioning costs, higher regulatory and compliance costs and increased investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions were largely unchanged as lower net loan loss reserve releases were offset by lower net credit losses, primarily in the commercial portfolio.
institutional clients group institutional clients group (icg) includes banking and markets and securities services (for additional information on these businesses, see "citigroup segments" above). icg provides corporate, institutional, public sector and high-net-worth clients around the world with a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including fixed income and equity sales and trading, foreign exchange, prime brokerage, derivative services, equity and fixed income research, corporate lending, investment banking and advisory services, private banking, cash management, trade finance and securities services. icg transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives, including fixed income, foreign currency, equity and commodity products.
icg revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities. icg earns fee income for assisting clients in clearing transactions, providing brokerage and investment banking services and other such activities. revenue generated from these activities is recorded in commissions and fees and investment banking. revenue is also generated from transaction processing and assets under custody and administration. revenue generated from these activities is primarily recorded in administration and other fiduciary fees. in addition, as a market maker, icg facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. these price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in principal transactions (for additional information on principal transactions revenue, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). other primarily includes mark-to-market gains and losses on certain credit derivatives, gains and losses on available-for-sale (afs) securities and other non-recurring gains and losses. interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid to customers on deposits and long- and short-term debt, is recorded as net interest revenue.
the amount and types of markets revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions. assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. however, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. for example, a decrease in market liquidity may increase bid/offer spreads, decrease client activity levels and widen credit spreads on product inventory positions.
icg's management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluating of the above factors at the trading desk as well as the country level. icg does not separately track the impact on total markets revenues of the volume of transactions, bid/offer spreads, fair value changes of product inventory positions and economic hedges because, as noted above, these components are interrelated and are not deemed useful or necessary individually to manage the markets businesses at an aggregate level.
in the markets businesses, client revenues are those revenues directly attributable to client transactions at the time of inception, including commissions, interest or fees earned. client revenues do not include the results of client facilitation activities (for example, holding product inventory in anticipation of client demand) or the results of certain economic hedging activities.
icg's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 98 countries and jurisdictions. at december 31, 2017, icg had approximately $1.3 trillion of assets and $640 billion of deposits, while two of its businesses-securities services and issuer services-managed approximately $17.4 trillion of assets under custody compared to $15.2 trillion at the end of the prior-year period.

(1)   credit derivatives are used to economically hedge a portion of the corporate loan portfolio that includes both accrual loans and loans at fair value. gains (losses) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives and the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. the fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. citigroup's results of operations excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges are non-gaap financial measures.
(2)   excludes cva/dva in 2015, consistent with current presentation. for additional information, see notes 1 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)   2017 includes the $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business. 2016 includes a charge of approximately $180 million, primarily reflecting the write-down of citi's net investment in venezuela as a result of changes in the exchange rate.
(4) excludes principal transactions revenues of icg businesses other than markets, primarily treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
the discussion of the results of operations for icg below excludes the impact of cva/dva for 2015. presentations of the results of operations, excluding the impact of cva/dva and the impact of gains (losses) on hedges of accrual loans, are non-gaap financial measures. for a reconciliation of these metrics to the reported results, see the table above.
net income decreased 5% and was impacted by an estimated $2.0 billion non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of tax reform (for additional information, see "impact of tax reform" above). excluding the impact of tax reform, net income increased 16%, primarily driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher expenses.
•   revenues increased 7%, reflecting a 16% increase in banking (including the losses on loan hedges). excluding the impact of the losses on loan hedges, banking revenues increased 12%, driven by solid growth across all products. markets and securities services were largely unchanged, as growth in securities services revenues (increase of 8%) as well as the $580 million gain on the sale of a fixed income analytics business were offset by a 6% decrease in fixed income markets and a 2% decrease in equity markets revenues.
within banking:
•   investment banking revenues increased 20%, largely reflecting gains in wallet share across products and regions as well as an improvement from the industry-wide slowdown in activity levels during the first half of 2016, particularly in equity underwriting and advisory. advisory revenues increased 11%, driven by north america and emea, reflecting wallet share gains and the increased market activity. equity underwriting revenues increased 68%, driven by strength in north america and emea, due to significant wallet share gains as well as the increase in overall market activity. debt underwriting revenues increased 13%, reflecting strength across regions, primarily driven by wallet share gains.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 7%, reflecting growth across all regions that was balanced across both net interest and fee income. the increase was primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients, continued growth in deposit balances and improved spreads in certain regions. the trade business experienced modest revenue growth, as continued focus on high-quality loan growth was largely offset by industry-wide tightening of spreads. average deposit balances increased 4%, while average trade loans increased 5% (4% excluding the impact of fx translation).
•   corporate lending revenues increased 59%. excluding the impact of losses on loans hedges, revenues increased 12%, driven by lower hedging costs and the absence of a prior-year adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing transaction.
•   private bank revenues increased 14%, reflecting strength across all regions and products. the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher loan and deposit volumes, higher deposit spreads and increased managed investments and capital markets activity.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues decreased 6%, with lower revenues in all regions, primarily due to low volatility as well as the comparison to higher revenues in the prior year from a more robust trading environment following the vote in the u.k. in favor of its withdrawal from the european union, as well as the u.s. election. the decline in revenues was driven by lower net interest revenue (decreased 22%), largely due to higher funding costs and a change in the mix of trading positions in support of client activity. the decline was partially offset by higher principal transactions revenues and commissions and fees revenues.
rates and currencies revenues decreased 5%, driven by lower g10 rates and currencies revenues. despite the challenging trading environment, corporate client revenues in rates and currencies across the global network remained strong. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 6%, due to a difficult trading environment in the current year given low volatility, driving lower credit markets and commodities revenues, particularly in north america, partially offset by higher municipals revenues, as well as higher securitized markets revenues.
•   equity markets revenues decreased 2%. excluding an episodic loss in derivatives of approximately $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to a single client event, revenues increased 2%, as continued growth in prime finance and delta one client balances and higher investor client activity (particularly in emea and asia) were partially offset by lower episodic activity with corporate clients in north america. excluding the episodic loss in derivatives, equity derivatives revenues increased, driven by the stronger investor client activity. cash equities revenues were modestly higher as well, driven by higher revenues in asia, partially offset by lower cash commissions, as clients continued to move toward automated execution platforms across the industry.
•   securities services revenues increased 8%. excluding the impact of the prior year's divestiture of a private equity fund services business, revenues increased 12%, reflecting strength in all regions, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue due to a more favorable rate environment.
expenses increased 3%, as higher compensation, volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings.
provisions improved $501 million, driven by a net loan loss release of $380 million (compared to a net release of $30 million in the prior year) and a 29% decline in net credit
losses. the increase in net loan loss reserve releases was driven by an improvement in the provision for unfunded lending commitments in the corporate loan portfolio, as well as a favorable credit environment, stability in commodity prices and continued improvement in the portfolio. the decline in net credit losses was largely driven by improvement in the energy sector, partially offset by the impact of the single client event in the fourth quarter noted above.
net income increased 5%, primarily driven by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.
•   revenues were largely unchanged, reflecting higher revenues in markets and securities services (increase of 6%), driven by fixed income markets, offset by lower revenues in banking (decrease of 4% including the gains (losses) on loan hedges). excluding the impact of the gains (losses) on loan hedges, banking revenues increased 1%, driven by treasury and trade solutions and the private bank.
within banking:
•   investment banking revenues decreased 6%, largely reflecting the overall industry-wide slowdown in activity levels in equity underwriting and advisory during the first half of 2016. advisory revenues decreased 9%, reflecting strong performance in 2015. equity underwriting revenues decreased 31%, primarily reflecting the lower market activity. debt underwriting revenues increased 5%, primarily due to higher market activity reflecting a favorable interest rate environment.
•   treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 6%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 8%, reflecting growth across most regions. the increase was primarily due to continued growth in transaction volumes and deposit balances and improved spreads in certain regions. trade revenues increased modestly due to loan growth as well as spread improvements. end-of-period deposit balances increased 5% (6% excluding the impact of fx translation), while average trade loans decreased 2% (1% excluding the impact of fx translation).
•   corporate lending revenues decreased 48%. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges, revenues decreased 6%. excluding the impact of gains (losses) on loan hedges and fx translation, revenues decreased 1%, mostly reflecting the adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing transaction, spread compression and higher hedging costs, partially offset by higher average loans.
•   private bank revenues increased 5%, reflecting growth in loan volumes and improved deposit spreads, partially offset by lower capital markets activity and lower managed investments revenues.
within markets and securities services:
•   fixed income markets revenues increased 14%, with higher revenues in all regions, largely driven by both higher principal transactions revenues (up 22%) and other revenues (up 79%). the increase in principal transactions revenues was primarily due to higher rates and currencies revenues and higher spread products revenues. other revenues increased mainly due to foreign currency losses in 2015. rates and currencies revenues grew 22%, primarily due to the more favorable trading environment and higher client revenues following the vote in the u.k. and the u.s. election. spread products and other fixed income revenues decreased 3%, due to lower securitized products revenues, driven by the impact of significantly lower liquidity in the market in the first quarter of 2016.
•   equity markets revenues declined 9%. equity derivatives and prime finance revenues declined 13%, reflecting both a challenging trading environment across all regions driven by lower volatility compared to 2015, and a comparison to a more favorable trading environment in 2015 in asia. the decline in equity markets revenue was also due to lower equity cash commissions driven by a continued shift to electronic trading and passive investing by clients across the industry.
•   securities services revenues increased 2%. excluding the impact of fx translation, revenues increased 5%, driven by emea, primarily reflecting increased client activity, a modest gain on the sale of a private equity fund services business in the first quarter of 2016, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads. the increase in revenues was partially offset by the absence of revenues from divestitures. excluding the impact of fx translation and divestitures, revenues increased 6%.
expenses decreased 1% as a benefit from fx translation and efficiency savings were partially offset by higher compensation expense and higher repositioning charges.
provisions decreased 49%, driven by a net loan loss reserve release of $30 million (compared to a net build of $748 million in the prior year). the significant decline in loan loss reserve builds was related to energy and energy-related exposures and was driven by stabilization of commodities as oil prices continued to recover from lows in early 2016. the decline in cost of credit was partially offset by higher net credit losses of $516 million (compared to $214 million in the prior year) mostly related to the energy and energy-related exposures, with a vast majority offset by the release of previously established loan loss reserves.
corporate/other corporate/other includes certain unallocated costs of global staff functions (including finance, risk, human resources, legal and compliance), other corporate expenses and unallocated global operations and technology expenses, corporate treasury, certain north america and international legacy consumer loan portfolios, other legacy assets and discontinued operations (for additional information on corporate/other, see "citigroup segments" above). at december 31, 2017, corporate/other had $77 billion in assets, a decrease of 25% year-over-year and 23% from september 30, 2017. the decrease in assets included an approximate $20 billion decline in dtas during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the impact of tax reform.

the net loss was $19.7 billion in 2017, compared to net income of $498 million in the prior year, primarily driven by the estimated $19.8 billion non-cash charge recorded in the tax line due to the impact of tax reform (for additional information, see "impact of tax reform" above). excluding the impact of tax reform, net income declined 69% to $153 million, reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.
revenues declined 40%, primarily reflecting the continued wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of gains related to debt buybacks in 2016. revenues included approximately $750 million in gains on asset sales in the first quarter of 2017, which more than offset a roughly $300 million charge related to the exit of citi's u.s. mortgage servicing operations in the quarter.
expenses declined 24%, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses, partially offset by approximately $100 million in episodic expenses primarily related to the exit of the u.s. mortgage servicing operations. also included in expenses is an approximately $255 million provision for remediation costs related to a card act matter (for additional information, see "north america gcb" above and note 27 to the consolidated financial statements). citi believes the aggregate approximately $335 million provision (including the $80 million provision in north america gcb) to be sufficient for citi's planned remediation.
provisions decreased $244 million to a net benefit of $175 million, primarily due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. net credit losses declined 66% to $149 million, primarily reflecting the impact of ongoing divestiture activity and the continued wind-down of the north america mortgage portfolio. the provision for benefits and claims declined by $105 million, primarily due to lower insurance activity. the net reserve release declined by $147 million to $317 million, and reflected the continued wind-down of the legacy north america mortgage portfolio and divestitures.
net income was $498 million, compared to net income of $2.0 billion in 2015, primarily reflecting lower revenues and a higher effective tax rate in 2016 due to the absence of certain tax benefits in 2015.
revenues decreased 52%, primarily driven by the overall wind-down of legacy assets and lower net gains on sales, particularly the sales of onemain financial and the retail banking and credit cards businesses in japan in the fourth quarter of 2015.
expenses decreased 32%, reflecting the sales and run-off of assets, lower legal and related expenses and lower repositioning costs.
provisions decreased 95% due to lower net credit losses and a lower provision for benefits and claims (decrease of 84%) due to lower insurance activity. net credit losses declined 67%, primarily due to the impact of divestitures and continued credit improvements in north america mortgages.
the selling of ppi by financial institutions in the u.k. has been the subject of intense review and focus by u.k. regulators and the u.k. supreme court.
ppi is designed to cover a customer's loan repayments if certain events occur, such as long-term illness or unemployment.  the u.k. financial conduct authority (fca) found certain problems across the industry with how these products were sold, including customers not realizing that the cost of ppi premiums was being added to their loan or ppi being unsuitable for the customer.  redress generally involves the repayment of premiums and the refund of all applicable contractual interest, together with compensatory interest of 8%.
in addition, during the fourth quarter of 2014, the u.k. supreme court issued a ruling in a case (plevin) involving ppi pursuant to which the court ruled, independent of the sale of the ppi contract, that the ppi contract at issue in the case was "unfair" due to the high sales commissions earned and the lack of disclosure to the customer thereof.
in addition, the fca released a policy statement related to ppi that (i) set a deadline of august 29, 2019 by which consumers must file ppi claims, (ii) provides for the launch of fca-led marketing campaigns to inform consumers of this deadline, (iii) set new rules and guidance for the handling of ppi complaints in light of the supreme court's decision on plevin and (iv) requires all firms to contact all previously rejected customers who may be able to complain under the new "plevin" rule (the plevin customer contact exercise). citi completed the plevin customer contact exercise during the fourth quarter of 2017. the fca-led marketing campaigns began in august 2017 and will continue through the august 2019 deadline. the level of ppi claims also continues to be influenced by the solicitation activity of claims management companies (cmcs).
during 2017, citi increased its ppi reserves by approximately $109 million (with $105 million recorded in corporate/other and $4 million recorded in discontinued operations).  the increase for full-year 2017 compared to an increase of $134 million during 2016 and was primarily due to the ongoing level of ppi claims.
citi's year-end 2017 ppi reserve was $213 million, compared to $228 million as of december 31, 2016.
additional reserving actions, if any, in 2018 will largely depend on the level of customer claims in response to the fca-led marketing campaigns and the level of ongoing cmc activity.
off-balance sheet arrangements citigroup enters into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business. citi's involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including without limitation:
•   purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in unconsolidated special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization entities;
•   holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships and equity interests in other unconsolidated special purpose entities;
•   providing guarantees, indemnifications, loan commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties; and
•   entering into operating leases for property and equipment.
citi enters into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes. for example, securitization arrangements offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. securitization arrangements also assist citi and its customers in monetizing their financial assets and securing financing at more favorable rates than citi or the customers could otherwise obtain.
the table below shows where a discussion of citi's various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this form 10-k. in addition, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

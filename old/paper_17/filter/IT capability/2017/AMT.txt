item 1a.   risk factors a significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand.
a significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. factors that may affect such demand include:
•   increased mergers or consolidations that reduce the number of wireless service providers or use of network sharing among governments or wireless service providers;
•   zoning, environmental, health, tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof;
•   the financial condition of wireless service providers;
•   a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services, including due to general economic conditions or disruption in the financial and credit markets;
•   the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure;
•   delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies; and
•   technological changes.
increasing competition within our industry for tenants may materially and adversely affect our revenue.
our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space. pricing competition from peers could materially and adversely affect our lease rates. we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases, or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases, they may be at rates lower than our current rates, resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate. in addition, should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators, our income could be adversely affected.
if our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
significant consolidation among our tenants could reduce demand for our communications infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues. certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks, and these and other tenants could determine not to renew, or attempt to cancel, avoid or limit leases with us or related payments. in the event a tenant terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum,
we may experience increased churn as a result. our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed. in addition, extensive sharing of site infrastructure, roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites, without compensation to us, may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment, or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants' networks may become redundant.
our business is subject to government and tax regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do.
our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations. in certain jurisdictions, these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively, which could require that we modify or dismantle existing towers at significant cost. zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities, which can delay, prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction, modifications, additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands. existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the timing or cost of construction projects associated with our communications sites and new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us, or that prevent such projects in certain locations, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. in certain jurisdictions, there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location, which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes. in addition, in certain jurisdictions, we are required to pay annual license fees, which may be subject to substantial increases by the government, or new fees may be enacted and applied retroactively. governmental licenses may also be subject to periodic renewal. furthermore, the tax laws, regulations and interpretations governing our business in jurisdictions where we operate may change at any time, potentially with retroactive effect. this includes potential or actual changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of tax authorities. in addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as a reit relative to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of trss. these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states. we anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow. accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:
•   uncertain, inconsistent or changing laws, regulations, rulings or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations, fees or other requirements directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions, any of which laws, fees or requirements may be applied retroactively or with significant delay, or failure to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied;
•   expropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture;
•   laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital;
•   changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, including inflation or currency devaluation;
•   changes to zoning regulations or construction laws, which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications sites;
•   actions restricting or revoking our tenants' spectrum licenses or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses;
•   failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act or similar local anti-bribery laws, or the office of foreign assets control requirements;
•   failure to comply with data privacy laws and other protections of health and employee information;
•   material site issues related to security, fuel availability and reliability of electrical grids;
•   loss of key personnel, including expatriates, in markets where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire; and
•   price-setting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure.
we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, including those arising from our operations, investments and financing transactions related to our international business. volatility in foreign currency exchange
rates can also affect our ability to plan, forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts. our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies. we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our non-u.s. dollar operations, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues, operating profits and income.
in addition, as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally, our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent or conflict with ours, be in positions to take action contrary to our interests, policies or objectives, have competing interests in our, or other, markets that could create conflict of interest issues, withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments, any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs, including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture or to execute buyouts of their interests.
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.
a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants. if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under their agreements with us, our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. in the ordinary course of our business, we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases. historically, we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships. however, it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants, a material modification of the terms of those leases, a deterioration in our relationships with those tenants that leads to a failure to obtain new business from them, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged, which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
due to the long-term nature of our tenant leases, we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants. many wireless service providers operate with substantial levels of debt. sometimes our tenants, or their parent companies, face financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy or terminate operations. in our international operations, many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies. these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities.
in addition, many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures, which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets. if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans or face capital constraints, they may reduce their spending, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business. if, as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, one or more of our tenants experiences financial difficulties or files for bankruptcy, it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset, tower asset, network location intangible asset, tenant-related intangible asset or goodwill. the loss of significant tenants, or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk.
as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets, we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives, increased costs, assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions. achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operations, telecommunications infrastructure assets and personnel. integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among other things, portfolios without requisite permits, differing systems, cultural differences, and conflicting policies, procedures and operations. significant acquisition-related integration costs, including certain nonrecurring charges such as costs associated with onboarding employees and visiting and upgrading tower sites, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid. in addition, integration may significantly burden management and internal resources, including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel. if we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described in the preceding risk factor.
as a result of acquisitions, we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill. in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"), we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired. if, as a result of the factors noted above, the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made.
our expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria.
we may experience increased competition for the acquisition of assets or contracts to build new communications sites for tenants, which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites. some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do, while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do. in addition, we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets. higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
new technologies or changes in a tenant's business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.
the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenant's business model could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates. in addition, tenants may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers, as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies. examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies, which could relieve a portion of our tenants' network capacity needs and, as a result, could reduce the demand for tower-based antenna space. additionally, certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants' network investments away from the traditional tower-based networks, which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites. moreover, the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for tower-based broadcast services transmission and reception. further, a tenant may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model, which would result in a decrease in our revenue and operating results. our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technologies or changes in a tenant's business model could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. conversely, we may invest significant capital in technologies and innovation projects that may not provide expected returns or profitability, which could divert management attention and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements.
our leverage and debt service obligations could have significant negative consequences to our business, results of operations or financial condition, including:
•   requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, reit distributions and preferred stock dividends;
•   impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncured;
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources, including with respect to acquiring assets; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.
we may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales or equity issuances, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations. an increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms, rates and conditions or subject us to additional loan covenants. further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.
if we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available, and even if we qualify for taxation as a reit, we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flow.
commencing with the taxable year beginning january 1, 2012, we have operated as a reit for federal income tax purposes.
qualification for taxation as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"), which provisions may change from time to time, to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. further, tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified. there are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code.
if, in any taxable year, we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code:
•   we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;
•   we will be disqualified from reit tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified.
on december 22, 2017, legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") was signed into law. the tax act makes significant changes to the code, including a number of provisions that affect the taxation of reits, of global corporations and of their stockholders. among the changes made by the tax act are substantial changes to the taxation of international income. we believe that certain consequences of some of these changes to reits with global operations were unintended. nevertheless, absent legislative or administrative relief with respect to these consequences, we will recognize income on account of the activities of our foreign trss that will not be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the reit gross income tests that we are required to satisfy, or we may be subject to additional income tax or operational costs as a result thereof.
we are subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. while state and local income tax regimes often parallel the u.s. federal income tax regime for reits, many of these jurisdictions do not completely follow u.s. federal rules and some may not follow them at all.  for example, some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a reit's deduction for dividends paid, which could increase our income tax expense. we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.
our domestic trs assets and operations are subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporation income taxes. our foreign operations, whether in the reit or trss, are subject to foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located.
any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment, operations and distribution would be reduced.
furthermore, we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interests in subsidiary reits. when we own interests in a subsidiary reit, we must demonstrate that such subsidiary reit complies with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy, together with all other rules applicable to reits. if the subsidiary reit is determined to have failed to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply, then the subsidiary reit would be subject to federal income tax, which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalties and interest. in addition, our ownership of
shares in such subsidiary reit would fail to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75% gross income test. these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a reit.
complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.
our use of trss enables us to engage in non-reit qualifying business activities. under the code, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other non-qualifying assets. this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy.
specifically, this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or services segment as currently structured and operated, in other non-reit qualifying operations or assets, or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure. further, acquisition opportunities in the united states and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closing.
further, as a reit, we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of the reit taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). to meet our annual distribution requirements, we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations, including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt. as no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other non-qualifying types of income, our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments.
in addition, the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations. in many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements.
restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions, our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility, and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock, which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit.
the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. among other things, the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us. if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans, the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets, in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets. we enter into hedges for certain debt instruments. these hedges may have an adverse impact on our results to the extent that the counterparties do not perform as expected at the inception of each hedge.
the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders, including our required reit distributions, and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. additionally, our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness. these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions, or other opportunities. further, reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above, please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources-factors affecting sources of liquidity" and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
our towers, data centers or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage.
our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters, including those that may be related to climate change, such as hurricanes, ice and wind storms, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and wild fires, as well as other unforeseen events, such as acts of terrorism. any damage or destruction to, or inability to access, our towers or data centers may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
as part of our normal business activities, we rely on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational, reporting and compliance activities and to maintain our business records. our computer systems or network operation centers, or those of our cloud or internet-based providers, could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including through cyber attack and data theft), usage errors, catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control. although we and our vendors have disaster recovery programs and security measures in place, if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged, or breached, or otherwise cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information (including information about our tenants or landlords), which could damage our reputation and require us to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues.
while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters, business interruption and cybersecurity, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites for a major future event, lost revenue, including from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event, or other costs to remediate the impact of a significant event. further, we may be liable for damage caused by towers that collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies, which could harm our reputation and require us to incur costs for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.
our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions, especially if these perceived risks are substantiated.
public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow our growth. in particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites. if a scientific study, court decision or government agency ruling resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters.
we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws.
our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes. as the owner, lessee or operator of real property and facilities, including generators, we may be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials, and for damages and costs relating to off-site migration of hazardous materials, without regard to whether we, as the owner, lessee or operator, knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. we may also be liable for certain costs of remediating contamination at third-party sites to which we sent waste for disposal, even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time. many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements. we may not be at all times in compliance with all environmental requirements. we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements.
the requirements of the environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied retroactively, or be broadened to cover situations or persons not currently considered. it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. while we maintain environmental and workers' compensation insurance, we may not have adequate insurance to cover all costs, fines or penalties.
if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.
our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate
that tower site and generate revenues. for various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to long-term operating leases. further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states. our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of the lease period. we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase the towers at the end of the applicable period, or we may choose, for business or other reasons, not to do so. if we do not exercise these purchase rights, and are unable to extend the lease or sublease or otherwise acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period, we will lose the cash flows derived from the towers. if we decide to exercise these purchase rights, the benefits of acquiring a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition, compliance and integration costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption "critical accounting policies and estimates" below.
we report our results in five segments: u.s. property, asia property, emea property, latin america property and services. in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report).
executive overview we are one of the largest global reits and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. we refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 99% of our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 and includes our u.s. property segment, asia property segment, emea property segment and latin america property segment.
we also offer tower-related services in the united states, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites.
the following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of december 31, 2017:
number ofowned towers       number ofoperated towers (1)                  number of owned das sites domestic:
united states                 24,231                    16,009                                    378
(1)   approximately 98% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options.
(3)   in argentina, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, fiber and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation.
(4)   in mexico, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, concrete poles and other infrastructure.
in most of our markets, our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial non-cancellable term of at least ten years, with multiple renewal terms. accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31, 2017 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31, 2017, we expect to generate over $32 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the united states) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. in addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs.
the revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. as discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.
revenue lost from either cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our property operations. this was again the case during the year ended december 31, 2017, in which loss of tenant billings from tenant lease cancellations, non-renewal or renegotiations represented approximately 2% of our tenant billings. we do anticipate an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals in 2018 primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in asia, which is likely to result in a modestly higher impact on our revenues, including tenant billings, as compared to the historical average.
property operations revenue growth. due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. in many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expenditures.
the primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:
•   new revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period;
•   new revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites ("colocations") and lease amendments; and
•   revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases ("pass-through"), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.
we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites' utilization and profitability. we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. in addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives.
property operations organic revenue growth. consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. this rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions.
based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:
•   in less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. we have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.
•   subscribers' use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. we believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.
•   the deployment of advanced mobile technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. as a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.
•   wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. we anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage.
•   wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum.
•   next generation technologies centered on wireless connections have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. these technologies may include autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or iot, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services.
as part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. in addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as bharti airtel limited, telefónica s.a. and vodafone group plc, among others. we believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.
in emerging markets, such as ghana, india, nigeria and uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas. a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low. in more developed urban locations within these markets, data network deployments are underway. carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate.
in india, the ongoing transition from 2g technology to 4g technology has included and is expected to continue to include a period of carrier consolidation over the next several years, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace will be reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace. over the long term, this consolidation process is expected to result in a more favorable structural environment for both the wireless carriers as well as communications infrastructure providers. in the shorter term, the consolidation process has resulted and is likely to further result in elevated levels of churn within our india business, as certain components of the combined carrier networks and carrier exits are decommissioned to allow for a more robust 4g deployment in the future.
in markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on 3g and 4g network build outs. consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, and, as a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service.
finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as germany and france, carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity.
we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets. as a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 109,565 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long-term growth.
we have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn. certain of those master lease agreements are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.
property operations new site revenue growth. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 6,885 sites globally, as well as the acquisition of certain urban telecommunications assets in mexico. in a majority of our asia, emea and latin america markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications
real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio.
new sites (acquired or constructed)         2017             2016   2015
property operations expenses. direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. in general, our property segments' selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. as a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow. we may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.
services segment revenue growth. as we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues.
non-gaap financial measures included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted ("adjusted ebitda"), funds from operations, as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit ffo") attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders, consolidated adjusted funds from operations ("consolidated affo") and affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders.
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income (loss) from equity method investments; income tax benefit (provision); other income (expense); gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; interest expense; interest income; other operating income (expense); depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense.
nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. in this section, we refer to nareit ffo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as "nareit ffo (common stockholders)."
we define consolidated affo as nareit ffo (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures.
we define affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders for the year ended december 31, 2017 as consolidated affo, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both nareit ffo (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of consolidated affo. in this section, we refer to affo attributable to american tower corporation common stockholders as "affo (common stockholders)."
adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo (common stockholders), consolidated affo and affo (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap. none of adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo (common stockholders), consolidated affo or affo (common stockholders) represents cash flows
from operating activities in accordance with gaap and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. rather, adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo (common stockholders), consolidated affo and affo (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments' performance; (2) adjusted ebitda is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) adjusted ebitda is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) consolidated affo is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust nareit ffo (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in nareit ffo (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry.
our measurement of adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo (common stockholders), consolidated affo and affo (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. reconciliations of adjusted ebitda, nareit ffo (common stockholders), consolidated affo and affo (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable gaap measure, have been included below.

we use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations and tower and land acquisitions. additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our reit taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit under the code. we may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. we typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions.

the term loan, the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. we have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the london interbank offered rate ("libor") as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the term loan, the 2013 credit facility and the 2014 credit facility. the interest rate on the 2013 credit facility ranges between 0.875% to 1.750% above libor for libor based borrowings or up to 0.750% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. the current margin over libor and the base rate for the 2013 credit facility is 1.125% and 0.125%, respectively. the interest rates on the term loan and the 2014 credit facility range between 1.000% to 2.000% above libor for libor based borrowings or up to 1.000% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. the current margin over libor and the base rate for each of the term loan and the 2014 credit facility is 1.250% and 0.250%, respectively.

we expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining $344.8 million under the 2011 buyback and the $2.0 billion authorized under the 2017 buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. we expect to fund further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. purchases under the 2011 buyback and the 2017 buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases.
sales of equity securities. we receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the "espp") and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we received an aggregate of $119.7 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the espp.
distributions. as a reit, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our reit taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of nols. we have distributed an aggregate of approximately $4.3 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in january 2018, primarily classified as ordinary income.
the amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize nols to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.
we had two series of preferred stock, the series a preferred stock, with a dividend rate of 5.25%, and the series b preferred stock, with a dividend rate of 5.50%. dividends were payable quarterly in arrears, subject to declaration by our board of directors. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we paid dividends of $2.625 per share, or $15.8 million, to series a
preferred stockholders of record and $55.00 per share, or $75.6 million, to series b preferred stockholders of record. during the year ended december 31, 2017, all outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock converted at a rate of 0.9337 per share into an aggregate of 5,602,153 shares of our common stock pursuant to the provisions of the certificate of designations governing the series a preferred stock.
in addition, on february 15, 2018, we paid dividends of $13.75 per share, or $18.9 million, to series b preferred stockholders of record at the close of business on february 1, 2018. on february 15, 2018, all outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock converted at a rate of 8.7420 per share of series b preferred stock, or 0.8742 per depositary share, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of series b preferred stock, into shares of our common stock pursuant to the provisions of the certificate of designations governing the series b preferred stock. as a result of the conversions of the series b preferred stock in 2018, we issued an aggregate of 12,020,064 shares of our common stock.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we paid $2.50 per share, or $1.1 billion, to common stockholders of record. in addition, we declared a distribution of $0.70 per share, or $300.2 million, paid on january 16, 2018 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on december 28, 2017.
we accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. as of december 31, 2017, the amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $10.1 million. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we paid $3.0 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units.
for more details on the cash distributions paid to our common and preferred stockholders during the year ended december 31, 2017, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.

(9)   includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases.
(10)   primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other non-current liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash.
(11)   excludes $94.8 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $29.0 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. however, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.
off-balance sheet arrangements. we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.
factors affecting sources of liquidity our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor's understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.
internally generated funds. because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2017 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. in addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites.
restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities. the loan agreements for the 2013 credit facility, the 2014 credit facility and the term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. these restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. in the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) of at least 2.50:1.00. as of december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.

(2)    assumes no change to adjusted ebitda.
(3)    assumes no change to our debt levels.
(4)    effectively, however, additional senior secured debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the consolidated total leverage ratio.
the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.
failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. if this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.
restrictions under agreements relating to the 2015 securitization and the 2013 securitization. the indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the american tower secured revenue notes, series 2015-1, class a (the "series 2015-1 notes") and the american tower secured revenue notes, series 2015-2, class a (the "series 2015-2 notes," and, together with the series 2015-1 notes, the "2015 notes") issued by gtp acquisition partners i, llc ("gtp acquisition partners") in the 2015 securitization and the loan agreement related to the 2013 securitization include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. among other things, american tower asset sub, llc and american tower asset sub ii, llc (together, the "amt asset subs") and gtp acquisition partners are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement).
under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the secured tower revenue securities, series 2013-1a and series 2013-2a issued in the 2013 securitization (the "loan"), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. on a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. as of december 31, 2017, $107.3 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash.
certain information with respect to the 2015 securitization and the 2013 securitization is set forth below. the debt service coverage ratio ("dscr") is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 notes or the loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.

(2)   once triggered, a cash trap dscr condition continues to exist until the dscr exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters. during a cash trap dscr condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the "cash trap reserve account") instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower.
(3)   an amortization period commences if the dscr is equal to or below 1.15x (the "minimum dscr") at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters.
(4)   no amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. however, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.
a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, meet reit distribution requirements and make preferred stock dividend payments. during an "amortization period," all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable cash trap reserve account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 notes or the loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 notes or subclass of loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. with respect to the 2015 notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 notes, declare such series of 2015 notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. furthermore, if gtp acquisition partners or the amt asset subs were to default on a series of the 2015 notes or the loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 2015 secured sites or the 2013 secured towers, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.
as discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our reit distribution requirements and debt service obligations, pay preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness.
in addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption "risk factors," we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31, 2017. we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. in many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap, with no need for management's judgment in its application. there are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.
•   impairment of assets-assets subject to depreciation and amortization: we review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable.
we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.
we review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows.
if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.
in october 2017, one of our tenants in asia, tata teleservices, informed the department of telecommunications in india of its intent to exit the wireless telecommunications business and announced plans to transfer its business to another telecommunications provider.
we considered these recent developments regarding these events when conducting our annual impairment test for the tata teleservices tenant relationship, which did not result in an impairment since the estimated probability-weighted undiscounted cash flows were in excess of the carrying value of this asset by approximately $33.5 million, or 7%.
key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows were future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies, operating margins and the probability weightings assigned to the future cash flow scenarios. for this tenant relationship intangible asset, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a 7% reduction on projected cash flows, which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the tenant relationship exceeds its carrying value.
we will continue to monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tata teleservices could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangibles, which have a current net book value of $436.4 million.
•   impairment of assets-goodwill: we review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of december 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. we utilize the two step impairment test and employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management's expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit's goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, no potential impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. the fair value of our india reporting unit, which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows (the income approach) exceeded the carrying value by approximately $99.1 million, or 3%. as a result of the telecommunications carrier consolidation occurring in the india market, we lowered our discounted cash flow projections, which increases the sensitivity of these projections to changes in the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the india reporting unit as of december 31, 2017. key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate and the weighted-average cost of capital, which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions related to the impacts of the carrier consolidation.
for this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that (i) a 6% reduction on projected revenues, (ii) a 21 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital or (iii) a 10% reduction in terminal sales growth rate, individually, each of which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the india reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. events that could negatively affect our india reporting units financial results include increased customer attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation, carrier tenant bankruptcies, and other factors set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption "risk factors."
the carrying value of goodwill in the india reporting unit was $1,095.0 million as of december 31, 2017, which represents 19% of our consolidated balance of $5,638.4 million.
•   asset retirement obligations: when required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation's estimated settlement date.
we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $68.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2017. the change in 2017 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. while we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.
•   acquisitions: we evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. for those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. we continue to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition.
•   revenue recognition: our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured. escalation clauses tied to the consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. total property straight-line revenues for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $194.4 million, $131.7 million and $155.0 million, respectively. amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.
we derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 53% of our revenues derived from four tenants. in addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and
tenants. in recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. to the extent the amounts, based on management's estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant's inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.
•   rent expense: many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. in addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. we calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured.
•   income taxes: accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable income.
we periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets' recoverability.
we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management's judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.
the tax act significantly changes how the u.s. taxes corporations. the tax act contains several key provisions including, among other things, a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of all post-1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits, a reduction in the corporate income rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017 and the introduction of a new u.s. tax on certain off-shore earnings referred to as global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti").
the sec staff issued guidance to address the application of gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act and allows the registrant to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. we have recognized the provisional impacts of the tax act in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017. we estimated these amounts to not be material, however, our estimates are provisional and subject to further analysis.
the financial accounting standards board also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of gilti, noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. we have not completed our analysis of the effects of the gilti provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the permitted measurement period.

item 1a. risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements the information in this report includes forward-looking statements about future events and circumstances and their effects upon revenues, expenses and business opportunities. generally speaking, any statement in this report not based upon historical fact is a forward-looking statement. forward-looking statements can also be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate" and "plan" or similar expressions. in particular, statements regarding our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding our business and industry, including those under "outlook", are forward-looking statements. they reflect our expectations, are not guarantees of performance and speak only as of the date of this report. except as required by law, we do not undertake to update them. our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change or not be realized, and you should not rely unduly on forward-looking statements. our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are reflected in the following considerations and factors, as well as elsewhere in our filings with the sec. if any of these considerations or risks materialize, our expectations may change and our performance may be adversely affected.
if we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to increase operating income.
to drive future results, our business strategies must be effective in delivering increased guest counts to drive operating income growth. whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our system's ability to:
•   continue to innovate and differentiate the mcdonald's experience by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;
•   capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to enhance our ability to retain, regain and convert key customer groups;
•   utilize our more adaptive organizational structure to execute against our initiatives at an accelerated pace;
•   strengthen customer appeal and augment our digital initiatives, including mobile ordering and delivery, along with experience of the future ("eotf"), particularly in the u.s.;
•   identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of systemwide restaurants; and
•   operate restaurants with high service levels and optimal capacity while managing the increasing complexity of our restaurant operations.
if we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected returns.
we will continue to build upon our investments in eotf, which focus on restaurant modernization and technology and digital engagement in order to transform the restaurant experience. as we accelerate our pace of converting restaurants to eotf, we are placing renewed emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, as well as mobile ordering and payment systems. we also continue to build on delivery initiatives, which may not generate expected returns. we may not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, or these initiatives may not be well executed, and therefore our business results may suffer.
if we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences, our business could suffer.
our continued success depends on our system's ability to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics, and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings and consumer preferences in the "informal eating out" ieo segment. in order to deliver a relevant experience for our customers amidst a highly competitive, value-driven operating environment, we must implement initiatives to adapt at an aggressive pace. there is no assurance mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report that these initiatives will be successful and, if they are not, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
activities relating to our refranchising and cost savings initiatives remain ongoing and entail various risks.
our previously announced refranchising and cost saving initiatives remain ongoing. as we continue on those initiatives, the existing risks we face in our business may be intensified. our efforts to reduce costs and capital expenditures depend, in part, upon our refranchising efforts, which, in turn, depend upon our selection and integration of capable third parties. our cost savings initiatives also depend upon a variety of factors, including our ability to achieve efficiencies through the consolidation of global, back-office functions. if these various initiatives are not successful, take longer to complete than initially projected, or are not well executed, or if our cost reduction efforts adversely impact our effectiveness, our business operations, financial results and results of operations could be adversely affected.
if pricing, promotional and marketing plans are not effective, our results may be negatively impacted.
our results depend on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the system, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. existing or future pricing strategies, and the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy; however, they may not be successful and could negatively impact sales and margins. further, the promotion of menu offerings may yield results below the desired levels.
additionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful, and we may fail to attract and retain customers. our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels allows us to reach our customers effectively. if the advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.
failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
to be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand. brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions. those perceptions are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, our business practices and the manner in which we source the commodities we use. consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. for example, nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the ieo segment or perceptions of our brand generally or relative to available alternatives. consumer perceptions may also be affected by third parties presenting or promoting adverse commentary or portrayals of the quick-service category of the ieo segment, our brand and/or our operations, our suppliers or our franchisees. if we are unsuccessful in addressing such adverse commentary or portrayals, our brand and our financial results may suffer.
additionally, the ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our sustainability initiatives, which require system-wide coordination and alignment. if we are not effective in addressing social responsibility matters or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. in particular, business incidents or practices that erode consumer trust or confidence, particularly if such incidents or practices receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.
we face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.
we compete primarily in the ieo segment, which is highly competitive. we also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores and coffee shops. we expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by new or continuing actions of our competitors, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.
we compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. in particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, develop new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or disruptive actions from others which we do not foresee. recognizing these dependencies, we have intensified our focus in recent periods on strategies to achieve these goals, and we will likely continue to modify our strategies and implement new strategies in the future. there can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics.
unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.
our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity, stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. continued adverse economic conditions or adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance, and our business and financial results may suffer.
our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.
supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.
we depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient product supply, including on favorable terms. although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. supply chain interruptions, including shortages and transportation issues, and price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. such shortages or disruptions could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers, mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report franchisees or us. if we experience interruptions in our system's supply chain, our costs could increase and it could limit the availability of products critical to our system's operations.
food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.
our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our system's ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on mcdonald's of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future. food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. however, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenues and profits.
our franchise business model presents a number of risks.
our success increasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates, yet we have limited influence over their operations. our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from company-operated restaurants. our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. the revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. if our franchisees do not experience sales growth, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures, or delayed or reduced payments to us. our refranchising efforts will continue to increase that dependence and the potential effect of those factors.
our success also increasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. franchisees' ability to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or by the creditworthiness of our franchisees or the company. our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.
our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. the decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex and changing. our ability to achieve the benefits of our refranchising strategy, which involves a significant percentage of franchised restaurants, including an increased number of restaurants run by developmental licensees and affiliates, depends on various factors. those factors include whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.
challenges with respect to talent management could harm our business.
effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. failure to effectively identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.
our success depends in part on our system's ability to recruit, motivate and retain a qualified workforce to work in our restaurants in an intensely competitive environment. increased costs associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees to work in our company-operated restaurants could have a negative impact on our company-operated margins. similar concerns apply to our franchisees.
we are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with u.s. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our company-operated restaurants. these regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers (or perceptions thereof) could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit and retain talent) or the franchisees and suppliers that are also part of the mcdonald's system and whose performance may have a material impact on our results.
information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may interrupt our operations.
we are increasingly reliant on technological systems, such as point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms, technologies supporting mcdonald's delivery and digital solutions, as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally, with affiliated entities, customers or independent third parties to conduct our business, including technology-enabled systems provided to us by third parties. any failure of these systems could significantly impact our operations and customer experience and perceptions.
despite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems and solutions could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. our increasing reliance on third party systems also present the risks faced by the third party's business, including the operational, security and credit risks of those parties. if those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in our operations.
furthermore, security breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with (including franchisees), or those of third party providers. these may include such things as unauthorized access, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. our information technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers, mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report our employees and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. an actual or alleged security breach could result in disruptions, shutdowns, theft or unauthorized disclosure of personal, financial, proprietary or other confidential information. the occurrence of any of these incidents could result in reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and criminal penalties or civil liabilities.
the global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.
we encounter differing cultural, regulatory and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where mcdonald's restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the system's success in these environments. meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our system's ability to leverage operating successes across markets. planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with mcdonald's customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.
disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees' or our suppliers' operations, and asset seizures. the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigations or inquiries, whether or not they have merit, may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental investigations or inquiries.
additionally, challenges and uncertainties are associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. such challenges may be exacerbated in many cases by a lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainties in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. an inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
we may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. for example, as a result of the u.k.'s decision to leave the european union through a negotiated exit over a period of time, including its recent formal commencement of exit proceedings, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, as well as potential referenda in the u.k. and/or other european countries, that could cause uncertainty in european or worldwide economic conditions. in the short term, the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates, and the resulting depression in those exchange rates may continue. any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. in particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations, including changes and uncertainties resulting from proposals for comprehensive or corporate tax reforms in the u.s. or elsewhere. on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act") was signed into law. while we have estimated the effects of the tax act, we continue to refine those estimates with the possibility they could change, and those changes could be material. we are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing authorities inside and outside of the u.s. in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. any increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
the profitability of our company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supplies, fuel, utilities and distribution, and other operating costs, including labor. any volatility in certain commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. the commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef and chicken, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
increasing regulatory complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results.
our regulatory environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. in many of our markets, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. we are affected by the cost, compliance and other risks associated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations we face, including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.
our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans and operations. these regulations include product packaging, marketing, the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers (particularly given varying requirements and practices for testing and disclosure).
additionally, we are working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources. these risks include the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. these risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report establish additional goals and take actions to meet them. these risks could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. if we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
we are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us.
increasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. we could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former franchisees and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party's trademarks, copyrights or patents).
inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to regulatory proceedings or litigation.
litigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. we are also subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability, such as in the areas of privacy and data collection, protection and management, as it relates to information we collect and share when we provide optional technology-related services and platforms to third parties.
•   the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings;
•   the cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products;
•   adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices; and
a judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business.
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the mcdonald's brand and our business.
the success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. we rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.
we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. the trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the u.s. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the u.s. and foreign countries may not be adequate. in addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. in particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.
we cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.
changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results.
new accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. we may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings. in assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. these estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends, and our restructuring activities. if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. if we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.
a decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability.
our credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. as a result, our interest expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants.
our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. if any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report trading volatility and price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.
many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. the most important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following:
•   the unpredictable nature of global economic and market conditions;
•   governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the u.s., which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;
•   trading activity in our common stock or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which mcdonald's may be included, such as the s&amp;p 500 index and the dow jones industrial average;
•   the impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as those we may take from time to time as we implement our strategies in light of changing business, legal and tax considerations and evolve our corporate structure.
events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects.
severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, terrorist activities, health epidemics or pandemics (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview description of the business the company franchises and operates mcdonald's restaurants. of the 37,241 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2017, 34,108 were franchised (reflects 21,366 franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,945 licensed to developmental licensees and 5,797 licensed to foreign affiliates ("affiliates")-primarily in japan and china) and 3,133 were operated by the company.
under mcdonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. the company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. this maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. in certain circumstances, the company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives.
under mcdonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the company generally has no capital invested. in addition, the company has an equity investment in a number of affiliates (primarily in japan and china) that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.
mcdonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of mcdonald's. however, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides company personnel with restaurant operations experience. in company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, mcdonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. mcdonald's continually reviews its mix of company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term.
the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. fees vary by type of site, amount of company investment, if any, and local business conditions. these fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.
the business is structured into the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth, and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance:
•   international lead markets - established markets including australia, canada, france, germany, the u.k. and related markets.
•   high growth markets - markets that the company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including china, italy, korea, the netherlands, poland, russia, spain, switzerland and related markets.
•   foundational markets &amp; corporate - the remaining markets in the mcdonald's system, most of which operate under a largely franchised model. corporate activities are also reported within this segment.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets accounted for 35%, 32% and 24% of total revenues, respectively.
in analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-gaap, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital ("roiic"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below.
•   constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the company believes this better represents its underlying business trends.
•   comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the company's initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation, and, beginning in 2017, also exclude sales from venezuela due to its hyper-inflation. management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. the goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check.
•   systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. while franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.
•   roiic is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. the return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. the calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.
•   free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the company's ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.
strategic direction and financial performance the strength of the alignment among the company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the "system") is key to mcdonald's long-term success. by leveraging the system, mcdonald's is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. mcdonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of system alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities.
customer-centric growth strategy beginning in 2015, the company made purposeful changes to execute against key elements of its turnaround plan including a renewed focus on running better restaurants, driving operational growth, returning excitement to the brand and enhancing financial value. the company's current momentum is broad-based throughout the system and its recent performance demonstrates that mcdonald's has completed the transition from turnaround to growth.
in 2017, the company shifted its focus to delivering long-term growth through accelerated execution of its customer-centric strategy - the velocity growth plan. this plan outlines actions to drive sustainable guest count growth, a reliable long-term measure of the company's strength, that is vital to growing sales and shareholder value.
the velocity growth plan is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, along with a deep understanding of the key drivers of the business. the company is targeting the tremendous opportunity at the core of its business - its food, value and customer experience. the strategy is built on the following three pillars, all focusing on building a better mcdonald's:
•   retaining existing customers - focusing on areas where it already has a strong foothold in the ieo category, including family occasions and food-led breakfast.
•   regaining lost customers - recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely food taste and quality, convenience and value.
•   converting casual to committed customers - building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the mccafé coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings.
in each pillar, mcdonald's has established sustainable platforms that enable execution of the plan with greater speed, efficiency and impact while remaining relentlessly focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. additionally, through three identified growth accelerators - experience of the future ("eotf"), digital and delivery - mcdonald's is enhancing the overall customer experience with hospitable, friendly service and ever-improving convenience for customers on their terms. the company met aggressive deployment targets for each one of these accelerators in 2017 and continues further implementation in 2018 and beyond.
•   experience of the future. the company continues to build upon its investments in eotf, focusing on restaurant modernization and technology, in order to transform the restaurant service experience and enhance the brand in the eyes of the customer. the modernization efforts are designed to drive incremental customer visits and higher average check. mcdonald's currently has eotf deployed in about one-third of the restaurants globally, with half of the u.s. restaurants expected to be deployed by the end of 2018.
•   digital. as the company accelerates its pace of converting restaurants to eotf, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. by evolving the technology platform, the company is expanding choices for how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks and technology-driven models that enable table service and curb-side pick-up. in the u.s. alone, mcdonald's now has over 20 million registered users of the mcdonald's application.
•   delivery. the company continues to further scale its delivery platform as a way of expanding the convenience customers receive from mcdonald's. in 2017, mcdonald's added delivery to 7,000 restaurants in 21 different countries. including previously offering delivery in asia and the middle east, mcdonald's is now delivering meals from over 10,000 restaurants. in addition to added convenience, delivery transactions tend to realize a higher average check and a high customer satisfaction rating. in 2018, while the company expects to continue to expand the number of restaurants offering delivery, the focus will shift to growing awareness and demand in the areas where delivery is already offered.
in 2018, mcdonald's has plans to raise consumer awareness of the enhanced convenience available with delivery and mobile order and pay through thoughtful marketing campaigns that aim to increase the number of customers enjoying these expanded options to engage with the brand. the company is optimistic that this will contribute to the continued momentum of the business.
in addition to the customer-relevant changes in the restaurants, the company has enhanced financial value through its refranchising efforts, g&a cost savings initiatives and cash return to shareholders. in 2017, the company achieved its target to refranchise 4,000 restaurants, a full year ahead of the original target date. mcdonald's is currently 92% franchised, with a long-term goal of approximately 95%. the transition to a more heavily franchised business model is benefiting the company's performance, as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees provides a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks. this includes a less g&a and capital intensive structure as franchisees are responsible for supporting and reinvesting in their businesses. under this more heavily franchised structure, growing comparable sales will be the strongest driver of operating income growth and returns.
through execution of the velocity growth plan, mcdonald's is serving more customers more often. in 2018, the company remains aggressively focused on executing its ambitious plan to unlock more of its potential and drive long-term sustainable growth.
mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report our velocity growth plan also includes the company doing its part to further embed certain social and environmental issues into the core of our business, which we refer to as our scale for good.  as one of the world's largest restaurant companies, our scale for good highlights our commitment to global priorities that are consistent with our strategic priorities and provides an opportunity to collaborate with our franchisees and suppliers to drive meaningful progress.  we believe it is important for customers to feel good about visiting mcdonald's restaurants and eating our food in order to continue to drive each of the pillars within our strategy.
while we're committed to addressing many challenges facing society today, we're elevating a few global priorities that reflect analysis of major social and environmental impacts of our food and our business and the material environmental and social issues that matter most to our customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers and stakeholders. our four global priorities are: beef sustainability, packaging and recycling, commitment to families and our investment in people.  beyond these global priorities, we will continue to drive progress on our goals and commitments across key social and environmental topics such as climate change, diversity, animal health and welfare, and supporting families and farmers.
2017 financial performance the company's 2017 financial performance demonstrates that the velocity growth plan is working. by focusing on the aforementioned three pillars, and the identified growth accelerators, the company achieved its best comparable sales performance in six years. in 2017, global comparable sales increased 5.3% and global comparable guest counts increased 1.9%, with positive results achieved in all segments.
•   comparable sales in the u.s. increased 3.6% and comparable guest counts increased 1.0%. the growth in comparable sales and guest counts was supported by the full breadth of our menu, including national beverage value offerings, strong performance of core menu items featured under the mcpick 2 platform as well as signature crafted premium sandwiches and other menu innovations.
•   comparable sales in the international lead segment increased 5.3% and comparable guest counts increased 2.3%, reflecting positive performance across all of the segment, led by the u.k. and canada.
•   in the high growth segment, comparable sales increased 5.3% and comparable guest counts increased 1.8%. this performance reflects positive results across most of the segment, led by china.
•   comparable sales in the foundational markets increased 9.0% and comparable guest counts increased 3.3%, led by strong performance in japan and latin america, as well as solid results across the remainder of the segment.
in addition to improved comparable sales and guest count performance, the company achieved the following financial results in 2017:
•   consolidated revenues decreased 7% (8% in constant currencies) as positive comparable sales were more than offset by the impact of refranchising.
•   consolidated operating income increased 23% (23% in constant currencies), which benefited from a gain on the sale of the company's businesses in china and hong kong.
•   capital expenditures of $1.9 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings.
•   across the system, about 900 restaurants (including those in our developmental licensee and affiliated markets) were opened.
•   free cash flow was $3.7 billion (see reconciliation in exhibit 12).
•   one-year roiic was 1,671.8% and three-year roiic was 93.1% for the period ended december 31, 2017. excluding the gain from the sale of businesses in china and hong kong, as well as significant investing cash inflows from strategic refranchising initiatives, one year and three year roiic were 48.3% and 43.6%, respectively (see reconciliation in exhibit 12).
•   the company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 7% to $1.01 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $4.04 per share.
•   the company returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the year.
mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report areas of focus by segment u.s.
the u.s. remains diligent in driving guest count growth momentum in 2018 by continuing to focus on actions that collectively transform the customer experience.
with the launch of the $1 $2 $3 dollar menu in january 2018, the company is offering a compelling, national value program that resonates with customers. additionally, an emphasis on food taste and quality will remain a key priority. in 2018, the u.s. is planning to introduce fresh beef across the majority of its restaurants, cooked right when ordered and served hot off the grill for all quarter pounder burgers. the u.s. will also offer new seasonal flavors to further expand the mccafé espresso line in 2018, following its successful relaunch of mccafé in 2017.
the pace of activity in the u.s. remains accelerated with a focus on increasing customer awareness of its global mobile application, mobile order and pay functionality as well as its delivery platform. further, the company is accelerating its investment in eotf as it expects to complete nearly 4,000 u.s. restaurants in 2018. a majority of traditional restaurants in the u.s. are expected to be substantially complete with eotf by the end of 2019, offering a holistic, modern experience for customers.
international lead markets international lead markets continue to deepen their connection with customers and meet their changing needs with meaningful enhancements in menu, accessibility and experience.
the segment is focused on providing quality, great taste, value and choice across the entire menu. programs across the segment are energizing the core menu, and every market has successfully extended into premium chicken and beef, in addition to locally relevant offerings. all of this is supported by modernized cooking and service platforms that expand capacity and enable hotter, fresher products. entry-level value programs appeal to teens and young adults, while other platforms provide budget-conscious customers affordable meal bundles.
international lead markets remain focused on enhancing and expanding the mccafé coffee brand and the ongoing deployment of eotf restaurants across the segment. in addition to eotf, the continued roll out of delivery provides customers with the high levels of convenience they are seeking.
high growth markets mcdonald's high growth markets have leveraged ideas around design, digital, people, menu innovation and value from other markets to enhance the customer experience.
driving operational growth in existing restaurants and targeted new restaurant development are top priorities. in 2017, the company sold its businesses in china and hong kong to a licensee. continued successful integration of the segment's new licensee into the system will further enable restaurant growth, menu innovation and convenience strategies suited to each market's customers.
foundational markets foundational markets are a diverse group that share the common goal of enhancing critical elements that differentiate mcdonald's - the menu and the customer experience. the segment is committed to running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including drive-thru and delivery.
2018 outlook the following information is provided to assist in forecasting the company's future results.
•   changes in systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales, net restaurant unit expansion, and the potential impacts of hyper-inflation. the company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2018 systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies).
•   the company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. however, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the u.s. or the international lead segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 5 to 6 cents.
•   effective january 1, 2018, the company adopted the guidance issued in accounting standards codification 606, "revenue recognition - revenue from contracts with customers". this standard changed the way initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms are recognized. under the new guidance, initial franchise fees will be recognized evenly over the franchise term. the company expects the adoption of this guidance to negatively impact 2018 consolidated franchised revenues and franchised margins by approximately $50 million.
•   with about 75% of mcdonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the company's commodity costs. for the full-year 2018, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 1% to 2% in the u.s. and increase about 2% in the international lead segment.
•   based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the company expects interest expense for the full-year 2018 to increase about 5% to 7% compared with 2017 due primarily to higher average debt balances.
•   a significant part of the company's operating income is generated outside the u.s., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, british pound, australian dollar and canadian dollar. collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the company's operating income outside the u.s. if all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 30 cents.
•   the company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2018 to be in the 25-27% range, with volatility between the quarters. certain aspects of the tax act are expected to be clarified, and as such, could impact the company's tax rate.
•   the company expects capital expenditures for 2018 to be approximately $2.4 billion. about $1.5 billion will be dedicated to our u.s. business, primarily focused on accelerating the pace of eotf. we expect to complete eotf at nearly 4,000 additional u.s. restaurants in 2018, mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report resulting in about half of the total u.s. restaurants modernized by the end of 2018. of the remaining capital, about half will be dedicated to new restaurant openings and the remainder will be allocated to reinvestment in continued expansion of eotf around the world. the company's capital will contribute towards about 250 restaurant openings, while developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute capital towards the opening of approximately 750 restaurants, for a total of about 1,000 expected restaurant openings in 2018. the company expects net additions of about 600 restaurants in 2018.
•   the company expects to realize net annual g&amp;a savings of about $500 million from its g&amp;a base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. through the end of 2017, the company realized cumulative savings of about $300 million and expects to fully realize its targeted $500 million of net savings in 2019.
•   the company expects an incremental cash flow benefit of $400 to $500 million annually as a result of the tax act, prior to any reinvestment.
•   the company expects to return about $24 billion to shareholders over the three-year period ending 2019. as the business grows, the company also expects to modestly increase its debt levels, while maintaining its credit metrics within current ranges.
•   beginning in 2019, the company expects to achieve the following long-term, average annual (constant currency) financial targets:

net income and diluted earnings per common share in 2017, net income increased 11% (11% in constant currencies) to $5.2 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 17% (17% in constant currencies) to $6.37. foreign currency translation had no impact on diluted earnings per share.
in 2016, net income increased 3% (6% in constant currencies) to $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 13% (16% in constant currencies) to $5.44. foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.11 on diluted earnings per share.
results in 2017 reflected stronger operating performance, g&a savings and improved performance in japan, which enabled the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in japan. 2017 results included approximately $700 million of net tax cost associated with the tax act, reflecting provisional amounts related to the deemed repatriation charge of approximately $1.2 billion, partly offset by a benefit of approximately $500 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted u.s. corporate tax rate of 21%. in addition to the $0.82 per share of net tax cost associated with the tax act, 2017 results included a net benefit of $0.53 per share consisting of an approximate $850 million gain on the sale of the company's businesses in china and hong kong, offset in part by $150 million of current year restructuring and non-cash impairment charges in connection with the company's global g&a and refranchising initiatives. excluding the above items, as well as $342 million of prior year strategic charges, net income was $5.4 billion, an increase of 10% (10% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share was $6.66, an increase of 16% (16% in constant currencies).
results in 2016 benefited from stronger operating performance and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, mostly in the u.s. results in 2016 included $342 million, or $0.28 per share, of strategic charges.
the company repurchased 31.4 million shares of its stock for $4.6 billion in 2017 and 92.3 million shares of its stock for $11.1 billion in 2016, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share.
revenues the company's revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.
between 2015 and 2017, the company accelerated the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales.
in 2017, revenues decreased 7% (8% in constant currencies) and in 2016, revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies). for both periods, the decreases in revenues were due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales.

* unlike comparable sales, the company has not excluded hyper-inflationary market results from systemwide sales as these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records revenues. the difference between comparable sales growth rates and systemwide sales growth rates are due to both restaurant expansion and the hyper-inflationary impact.
franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, but are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. the following table presents franchised sales and the related increases/(decreases):

•   u.s.: in 2017, the company-operated margin percent decreased as strong comparable sales were offset by higher commodity and labor costs as well as additional depreciation costs related to eotf. in 2016, the increase was due to a higher average check and lower commodity costs, partly offset by the impact of negative guest counts and higher labor costs.
•   international lead markets: in 2017 and 2016, the increases in the company-operated margin percent were primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor and occupancy costs. 2017 was also negatively impacted by higher commodity costs.
•   high growth markets: in 2017, the increase in the company-operated margin percent was primarily due to strong comparable sales and the benefit of lower depreciation in china and hong kong. this increase was partly offset by negative comparable sales in south korea and the impact of refranchising. in 2016, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales and improved restaurant profitability in china, which benefited from value-added tax ("vat") reform, partly offset by higher labor costs across the segment.

selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales was 2.5% in 2017, 2.8% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2015. management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall mcdonald's business.
in connection with our turnaround plan, the company established a net selling, general and administrative savings target of $500 million from its g&a base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. the company expects to fully realize its targeted $500 million of net savings in 2019.

•   u.s.: in 2017, the increase in operating income reflected higher franchised margin dollars and g&amp;a savings, partly offset by lower company-operated margin dollars. in 2016, the increase reflected higher franchised margin dollars and higher gains from sales of restaurant businesses, partly offset by the negative impact from lapping the 2015 gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property.
•   international lead markets: in 2017 and 2016, the constant currency operating income increase was primarily due to sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars. in addition, 2017 benefited from a property disposition gain in australia.

•   foundational markets and corporate: in 2017, the constant currency operating income increase reflected the company's refranchising initiatives, higher g&amp;a costs at the corporate level due to restaurant technology expenditures, and improved performance in japan, which enabled the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in japan. results also reflected the benefit from comparison to the prior year's strategic charges. in 2016, the increase reflected japan's strong performance, partly offset by the net impact of the current and prior year impairment and restructuring charges from the company's global refranchising and restructuring initiatives.

cash provided by operations totaled $5.6 billion and free cash flow was $3.7 billion in 2017, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.1 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion in 2016. the company's free cash flow conversion rate was 71% in 2017, and 90% in 2016 (see reconciliation in exhibit 12). in 2017, cash provided by operations decreased by $508 million or 8% compared with 2016, as improved operating results were more than offset by higher income tax payments in the u.s. and other working capital changes. in 2016, cash provided by operations decreased $480 million or 7% compared with 2015, primarily due to higher income tax payments primarily outside the u.s. and other working capital changes, partly offset by higher net income.
cash provided by investing activities totaled $562 million in 2017, an increase of $1.5 billion compared with 2016. the increase is primarily due to proceeds associated with the sale of the company's businesses in china and hong kong. cash used for investing activities totaled $982 million in 2016, a decrease of $438 million compared with 2015. the decrease primarily reflected higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses.
cash used for financing activities totaled $5.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of $6 billion compared with 2016, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by a decrease in net borrowings. cash used for financing activities totaled $11.3 billion in 2016, an increase of $12.0 billion compared with 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings and higher treasury stock purchases.
the company's cash and equivalents balance was $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion at year end 2017 and 2016, respectively. in addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.

(1)   primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures new restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. these costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. although the company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional mcdonald's restaurants in the u.s. averaged approximately $3.9 million in 2017.
the company owned 45% to 50% of the land and 70% to 75% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2017 and 2016.

in december 2015, the company's board of directors approved a $15 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date ("2016 program"). in july 2017, the company's board of directors terminated the 2016 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective july 28, 2017, that authorizes the purchase of up to $15 billion of the company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. in 2017, approximately 31.4 million shares were repurchased for $4.7 billion, of which approximately 17.3 million shares or $2.7 billion were repurchased under the new program.
the company has paid dividends on its common stock for 42 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. the 2017 full-year dividend of $3.83 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.94 per share, with an increase to $1.01 per share paid in the fourth quarter. this 7% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report 25
$4.04 per share annual dividend and reflects the company's confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. as in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the company's board of directors.
financial position and capital resources total assets and returns total assets increased $2.8 billion or 9% in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and an increase in cash and equivalents, partly offset by the impact of refranchising. approximately 85% of total assets were in the u.s., international lead markets and high growth markets at year-end 2017. net property and equipment increased $1.2 billion in 2017, primarily due to capital expenditures and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partly offset by depreciation and the impact of refranchising. net property and equipment represented about 65% of total assets at year-end.
operating income and month-end asset balances are used to compute return on average assets. for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, return on average assets was 29.0%, 23.0% and 20.9%, respectively.
in 2017, return on average assets increased primarily due to higher operating income, which included the gain on the sale of the company's businesses in china and hong kong. in 2016, return on average assets increased due to higher operating income and lower average assets. operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. the inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about three percentage points for all years presented.
financing and market risk the company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. debt obligations at december 31, 2017 totaled $29.5 billion, compared with $26.0 billion at december 31, 2016. the net increase in 2017 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $3.1 billion.

standard & poor's and moody's currently rate, with a stable outlook, the company's commercial paper a-2 and p-2, respectively; and its long-term debt bbb+ and baa1, respectively. to access the debt capital markets, the company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings.
certain of the company's debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. there are no provisions in the company's debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the company's business. under existing authorization from the company's board of directors, at december 31, 2017, the company had $15.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. in addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the u.s. securities and exchange commission ("sec") and a global medium-term notes program, the company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the u.s. and global markets (see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). debt maturing in 2018 is $1.8 billion of long-term corporate debt. the company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. as of december 31, 2017, the company's subsidiaries also had $268 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.
the company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. all swaps are over-the-counter instruments.
26 mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders' equity. total foreign currency-denominated debt was $12.4 billion and $8.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. in addition, where practical, the company's restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. see the summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. at december 31, 2017, the company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions. the company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the company's supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.
the company's net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. the company's largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:
foreign currency net asset exposures in millions of u.s. dollars        2017            2016
british pounds sterling          $1,877          $1,340
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company's results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the u.s. dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company's anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. based on the results of these analyses of the company's financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2017 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2017 levels would materially affect the company's results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.
liquidity the company has significant operations outside the u.s. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. a significant portion of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations.
the company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of december 31, 2017.
consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. we also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities.
as a result of the tax act, the company expects an incremental cash flow benefit of $400 to $500 million annually due to a reduction of the u.s. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% partly offset by a $1.2 billion 2017 tax cost on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be paid over the next 8 years.
in the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the u.s. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions.
contractual obligations and commitments the company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. in addition, the company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the company's borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. the following table summarizes the company's contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31, 2017. see discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
(1)   the maturities include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $2.0 billion, as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in december 2019. debt obligations do not include the impact of noncash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs, and accrued interest.
in the u.s., the company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of internal revenue service ("irs") limitations. at december 31, 2017, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $484 million.
at december 31, 2017, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.2 billion. in addition, a liability of approximately $1.2 billion was recorded in 2017 resulting from the mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report tax act, which imposed a deemed repatriation tax on the company's undistributed foreign earnings. this tax liability will be paid over eight years beginning in 2018.
there are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business.  such commitments are generally shorter term in nature, will be funded from operating cash flows, and are not significant to the company's overall financial position.
other matters critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. the company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:
•   property and equipment property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management's estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.
•   businesses held for sale assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2016 primarily consisted of balances related to businesses in china and hong kong. in december 2016, the company's board of directors approved an agreement for the company to sell its existing businesses in china and hong kong to a licensee. based on this approval, the company concluded that these markets were "held for sale" as of december 31, 2016 in accordance with the requirements of asc 360 "property, plant and equipment". the company completed the sale of these businesses on july 31, 2017.
•   share-based compensation the company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ("rsus") to employees and nonemployee directors. the expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. the company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period.
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. the pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. the company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company's stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. for performance-based rsus granted beginning in 2016, the company includes a relative total shareholder return ("tsr") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. the fair value of performance-based rsus that include the tsr modifier is determined using a monte carlo valuation model.
•   long-lived assets impairment review long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. in assessing the recoverability of the company's long-lived assets, the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the company's experience and knowledge of its operations. these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. a key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. if the company's estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to record impairment charges. based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts.
•   litigation accruals in the ordinary course of business, the company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. a determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. the company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
•   income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. this could result in a mcdonald's corporation 2017 annual report charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. the most significant new developments in 2017 and 2016 are described below.
in 2017 and 2016, the company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $144 million and $150 million, respectively. these increases primarily resulted from the evaluation of new information during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. as a result of this new information, the company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits. see the income taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements for the related tax reconciliations.
in 2015, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued a revenue agent report ("rar") that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the company's u.s. federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. also in 2015, the company filed a protest with the irs appeals office related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. during 2017, the company received a response to its protest, and, as of december 31, 2017, is awaiting scheduling of an opening conference with irs appeals. the company expects resolution on these issues in either 2018 or 2019.
in 2017, the irs completed its examination of the company's u.s. federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. although at december 31, 2017 the irs had not yet issued its rar for these years, when issued it is expected to result in the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 rar. consequently, it is expected that the transfer pricing matters for 2011 and 2012 will be addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeal, such that resolution is expected in either 2018 or 2019.
in december 2015, the european commission opened a formal investigation directly with the luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid. if this matter is adversely resolved, luxembourg may be required to assess, and the company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. as of december 31, 2017, no decision has been published with respect to this investigation.
while the company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with topic 740 - income taxes of the accounting standards codification ("asc").
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ("tax act") was enacted on december 22, 2017. the tax act reduces the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. at december 31, 2017, the company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the tax act. however, as described below, the company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. for these items, a provisional net tax cost of approximately $700 million is recognized and is included as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations.
provisional amounts deferred tax assets and liabilities: the company remeasured certain u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. however, the company is still analyzing certain aspects of the tax act and refining the calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. a provisional amount was recorded related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance, resulting in a provision for income taxes benefit of approximately $500 million.
foreign tax effects: the one-time transition tax is based on the total post-1986 earnings and profits ("e&p") that the company had previously deferred from u.s. income taxes. a provisional amount was recorded for the one-time transition tax liability, resulting in a provision for income taxes cost of approximately $1.2 billion. the company has not yet completed the calculation of the total post-1986 foreign e&p. further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. this amount may change when the calculation of post-1986 foreign e&p and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets are finalized. additionally, the provisional amount includes an estimate of foreign withholding taxes related to the e&p subject to the transition tax. a provisional deferred tax liability has been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. however, the company is still evaluating how the tax act will affect the company's accounting position related to the indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. during the measurement period, the company may reflect adjustments to this provisional amount upon obtaining, preparing, and analyzing the necessary information to complete the accounting under asc 740.
effects of changing prices-inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

item 1a.  risk factors our business involves numerous risks and uncertainties. you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10-k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission in evaluating our business. if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. in such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. our past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. these risks involve forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.
the future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors.
the future trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:
•   our results of operations and financial performance;
•   general economic, industry and market conditions worldwide;
•   our ability to outperform the market, and outperform at a level that meets or exceeds our investors' expectations;
•   the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;
•   developments generally affecting the semiconductor industry;
•   commencement of or developments relating to our involvement in litigation;
•   investor perceptions of us and our business strategies;
•   changes in securities analysts' expectations or our failure to meet those expectations;
•   actions by institutional or other large stockholders;
•   actual or anticipated manufacturing capacity limitations;
•   developments with respect to intellectual property rights;
•   introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
•   our sale of common stock or other securities in the future;
•   conditions and trends in technology industries;
•   our loss of key customers;
•   changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;
•   any mergers, acquisitions or divestitures of assets undertaken by us;
•   our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity;
•   our ability to increase our gross margins;
•   market reactions to guidance from other semiconductor companies or third-party research groups;
•   market reactions to merger and acquisition activities in the semiconductor industry, and rumors or expectations of further consolidation in the industry;
•   investments in sales and marketing resources to enter new markets;
•   costs of increasing wafer capacity and qualifying additional third-party wafer fabrication facilities;
•   our ability to repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program and pay quarterly cash dividends to stockholders; and,
•   changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets.
in addition, the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
we expect our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year over year, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance and could cause our stock price to decline and be volatile.
our revenue, expenses, and results of operations are difficult to predict, have varied significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. we expect fluctuations to continue for a number of reasons, including:
•   changes in general demand for electronic products as a result of worldwide macroeconomic conditions;
•   changes in business conditions at our distributors, value-added resellers and/or end-customers;
•   changes in general economic conditions in the countries where our products are sold or used;
•   the timing of developments and related expenses in our litigation matters;
•   the loss of key customers or our inability to attract new customers due to customer and prospective customer concerns about being litigation targets;
•   continued dependence on turns business (orders received and shipped within the same fiscal quarter);
•   continued dependence on the asian markets for our customer base;
•   increases in assembly costs due to commodity price increases, such as the price of gold;
•   the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors;
•   changes in our revenue mix between original equipment manufacturers ("oems"), original design manufacturers ("odms"), distributors and value-added resellers;
•   changes in product mix, product returns, and actual and potential product liability;
•   the acceptance of our new products in the marketplace;
•   our ability to develop new process technologies and achieve volume production;
•   our ability to meet customer product demand in a timely manner;
•   the scheduling, rescheduling, or cancellation of orders by our customers;
•   the cyclical nature of demand for our customers' products;
•   fluctuations in our estimate for stock rotation reserves;
•   our ability to manage our inventory levels, including the levels of inventory held by our distributors;
•   seasonality and variability in the consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications markets;
•   the availability of adequate manufacturing capacity from our outside suppliers;
•   increases in prices for finished wafers due to general capacity shortages;
•   the potential loss of future business resulting from capacity issues;
•   changes in manufacturing yields;
•         movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates;
•   the impact of the 2017 tax act on our income tax provision and cash flows; and
•   stock-based compensation charges primarily resulting from performance and market-based equity awards granted to our employees.
due to the factors noted above and other risks described in this section, many of which are beyond our control, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter or year-over-year comparisons to predict our future financial performance. unfavorable changes in any of the above factors may seriously harm our business and results of operations, and may cause our stock price to decline and be volatile.
our business has been and may be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions.
in recent years, global credit and financial markets experienced disruptions, and may experience disruptions in the future, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. economic uncertainty affects businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. the tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish liquidity and capital availability. demand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the united states, europe, china and the rest of the world. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic disruption or subsequent economic recovery worldwide, in the united states, in our industry, or in the different markets that we serve. these and other economic factors have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.
we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis.
our profitability is dependent on many factors, including:
•   our sales, which because of our turns business, are difficult to accurately forecast;
•   the cancellation or rescheduling of our customers' orders, which may occur without significant penalty to our customers;
•   changes in general demand for electronic products as a result of worldwide macroeconomic conditions;
•   changes in revenue mix between oems, odms, distributors and value-added resellers;
•   changes in product mix, and actual and potential product liability;
•   changes in revenue mix between end market segments (i.e. consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications);
•   our competition, which could adversely impact our selling prices and our potential sales;
•   our manufacturing costs, including our ability to negotiate with our vendors and our ability to efficiently run our test facility in china;
•   manufacturing capacity constraints;
•   level of activity in our legal proceedings, which could result in significant legal expenses;
•   the impact of the 2017 tax act on our income tax provision and cash flows; and,
•   stock-based compensation charges primarily resulting from performance and market-based equity awards granted to our employees;
•   our operating expenses, including general and administrative expenses, selling and marketing expenses, and research and development expenses relating to products that will not be introduced and will not generate revenue until later periods, if at all.
we may not achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. unfavorable changes in our operations, including any of the factors noted above, may have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual profitability.
in the past, our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products. we are subject to numerous risks and factors that could cause a decrease in our growth rates compared to past periods, including increased competition, loss of certain of our customers, unfavorable changes in our operations, reduced global electronics demand, end-customer market downturn, market acceptance and penetration of our current and future products and litigation. a material decrease in our growth rates could adversely affect our stock price and results of operations.
in june 2014, the board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. the declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, statutory requirements of delaware law, compliance with the terms of future indebtedness and credit facilities and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. our dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts. a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.
we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to or better than what we have experienced in the past, which would impact our overall gross margin and financial performance.
our success depends on products that are differentiated in the market, which result in gross margins that have historically been above industry averages. should we fail to improve our gross margin in the future, and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in higher gross margins than industry averages, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has produced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns, could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
historically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and, at various times, has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand. these conditions have caused significant variances in product demand and production capacity, as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices. the industry may experience severe or prolonged downturns in the future, which could result in downward pressure on the price of our products as well as lower demand for our products. because significant portions of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales, we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall. these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.
in recent years, there has been a trend toward semiconductor industry consolidation. we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to improve the leverage of growing research and development costs, strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry, or become unable to continue operations unless they find an acquirer or consolidate with another company. in addition, companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. we believe that semiconductor industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
if demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve, our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.
we believe that the application of our products in the consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue. if the demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve, our revenue will decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. in addition, as technology evolves, the ability to integrate the functionalities of various components, including our discrete semiconductor products, onto a single chip and/or onto other components of systems containing our products increases. should our customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer, demand for our products could decrease, and our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.
we may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to maintain or expand our business.
our competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. a fundamental shift in technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within these markets. our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products, which could result in product obsolescence, decreased revenue, and/or a loss of market share to competitors.
as we develop new product lines, we must adapt to market conditions that are unfamiliar to us, such as competitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past. some of our new product lines require us to re-equip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past. if we are unable to adapt rapidly to these new and additional conditions, we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets.
the success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long-term market demand and future technological developments, as well as on a variety of specific implementation factors, including:
•   timely and efficient completion of process design and device structure improvements;
•   timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing, assembly, and test processes;
•   the ability to secure and effectively utilize fabrication capacity in different geometries;
•   product performance;
•   product availability;
•   product quality and reliability; and,
•   effective marketing, sales and service.
to the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets, our revenue and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we may face competition from customers developing products internally.
our customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources. some customers have traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally. the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers' acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products. future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third-party sourcing for products as an alternative to in-house development. customers may in the future continue to use internally developed components. they also may decide to develop or acquire components, technologies or products that are similar to, or that may be substituted for, our products. if our customers fail to accept our products as an alternative, if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products, or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in asia and have significant operations in asia, which may expose us to political, cultural, regulatory, economic, foreign exchange, and operational risks.
we derive most of our revenue from customers located in asia through direct sales or indirect sales through distribution arrangements and value-added reseller agreements with parties located in asia. as a result, we are subject to increased risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations. for the year ended december 31, 2017, 89% of our revenue was from customers in asia. there are risks inherent in doing business in asia, and internationally in general, including:
•   changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including tax laws in the u.s. and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;
•   trade restrictions, including restrictions imposed by the united states on trading with parties in foreign countries;
•   currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting intra-company transactions;
•   the fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other foreign currencies, which could affect the competitiveness of our products;
•   changes in tax regulations in china that may impact our tax status in chengdu, hangzhou and other regions where we have significant operations;
•   multi-tiered distribution channels that lack visibility to end customer pricing and purchase patterns;
•   international political relationships and threats of war;
•   work stoppages and infrastructure problems due to adverse weather conditions or natural disasters;
•   work stoppages related to employee dissatisfaction;
•   economic, social and political instability;
•   enforcing contracts generally; and,
if we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers, we will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks, which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and financial condition.
we depend on a limited number of customers, including distributors, for a significant percentage of our revenue.
historically, we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers, including distributors. for example, sales to our largest distributor accounted for 17% of our total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2017. we continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. because we rely on a limited number of customers for significant percentages of our revenue, a decrease in demand or significant pricing pressure for our products from any of our major customers for any reason (including due to competition, market conditions, catastrophic events or otherwise) could have a materially adverse impact on our financial conditions and results of operations.
we are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or the fcpa. our failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to the fcpa, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits, along with various other anti-corruption laws. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. we have significant operations in asia, which places us in frequent contact with persons who may be considered "foreign officials" under the fcpa, resulting in an elevated risk of potential fcpa violations. if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anti-corruption laws by the u.s. or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements, value-added resellers and direct customers, and the loss of any one of these distributors, value-added resellers or direct customers or failure to collect a receivable from them could adversely affect our operations and financial position.
we market our products through distribution arrangements and value-added resellers and through our direct sales and applications support organization to customers that include oems, odms and electronic manufacturing service providers ("emss"). receivables from our customers are generally not secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible. sales to our largest distributor accounted for 17% of our total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2017. significant deterioration in the liquidity or financial condition of any of our major customers or any group of our customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results. we primarily conduct our sales on a purchase order basis, and we do not have any long-term supply commitments.
moreover, we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of oems. although we communicate with oems in an attempt to achieve "design wins," which are decisions by oems and/or odms to incorporate our products, we do not have purchase commitments from these end users. therefore, there can be no assurance that the oems and/or odms will continue to incorporate our ics into their products. oem technical specifications and requirements can change rapidly, and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an end-customer for whom we have had previous design wins. we cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large oems, that our direct customers will continue to be successful in selling to the oems, or that the oems will be successful in selling products which incorporate our ics. the loss of any significant customer, any material reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or by their oem customers, the cancellation of a significant customer order, or the cancellation or delay of a customer's or an oem's significant program or product could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
due to the nature of our business as a component supplier, we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses.
because we provide components for end products and systems, demand for our products is influenced by our customers' end product demand. as a result, we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and expenses. our revenue depends on the timing, size, and speed of commercial introductions of end products and systems that incorporate our products, all of which are inherently difficult to forecast, as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems. in addition, demand for our products is influenced by our customers' ability to manage their inventory. our sales to distributors are subject to higher volatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which, in itself, is inherently difficult to forecast. if our customers, including distributors, do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers' demand, our shipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly on a quarterly basis.
our ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of our suppliers.
although we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements, their ability to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity, particularly capacity in the geometries we require, at the facilities in which they manufacture wafers for us.  as a result, this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product sales and revenue growth. in addition, an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us. our suppliers may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements. if our suppliers extend lead times, limit supplies or the types of capacity we require, or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors, our revenue and gross margin may materially decline. in addition, if we experience supply delays or limitations, our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us and/or seek alternative solutions to meet their demand, which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. delays in increasing third-party manufacturing capacity may also limit our ability to meet customer demand.
we currently depend on third-party suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products. if any of our wafer suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained and are unable and/or fail to provide us sufficient wafers at acceptable yields and at anticipated costs, our revenue and gross margin may decline or we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders.
we have a supply arrangement with certain suppliers for the production of wafers. should any of our suppliers become insolvent or capacity constrained, we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders, which would likely cause a decline in our revenue.
while certain aspects of our relationship with these suppliers are contractual, many important aspects of this relationship depend on our suppliers' continued cooperation and our management of the supplier relationships. in addition, the fabrication of ics is a highly complex and precise process. problems in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ics on each wafer to be non-functional. this could potentially reduce yields. the failure of our suppliers to supply us wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders for our products and would likely cause a decline in our revenue.
further, as is common in the semiconductor industry, our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice. if our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the corresponding wafers, we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell, which would adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
we might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors are disrupted or terminated.
we do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products are assembled by third-party subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by third-party subcontractors. also, due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors, we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to assemble or test our products. in addition, events such as global economic crises may materially impact our assembly suppliers' ability to operate. any future product delivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.
there may be unanticipated costs associated with adding to or supplementing our third-party suppliers' manufacturing capacity.
we anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of third-party supply foundries, assembly shops, and testing facilities for our products. in order to facilitate such growth, we may need to enter into strategic transactions, investments and other activities. such activities are subject to a number of risks, including:
•   the costs and expense associated with such activities;
•   the availability of modern foundries to be developed, acquired, leased or otherwise made available to us or our third-party suppliers;
•   the ability of foundries and our third-party suppliers to obtain the advanced equipment used in the production of our products;
•   unforeseen environmental, engineering or manufacturing qualification problems relating to existing or new foundry facilities, including delays in qualification of new foundries by our customers.
these and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our third-party suppliers' capacity.
we purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products, and if demand is not as expected, we may have insufficient or excess inventory, which could adversely impact our financial position.
as a fabless semiconductor company, we purchase our inventory from third-party manufacturers in advance of selling our products. we place orders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products. while most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation penalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels, we must nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers. in the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to unexpected increases in orders or unavailability of product within the timeframe that is required, we may have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands. in the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders, unexpected order cancellations, injunctions due to patent litigation, or product returns, we may have excess inventory which, if not sold, may need to be written down or would result in a decrease in our revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold. if any of these situations were to arise, it could have a material impact on our business and financial position.
the 2017 tax act is expected to have significant effects on our income tax expense, which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
in december 2017, the 2017 tax act was enacted and includes a broad range of tax reforms, including changes to corporate tax rates, business deductions and international tax provisions. many of these provisions significantly differ from prior u.s. tax law, resulting in material tax accounting implications for us. some of the significant new requirements include, but are not limited to, a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, a remeasurement of our deferred taxes due to the change in the corporate tax rate, taxation of certain global intangible low-taxed income under the international tax provisions, and limitations on the deductibility of performance-based compensation for officers. some of these provisions, such as the deemed repatriation transition tax and remeasurement of deferred tax assets, had immediate accounting implications which resulted in a significant increase in our tax expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017. as we continue to evaluate the potential implications of the 2017 tax act on our financial statements, any increase in our income tax expense in future periods could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. in addition, the deemed repatriation transition tax liability, which will be payable over eight years, will adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition in future periods. any changes to our corporate tax planning and strategies as a result of the 2017 tax act may not result in a favorable impact on our income tax expense in future periods.
the calculation of the tax impact and exposures under the 2017 tax act is complex. it requires the collection of information not regularly produced by us, the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment in determining our tax provision. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the 2017 tax act, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position. furthermore, we will need to evaluate whether changes to our existing processes and controls are necessary to address the financial reporting effects. if we fail to correctly interpret the tax law or implement effective internal controls on gathering, analyzing and reviewing data used in our calculations, our income tax provision could be misstated, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
the complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our financial statements.
due to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision, including the effects of the 2017 tax act, we engage third-party tax advisors to assist us in the calculation. if we or our tax advisors fail to resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the future, we could be subject to errors, which, if material, would result in us having to restate our financial statements. restatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations, damage our reputation, and/or have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.
changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws such as the 2017 tax act, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof and discrete items such as future exercises or dispositions of stock options and restricted stock releases. in addition, we are subject to potential future examinations of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. for example, our u.s. federal income tax returns for the years ended december 31, 2005 through december 31, 2007 were examined by the irs. we reached a resolution with the irs in april 2015 and recorded a one-time net charge of $2.7 million to our income tax provision in the second quarter of 2015. we assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
implementation of an enterprise resource planning ("erp") or other information technology systems could result in significant disruptions to our operations.
from time to time, we may implement new erp software solutions or upgrade existing systems. implementation of these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of system providers and internal business teams. we may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including loss or corruption of financial, business or customer data. in addition, transitioning to these new systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources. difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or significant system failures could disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition or results of operations.
system security risks, data protection or privacy breaches, cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations and/or harm our reputation, and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue, increase our expenses, negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price.
experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.
in the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data on our internal systems, network and servers, such as proprietary business and financial information, and confidential data pertaining to our customers, suppliers and business partners. the secure maintenance of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features of our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy. we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data. however, these security measures cannot provide absolute security.  although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems and solutions, any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks, creating system disruptions or slowdowns, and the information stored on our networks could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. if any of these types of security breaches were to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data, our relationships with our business partners and customers could be materially damaged, our reputation could be materially harmed, and we could be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible significant liability.
portions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and our remediation efforts may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. delayed sales or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
if we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers, we could be prevented from selling many of our products and/or be required to pay substantial damages. an unfavorable outcome or an additional award of damages, attorneys' fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline significantly and could severely harm our business and operating results.
from time to time we are a party to various legal proceedings. if we are not successful in litigation that could be brought against us or our customers, we could be ordered to pay monetary fines and/or damages. if we are found liable for willful patent infringement, damages could be significant. we and/or our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products. moreover, our customers and end-users could decide not to use our products, and our products and our customers' accounts payable to us could be seized. finally, interim developments in these proceedings could increase the volatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we will or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings.
given our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either have arisen or may arise, our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our publicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter, which could contribute to increased volatility in our stock price and financial condition.
historically, we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with the level of activity in the proceeding. it is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter, which adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general. we may also be subject to unanticipated legal proceedings, which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses. if we fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal expenses, our stock price could be materially impacted.
future legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources.
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in our industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves against additional infringement claims. such litigation is very costly. in the event any third party makes a new infringement claim against us or our customers, we could incur additional ongoing legal expenses. in addition, in connection with these legal proceedings, we may be required to post bonds to defend our intellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time, until such dispute is resolved. if our legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts, our capital resources and financial condition could be adversely affected. further, if we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses, our financial condition could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. our management team may also be required to devote a great deal of time, effort and energy to these legal proceedings, which could divert management's attention from focusing on our operations and adversely affect our business.
failure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively affect our ability to compete.
we rely heavily on our proprietary technologies. our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products. we pursue patents for some of our new products and unique technologies, and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees' commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology, know-how and processes. despite the precautions we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products, or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies, including through patents. however, there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states. our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business.
the market for government-backed student loan auction-rate securities has suffered a decline in liquidity which may impact the liquidity and potential value of our investment portfolio.
the market for government-backed student loan auction-rate securities became illiquid in 2008. since 2008, we have redeemed 87% of the original portfolio of our auction-rate securities at par and continue to hold $5.6 million in principal amount as of december 31, 2017. it is unclear as to when the remaining balance of our auction-rate securities will regain their liquidity. the underlying maturity of these auction-rate securities is up to 30 years. we have historically recorded temporary and other-than-temporary impairment charges on these investments. the valuation is subject to fluctuations in the future, which will depend on many factors, including the quality of underlying collateral, estimated time for liquidity including potential to be called or restructured, underlying final maturity, insurance guaranty and market conditions, among others. should there be further deterioration in the market for auction-rate securities, the value of our portfolio may decline, which may have an adverse impact on our cash position and our earnings. if the accounting rules for these securities change, there may be an adverse impact on our earnings.
we face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting.
effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports. if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud or other financial misconduct, our business and operating results could be harmed. our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. this, in turn, could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and/or have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock, and could subject us to stockholder litigation. in addition, we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date, which may impact the reliability of our financial reporting and financial statements.
our products must meet specifications, and undetected defects and failures may occur, which may cause customers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk.
our customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality, performance, and reliability that our products must meet. ics as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments, which might require product replacement or recall. further, our third-party manufacturing processes or changes thereof, or raw material used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail. we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality, performance or reliability problems. our standard warranty period is generally one to two years, which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures. if defects and failures occur in our products, we could experience lost revenue, increased costs, including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support, cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments, and product returns or discounts, any of which would harm our operating results.
in addition, product liability claims may be asserted with respect to our technology or products. although we currently have insurance, there can be no assurance that we have obtained a sufficient amount of insurance coverage, that asserted claims will be within the scope of coverage of the insurance, or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any asserted claims.
the price and availability of commodities (e.g., gold, copper and silicon) may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
our products incorporate commodities such as gold, copper and silicon. an increase in the price or a decrease in the availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other foreign currencies, including the renminbi, may adversely affect results of operations.
our manufacturing and packaging suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in china for the foreseeable future. if the value of the renminbi rises against the u.s. dollar, there could be an increase in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located in the u.s., which could adversely affect our operations. in addition, our sales are primarily denominated in the u.s. dollar. if the value of the u.s dollar rises against other currencies, it may adversely affect the demand for our products in international markets, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
we incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to the timing of payments for transactions between the u.s. and our foreign subsidiaries, which are reported in interest and other income in the statements of operations. fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the foreign currencies could increase the amount of foreign currency exchange losses we record, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
our business is subject to various governmental laws and regulations, and compliance with these regulations may impact our revenue and cause us to incur significant expense. if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
our business is subject to various significant laws and other legal requirements imposed by the u.s. and other countries we conduct business with, including export control laws such as the u.s. export administration regulations. these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time. we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. in addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could negatively impact our results of operations. we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our products to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in many countries as these requirements change. if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, we could be required to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products are brought into compliance.
environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations.
we are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of certain products. such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate, including various european union member countries and countries in asia. there can be no assurance that similar laws and regulations will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs, possible delays in delivering products, and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future product replacements if the cost were to become prohibitive.
we and our manufacturing partners are or will be subject to extensive chinese government regulation, and the benefit of various incentives from chinese governments that we and our manufacturing partners receive may be reduced or eliminated, which could increase our costs or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china.
we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china and most of our manufacturing partners are located in china. the chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in china. additionally, china's government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion in china. it exercises significant control over china's economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.
personal privacy, cyber security, and data protection are becoming increasingly significant issues in china. to address these issues, the standing committee of the national people's congress promulgated the cyber security law of the people's republic of china (the "cyber security law"), which took effect on june 1, 2017. the cyber security law sets forth various requirements relating to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of data, among other things. various chinese agencies are expected to issue additional regulations in the future to define these requirements more precisely. these requirements may increase our costs of compliance. we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these regulatory requirements. any failure to comply with the cyber security law and the relevant regulations and policies could result in further cost and liability to us and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. additionally, increased costs to comply with, and other burdens imposed by, the cyber security law and relevant regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, as well as our customers, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
any additional new regulations or the amendment or modification of previously implemented regulations could require us and our manufacturing partners to change our business plans, increase our costs, or limit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in china, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.
the chinese government and provincial and local governments also have provided, and continue to provide, various incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in china. such incentives include tax rebates, reduced tax rates, favorable lending policies and other measures, some or all of which may be available to our manufacturing partners and to us with respect to our facilities in china. any of these incentives could be reduced or eliminated by governmental authorities at any time. any such reduction or elimination of incentives currently provided to our manufacturing partners could adversely affect our business and operating results.
there are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in china, which could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments.
we have manufacturing and testing facilities in china that began operations in 2006. we face the following risks, among others, with respect to our operations in china:
•   inability to hire and maintain a qualified workforce;
•   inability to maintain appropriate and acceptable manufacturing controls; and,
•   higher than anticipated overhead and other costs of operation.
if we are unable to maintain our facilities in china at fully operational status with qualified workers, appropriate manufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels, we may incur higher costs than our current expense levels, which would affect our gross margins. in addition, if capacity restraints result in significant delays in product shipments, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.
the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased over time and could do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross profits.
average selling prices of semiconductor products in the markets we serve have historically decreased over time. our gross profits and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by reducing our costs, developing new or enhanced products on a timely basis with higher selling prices or gross profits, or increasing our sales volumes. additionally, because we do not operate our own wafer manufacturing or assembly facilities, we may not be able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities, and our costs may even increase, which could also reduce our profit margins.
because of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our expenses, we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve our forecasted sales for our products.
the introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and expenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales. it generally takes us up to 12 months or more to design and manufacture a new product prototype. only after we have a prototype do we introduce the product to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins. this sales process requires us to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success. volume production of products that use our ics, if any, may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale. sales cycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons, including:
•   our customers usually complete an in-depth technical evaluation of our products before they place a purchase order;
•   the commercial adoption of our products by oems and odms is typically limited during the initial release of their product to evaluate product performance and consumer demand;
•   our products must be designed into our customers' products or systems; and,
•   the development and commercial introduction of our customers' products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayed.
as a result of our lengthy sales cycles, we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue. the lengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult. in addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders. our sales are made by purchase orders. because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice, backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales. if customer cancellations or product changes occur, we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses.
our success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.
our success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources into research and development. we expect to have to continue to invest heavily in research and development in the future in order to continue to innovate and introduce new products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability. if we have to invest more resources in research and development than we anticipate, we could see an increase in our operating expenses which may negatively impact our operating results. also, if we are unable to properly manage and effectively utilize our research and development resources, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating results.
in addition, if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. in order to remain competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development.
the loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management personnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business.
our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. we are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives, including michael hsing, our president and chief executive officer, who founded our company and developed our proprietary process technology. in addition, personnel with highly skilled analog and mixed-signal design engineering expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting, integrating or retaining other highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future. if we are unable to retain the services of existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet the demands of our business, including design cycles, our business could be harmed. furthermore, if we lose key personnel, the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could interrupt our operations as the search could take us longer than expected and divert management resources, and the newly hired employee could take longer than expected to integrate into the team.
if we fail to retain key employees in our sales, applications, finance and legal staff or to make continued improvements to our internal systems, particularly in the accounting and finance area, our business may suffer.
if we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales, applications, financial and legal staff, maintain or upgrade our business systems and maintain internal control that meet the demands of our business, our ability to operate effectively will suffer. the operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain these employees, as these employees hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products, and, if they were to terminate their employment, our sales and internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected.
we intend to continue to expand our operations, which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses.
we plan to continue to expand our domestic and foreign operations through internal growth, strategic relationships, and/or acquisitions. we expect that any such expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls. in addition, we are likely to incur significantly higher operating costs. to manage our growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls, as well as hire experienced administrative and financial personnel. if we fail to do so, our growth will be limited. if we fail to effectively manage our planned expansion of operations, our business and operating results may be harmed.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire. in addition, acquisitions could result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders, reduce our cash balances, and cause us to incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities, which could adversely affect our business. we may also be the target of strategic transactions, which could divert our management's attention and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.
as a part of our business strategy, from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings, enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities. as a result of completing acquisitions, we could use a significant portion of our available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt or contingent liabilities, or incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other acquisition-related intangibles. such actions could impact our operating results and the price of our common stock.
in addition, we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons, including competition from other companies in the semiconductor industry, the valuation expectations of acquisition candidates and applicable antitrust laws or related regulations. if we are unable to identify and complete acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings.
we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions. in addition, if we are unsuccessful in integrating any acquired company or business into our operations or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions that could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. some of the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired companies, businesses or assets include those associated with:
•   unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired companies or businesses;
•   conforming the acquired company's standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;
•   coordinating new product and process development;
•   hiring additional management and other critical personnel;
•   increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;
•   difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;
•   difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products;
•   the risk of undisclosed liabilities of the acquired businesses and potential legal disputes with founders or stockholders of acquired companies;
•   our inability to commercialize acquired technologies;
•   the risk that the future business potential as projected is not realized and as a result, we may be required to take a charge to earnings that would impact our profitability;
•   the need to take impairment charges or write-downs with respect to acquired assets and technologies;
•   difficulties in assessing the fair value of earn-out arrangements;
•   diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; and
•   adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers.
in addition, third parties may be interested in acquiring us. we will consider and discuss such transactions as we deem appropriate. such potential transactions may diver the attention of management, and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in investigating and evaluating such transactions, whether or not they are consummated.
if we issue additional shares of stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.
we may issue additional shares of common stock in the future in order to raise additional capital to fund our global operations or in connection with an acquisition. we also issue restricted stock units to employees, which convert into shares of common stock upon vesting. any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution of our stockholders. in addition, the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may result in additional regulatory requirements, such as stockholder approval.
we compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, and our market share may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively.
the analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures to continue. our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue to recruit applications and design talent, our ability to introduce new products, and our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products. we compete with domestic and non-domestic semiconductor companies, many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products. we are in direct and active competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with many manufacturers of such products, of varying size and financial strength. the number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in which we participate.
we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably, or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.
if securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
the trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. we do not have any control over these analysts. if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
major earthquakes or other natural disasters and resulting systems outages may cause us significant losses.
our corporate headquarters, the production facilities of our third-party wafer suppliers, our ic testing and manufacturing facilities, a portion of our assembly and research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to periodic earthquakes. we do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. much of our revenue, as well as our manufacturers and assemblers, are concentrated in asia, particularly in china. such concentration increases the risk that other natural disasters, labor strikes, terrorism, war, political unrest, epidemics, and/or health advisories could disrupt our operations. in addition, we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support services from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively. any of these are subject to failure due to a natural disaster or other disruption. system-wide or local failures that affect our information processing could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear under item 8 in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we are a leading semiconductor company that designs, develops and markets high-performance power solutions. founded in 1997, mps's core strengths include deep system-level and applications knowledge, strong analog design expertise and an innovative proprietary process technology. these combined strengths enable mps to deliver highly integrated monolithic products that offer energy efficient, cost-effective, easy-to-use solutions for systems found in consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications applications. our mission is to reduce total energy consumption in our customers' systems with green, practical and compact solutions. we believe that we differentiate ourselves by offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy efficient, more accurate with respect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions. we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative product categories.
we operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry where there is seasonal demand for certain products. we are not immune from current and future industry downturns, but we have targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the long term.
we work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits ("ics"). this has enabled us to limit our capital expenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths.
following the introduction of a product, our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive an initial customer order for a new product to ramp up. typical lead time for orders is fewer than 90 days. these factors, combined with the fact that orders in the semiconductor industry can typically be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer, make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult.
we derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in asia, where our products are incorporated into end-user products. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenue from sales to customers in asia was 89%, 91% and 91%, respectively. we derive a majority of our revenue from the sales of our dc to dc converter products which serve the consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications markets. we believe our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, inventories, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, and contingencies. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are, by their nature, uncertain and unpredictable, and depend upon, among other things, many factors outside of our control, such as demand for our products and economic conditions.  accordingly, our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ, perhaps significantly, from these estimates.
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition our revenue consists primarily of product sales of assembled and tested integrated circuits and dies in wafer form to the consumer, computing and storage, industrial, automotive and communications markets. the remaining revenue has not been significant historically and primarily includes royalties from licensing arrangements and revenue from wafer testing services for third parties.
we recognize revenue based on the following four criteria: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. determination of criteria (3) and (4) is based on management's judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fees charged for products delivered and the collectability of those fees. the application of these criteria has resulted in us generally recognizing revenue upon shipment or delivery (when title and risk of loss have transferred to customers), including to most of the distributors, original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers.
for each of the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 88% of our sales, respectively, were made through distribution arrangements with third parties. we generally recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery of products to the distributors based on the following considerations:
(1)   the price is fixed or determinable at the date of sale. we do not offer special payment terms (our normal payment terms are 30-45 days for our distributors) or price adjustments to distributors when we recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery.
(3)   the distributors' obligation is unchanged in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage to the products.
(5)   we do not have any obligations for future performance to directly bring about the resale of our products by the distributors.
certain of our large distributors have contracts that include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the previous six months' purchases. we maintain a sales reserve for stock rotation rights, which is based on historical experience of actual stock rotation returns on a per-distributor basis and information related to products in the distribution channel. this reserve is recorded at the time of sale. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, our reserve for stock rotation rights was $2.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
if we enter into arrangements with distributors that have price adjustment or other rights that are not fixed or determinable, we recognize revenue under such arrangements only after the distributors have sold the products to end customers, at which time the price is no longer subject to adjustment and is fixed. three of our u.s.-based distributors have such price adjustment rights and accordingly, we defer revenue recognition on these shipments until the products are sold to the end customers by the distributors. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, our deferred revenue balance before the price adjustments from these distributors was $1.9 million and $3.7 million, and the deferred costs were $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
on january 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606). the primary effects of the new standard for us related to the timing of revenue recognition with the three u.s.-based distributors with price adjustment rights. see "recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of december 31, 2017" in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or its current estimated net realizable value.  we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand, based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. conversely, if market conditions are more favorable, inventory may be sold that was previously reserved.
valuation of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets we evaluate intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. we perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. impairment of intangible assets is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the assets and their carrying value. impairment for goodwill occurs if the fair value of a reporting unit including goodwill is less than its carrying value and is recognized based on the difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the carrying value of the goodwill. the assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and revenue forecasts. if there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future, including macroeconomic and market conditions, we may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets.
accounting for income taxes we recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. we also recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality or uncertainty to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the u.s. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. in addition, we recognize liabilities for potential u.s. and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements in the period such determination is made. we have calculated our uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain estimates and judgments primarily related to transfer pricing, cost sharing and our international tax structure exposure.
on december 22, 2017, the tax legislation commonly known as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "2017 tax act") was enacted, which significantly changed u.s. corporate income tax law. the 2017 tax act made the following material changes: (1) reduction of the corporate income tax rate effective january 1, 2018; (2) replacement of the worldwide tax system with a territorial tax regime, with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings; (3) amendment on the deductibility of executive performance-based compensation, and (4) creation of new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.
as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a valuation allowance of $12.6 million and $27.4 million, respectively, attributable to management's determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in the fourth quarter of 2017, management assessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets and concluded that a full valuation allowance would no longer be needed on the federal deferred tax assets, due principally to the enactment of the 2017 tax act. as a result, we released $21.6 million of valuation allowance which was recorded as a benefit in the income tax provision. in the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize other deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. likewise, should it be determined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination is made.
income tax effects resulting from changes in tax laws are accounted for in the period in which the law is enacted. as of december 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 tax act, including the calculation of the deemed repatriation transition tax and the remeasurement of the deferred taxes. as permitted by staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118") issued by the securities and exchange commission on december 22, 2017, we recorded provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates for the year ended december 31, 2017. these provisional amounts are subject to revisions, possibly materially, as we perform further analysis of the 2017 tax act, collect and prepare necessary financial data, continue to assess our tax positions, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the u.s. treasury department, internal revenue service ("irs"), financial accounting standards board ("fasb"), and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to the income tax provision in the period when the analysis is complete. we expect to complete the analysis within the one-year measurement period ending december 21, 2018, pursuant to sab 118.
contingencies we are a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including potential litigation regarding our shareholders and our intellectual property, challenges to the enforceability or validity of our intellectual property, claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and employment matters. the pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require the expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend. in addition, from time to time, we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities. when this occurs, we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded. in making this determination, management may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. based on the facts and circumstances in each matter, we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated. if we determine a loss is probable and estimable, we record a contingent loss. in determining the amount of a contingent loss, we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations, prior case history and other factors. should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted, for example, if a particular contingent loss does not occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results of operations.
stock-based compensation we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  the fair value of restricted stock units ("rsus") with service conditions or performance conditions is based on the grant date share price. the fair value of rsus with only market conditions, as well as rsus containing both market and performance conditions, is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model.  the fair value of stock options, shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan and rsus with a purchase price feature is estimated using the black-scholes model.
compensation expense related to awards with service conditions is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. compensation expense related to awards subject to market or performance conditions is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche. for awards with only market conditions, compensation expense is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied. for awards with only performance conditions, as well as awards containing both market and performance conditions, we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance criteria will be achieved. management performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors, such as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry forecasts, and internal factors, such as our business and operational objectives and revenue forecasts. changes in the probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch-up adjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date. if the projected achievement was revised upward or if the actual results were higher than the projected achievement, additional compensation expense would be recorded for the awards due to the cumulative catch-up adjustment, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations. conversely, if the projected achievement was revised downward or if the actual results were lower than the projected achievement, previously accrued compensation expense would be reversed for the awards, which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations. as a result, our stock-based compensation expense is subject to volatility and may fluctuate significantly each quarter due to changes in our probability assessment or actual results being different from projections made by management.

revenue for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $470.9 million, an increase of $82.2 million, or 21.2%, from $388.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. this increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for communications. overall unit shipments increased by 9% due to higher market demand with current customers and design wins with new customers, and average sales prices increased by 12%.
revenue from the consumer market for the year ended december 31, 2017 increased $36.0 million, or 23.4%, from the same period in 2016. this increase was primarily driven by higher demand in gaming and home appliance products. revenue from the computing and storage market increased $20.2 million, or 25.1%, from the same period in 2016. this increase was primarily driven by strength in the solid-state drive storage, cloud computing and high-performance notebook markets. revenue from the industrial market increased $7.2 million, or 12.9%, from the same period in 2016. this increase was primarily driven by higher sales in power source products. revenue from the automotive market increased $19.9 million, or 58.7%, from the same period in 2016. this increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications. revenue from the communications market decreased $1.1 million, or 1.7%, from the same period in 2016. this decrease was primarily driven by lower demand in wireless applications.
revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $388.7 million, an increase of $55.6 million, or 16.7%, from $333.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. this increase was driven by higher sales in all of our end markets except for communications. overall unit shipments increased by 19% due to higher market demand with current customers and design wins with new customers, which was partially offset by a 2% decrease in average sales prices.
revenue from the consumer market for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased $8.6 million, or 6.0%, from the same period in 2015. this increase was primarily driven by higher demand in battery management systems, home appliances and other high value consumer products. revenue from the computing and storage market increased $24.0 million, or 42.4%, from the same period in 2015. this increase was primarily driven by strength in the cloud computing, high-performance notebook and solid-state drive storage markets. revenue from the industrial market increased $9.8 million, or 21.2%, from the same period in 2015. this increase was primarily driven by higher sales in security, smart meter and power source products. revenue from the automotive market increased $13.5 million, or 66.4%, from the same period in 2015. this increase was primarily driven by higher sales of products for infotainment, safety and connectivity applications. revenue from the communications market was essentially flat compared to the same period in 2015.
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred to manufacture, assemble and test our products, as well as warranty costs, inventory-related and other overhead costs, and stock-based compensation expenses. in addition, cost of revenue includes amortization for acquisition-related intangible assets.

cost of revenue was $212.6 million, or 45.2% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2017, and $177.8 million, or 45.7% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2016. the $34.8 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 9% increase in overall unit shipments, coupled with a 13% increase in the average direct cost of units shipped. the increase in cost of revenue was also driven by a $3.5 million increase in inventory write-downs and warranty expenses.
gross margin was 54.8% for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared with 54.3% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher inventory write-downs.
cost of revenue was $177.8 million, or 45.7% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2016, and $152.9 million, or 45.9% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2015. the $24.9 million increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to a 19% increase in overall unit shipments, which was partially offset by a 2% decrease in the average direct cost of units shipped. the increase in cost of revenue was also driven by a $1.0 million increase in warranty expenses and inventory write-downs.
gross margin was 54.3% for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with 54.1% for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by the impact of certain manufacturing cost variances.
research and development research and development ("r&d") expenses primarily consist of salary and benefit expenses, bonuses, stock-based compensation and deferred compensation expenses for design and product engineers, expenses related to new product development and supplies, and facility costs.
year ended december 31,                                            change
r&d expenses were $82.4 million, or 17.5% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2017, and $73.6 million, or 18.9% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2016. the $8.8 million increase in r&d expenses was primarily due to an increase of $3.8 million in compensation expenses, which include salary, benefits and bonuses, an increase of $1.9 million in laboratory supplies, an increase of $1.6 million in new product development expenses, an increase of $0.8 million in stock-based compensation expenses mainly associated with the performance-based equity awards, and an increase of $0.7 million in expenses related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan liabilities. our r&d headcount was 629 employees as of december 31, 2017, compared with 578 employees as of december 31, 2016.
r&d expenses were $73.6 million, or 18.9% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2016, and $65.8 million, or 19.8% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2015. the $7.8 million increase in r&d expenses was primarily due to an increase of $2.9 million in stock-based compensation expenses mainly associated with the performance and market-based equity awards, an increase of $2.2 million in cash compensation expenses, which include salary, benefits and bonuses, an increase of $1.6 million in new product development expenses, and an increase of $0.5 million in expenses related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan liabilities. our r&d headcount was 578 employees as of december 31, 2016, compared with 506 employees as of december 31, 2015.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expenses primarily include salary and benefit expenses, bonuses, stock-based compensation and deferred compensation expenses for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales commissions, travel expenses, facilities costs, and professional service fees.
year ended december 31,                                            change
sg&a expenses were $97.3 million, or 20.7% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2017, and $83.0 million, or 21.4% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2016. the $14.3 million increase in sg&a expenses was primarily due to an increase of $3.9 million in stock-based compensation expenses mainly associated with the performance-based equity awards, an increase of $3.7 million in compensation expenses, which include salary, benefits and bonuses, an increase of $1.3 million in depreciation expense, an increase of $1.0 million in expenses related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan liabilities, and an increase of $0.4 million in commission expenses due to higher revenue. in addition, contributing to the increase in sg&a expenses in 2017 was a stock-based compensation credit of $2.9 million which reduced sg&a expenses in 2016 due to the retirement of our then chief financial officer. as the service or performance conditions for her outstanding restricted stock units had not been satisfied at the time of her departure, we reversed previously accrued stock-based compensation expenses of $2.9 million associated with the unvested restricted stock units and the credit was reflected in sg&a expenses for year ended december 31, 2016.  our sg&a headcount was 389 employees as of december 31, 2017, compared with 355 employees as of december 31, 2016.
sg&a expenses were $83.0 million, or 21.4% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2016, and $72.3 million, or 21.7% of revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2015. the $10.7 million increase in sg&a expenses was primarily due to an increase of $3.0 million in stock-based compensation expenses mainly associated with the performance and market-based equity awards, an increase of $2.9 million in cash compensation expenses, which include salary, benefits and bonuses, an increase of $2.1 million in commission expenses due to higher revenue, and an increase of $0.8 million in expenses related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan liabilities. in addition, contributing to the increase in sg&a expenses in 2016 was a credit of $2.5 million related to the release of a contingent consideration liability which reduced sg&a expenses in 2015 (see below). these increases were partially offset by the stock-based compensation credit of $2.9 million recorded in 2016 due to the retirement of our then chief financial officer. our sg&a headcount was 355 employees as of december 31, 2016, compared with 306 employees as of december 31, 2015.
our acquisition of sensima technology sa ("sensima") in july 2014 included a contingent consideration arrangement which required us to pay up to an additional $8.9 million to former sensima shareholders if sensima achieved a new product introduction as well as certain product revenue and direct margin targets in 2016. the fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date was $2.5 million, which was estimated based on a probability-weighted analysis of possible future revenue outcomes. the fair value of the contingent consideration was initially recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was remeasured at the end of each reporting period, with any changes in fair value recorded in operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. as part of the quarterly assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015, management reviewed the sales forecast for the products and determined that the projected product revenue in 2016 would likely not meet the minimum target required to earn the contingent consideration, primarily because the product adoption process by customers would take longer than we had originally anticipated. accordingly, the fair value of the contingent consideration was deemed to be $0 as of december 31, 2015. the company released the liability of $2.5 million and recorded the credit in sg&a expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015.
litigation expense (benefit), net litigation expense was $1.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared with a litigation benefit, net, of $0.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase in litigation expense was primarily due to an ongoing litigation. in addition, we recognized $0.7 million of benefit in connection with two litigation settlements for the year ended december 31, 2016.
litigation benefit, net, was $0.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with litigation expense of $1.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the net litigation benefit in 2016 was attributable to the recognition of $0.7 million of benefit in connection with two litigation settlements, partially offset by $0.5 million of litigation expenses.
interest and other income, net interest and other income, net, was $5.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared with $2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.9 million in interest income as a result of higher investment balances and higher yields, and an increase of $1.3 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in amortization of premium on available-for-sale investments and an increase of $0.6 million in foreign currency exchange loss.
interest and other income, net, was $2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared with $1.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.6 million in income related to changes in the value of the deferred compensation plan investments and an increase of $0.9 million in interest income as a result of higher yields and higher investment balances, partially offset by an increase of $0.6 million in amortization of premium on available-for-sale investments and a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign currency exchange gains.
income tax provision the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $17.7 million, or 21.4% of pre-tax income. the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in bermuda and china was taxed at lower rates, and because of the stock-based compensation deductions. in addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by the effects of the 2017 tax act and the release of the u.s. valuation allowance as discussed in details below.
2017 u.s. tax reform:
on december 22, 2017, the securities and exchange commission issued sab 118, which addresses the application of asc 740 in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 tax act. in accordance with sab 118, for matters that have not been completed, we would recognize provisional amounts to the extent that they are reasonably estimable. if a reasonable estimate cannot be determined, we would not be required to report provisional amounts and would continue to apply asc 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the 2017 tax act.
as of december 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the 2017 tax act and recorded certain provisional amounts, as discussed below, based on reasonable estimates for the year ended december 31, 2017. the provisional amounts are subject to revisions, possibly materially, as we perform further analysis of the 2017 tax act, collect and prepare necessary financial data, continue to assess our tax positions, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the u.s. treasury department, irs, fasb, and other standard-setting and regulatory bodies. any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to the income tax provision in the period when the analysis is complete. we expect to complete the analysis within the one-year measurement period ending december 21, 2018, pursuant to sab 118.
corporate tax rate and remeasurement of deferred taxes the 2017 tax act reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective january 1, 2018. because asc 740 requires the effect of a change in tax laws to be recognized as of the date of enactment, we remeasured our deferred tax balance as of december 22, 2017 and recorded a provisional amount of $9.8 million to the income tax provision as a result of the remeasurement for the year ended december 31, 2017.
deemed repatriation transition tax the 2017 tax act mandates a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax of post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings and profits ("e&p") on which u.s. income taxes were previously deferred. the rate applied varies depending on whether the e&p is held in liquid or non-liquid assets. a proportional deduction on the deemed repatriation results in a transition tax of 15.5% for cash and liquid assets and 8% for non-liquid assets. the transition tax is assessed regardless of whether we repatriate the earnings. the transition tax is determined on the greater of e&p as of two measurement dates (november 2, 2017 or december 31, 2017). the amount of cash and liquid assets is determined based on the greater of the amounts calculated using two alternative measurement periods.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional amount of $41.9 million related to the transition tax expense. after the utilization of r&d tax credits of $18.0 million, the transition tax payable is $23.9 million. as permitted by the 2017 tax act, we have elected to pay the transition tax in installments over eight years. as a result, $1.9 million was recorded in current accrued liabilities and $22.0 million was recorded in long-term income tax liabilities as of december 31, 2017.
undistributed earnings of subsidiaries we previously considered the earnings in our non-u.s. subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no deferred income taxes. prior to the transition tax, we had an excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries including undistributed foreign earnings of $390.2 million. while the transition tax resulted in the reduction of the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries and subjected a provisional amount of $119.7 million of undistributed foreign earnings to tax, an actual repatriation from our non-u.s. subsidiaries could be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state taxes.
we have analyzed our global working capital and cash requirements, and have determined that we plan to repatriate cash from our bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund our future u.s. based expenditures and dividends. for the other foreign subsidiaries, we expect to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings to fund foreign operations and their research and development. for those undistributed foreign earnings from which we were not able to make a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of such repatriation, we have not recorded any deferred taxes or accrued for any withholding taxes or state taxes as of december 31, 2017. we will record the tax effects of any change in our prior assertion with respect to those undistributed foreign earnings in the period that we are first able to make a reasonable estimate, no later than the end of the measurement period under sab 118.
global intangible low-taxed income the 2017 tax act subjects a u.s. parent shareholder to taxation of its global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti"), effective january 1, 2018. the gilti inclusions will impact companies that have foreign earnings generated without a large aggregate foreign fixed asset base and whose earnings are being taxed at a low tax rate. gilti is calculated based on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. the income inclusion under gilti is eligible for a deduction that is intended to lower the effective tax rate to 10.5% for taxable years 2018 to 2025, and rise to 13.125% for taxable years after 2025. the enactment of the gilti tax will result in additional subpart f income recognition for us in 2018 and onwards.
executive compensation deductions the 2017 tax act retains the $1 million limitation on deductible compensation to covered employees, which include the chief executive officer and four other highest paid officers, under irc section 162(m). however, it eliminates the exception for performance-based cash or stock compensation and expands the definition of covered employees to include the chief financial officer. accordingly, beginning january 1, 2018, the deductible compensation to covered employees will generally be subject to the $1 million limitation.
management periodically evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence. the realizability of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax attributes to fully utilize these assets.  we maintained a full valuation allowance on our u.s. deferred tax assets as of the third quarter of 2017.  in the fourth quarter of 2017, we assessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets would be realizable, due principally to the enactment of the 2017 tax act. in accordance with asc 740, management considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance for deferred tax asset was needed. our conclusion was primarily driven by the following positive evidence:
●   we forecast taxable income in the u.s. in future periods. the enactment of gilti will result in additional subpart f income each year.
●   executive performance-based equity awards are now subject to the section 162(m) deduction limitation.
●   we have a history of utilizing all federal tax attributes before expiration.
as a result, we released $21.6 million of valuation allowance on federal deferred tax assets, which was recorded as a benefit in the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2017. we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets in california, primarily due to a low apportionment factor and the amount of r&d tax credits generated is greater than the amount utilized.
the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $4.5 million, or 7.9% of pre-tax income. the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in bermuda and china was taxed at lower rates. in addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by changes in valuation allowance and the stock-based compensation deductions.
the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $7.3 million, or 17.2% of pre-tax income. we recorded a one-time net charge of $2.7 million to the income tax provision related to the resolution of the income tax audits in the second quarter of 2015. in addition to the impact of this charge, the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily because foreign income generated by our subsidiaries in bermuda and china was taxed at lower rates and from the release of an income tax reserve where the statute of limitations expired. in addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by changes in valuation allowance.

as of december 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $82.8 million and short-term investments of $216.3 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $112.7 million and short-term investments of $155.5 million as of december 31, 2016. as of december 31, 2017, $66.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $113.1 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries. after the enactment of the 2017 tax act, we currently plan to repatriate cash from our bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund our future expenditures in the u.s. and continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from other foreign subsidiaries. see the "income tax provision" section for further discussion.
the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets, reduced by accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits, and other accrued liabilities. as of december 31, 2017, we had working capital of $383.3 million, compared with working capital of $330.1 million as of december 31, 2016. the $53.2 million increase in working capital was due to a $66.2 million increase in current assets, partially offset by a $13.0 million increase in current liabilities. the increase in current assets was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventories and prepaid expenses, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued compensation and related benefits and other accrued liabilities.
summary of cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activities:

effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents                 1,620                     (2,090    )                (1,293   )
for the year ended december 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $133.8 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred taxes, and a net increase of $15.7 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. the increase in deferred taxes was primarily due to the release of the u.s. valuation allowance, partially offset by the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance as a result of the 2017 tax act, in the fourth quarter of 2017. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by higher sales. the increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth. the increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by increased inventory and capital asset purchases to meet future demand. the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan and warranty expenses. the increase in income tax liabilities was primarily driven by the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax liability recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $107.8 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, and a net decrease of $2.9 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. the increase in other assets was primarily due to a prepaid wafer purchase agreement we funded during the year. the increase in inventories was primarily driven by increased purchases to meet current demand and future growth. the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $69.7 million, primarily due to our net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, a change in fair value of contingent consideration and a net decrease of $12.6 million from the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. the increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by increased sales. the increase in inventories was primarily driven by increased purchases to meet current demand and future growth. the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in employee contributions to the deferred compensation plan.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $134.1 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $65.8 million, net purchases of short-term investments of $63.0 million, and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $5.3 million. for the year ended december 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $55.7 million, primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $37.1 million, net purchases of investments of $13.6 million, and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $5.0 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $57.2 million, primarily due to net purchases of investments of $33.5 million, purchases of property and equipment of $16.0 million, and net contributions to the deferred compensation plan of $8.0 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we funded the purchases of land in kirkland, washington, office space in shanghai and hangzhou, china, and land and office space in taipei, taiwan for $53.8 million. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we funded the purchases of a previously leased manufacturing facility in chengdu, china, office space in shenzhen, china, and land and office space in taipei, taiwan for $17.5 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we spent $5.4 million to purchase office space in shanghai, china.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $31.3 million, primarily reflecting $33.9 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus, partially offset by $2.9 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. for the year ended december 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $28.1 million, primarily reflecting $33.1 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus, partially offset by $3.8 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan. for the year ended december 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $46.7 million, primarily reflecting $32.3 million used in repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and $30.0 million used to pay dividends to our stockholders and dividend equivalents to our employees who hold rsus, partially offset by $10.0 million of cash proceeds from stock option exercises and issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.
in july 2013, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to $100 million in the aggregate of our common stock. the program expired on december 31, 2015. in february 2016, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorized us to repurchase up to $50 million in the aggregate of our common stock. the program expired on december 31, 2017. for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not repurchase any shares. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we repurchased a total of 0.6 million shares for $32.3 million, at an average price of $50.05 per share.
in june 2014, our board of directors approved a dividend program pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. in addition, outstanding rsu awards contain rights to receive dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who hold rsus to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. the dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying rsus vest. dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying rsus are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their service requirement and the awards do not vest. for the year ended december 31, 2017, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $33.9 million. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $33.1 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we paid dividends and dividend equivalents totaling $30.0 million.
in february 2018, our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends from $0.20 per share to $0.30 per share, effective for the first quarter of 2018.
we anticipate that cash used for future dividends and dividend equivalent payments, as well as payments for the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax, will come from our current domestic cash and cash generated from ongoing u.s. operations. as a result of the 2017 tax act, we also plan to repatriate cash from our bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund these and other future expenditures in the u.s. and continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from other foreign subsidiaries. see the "income tax provision" section for further discussion.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and short-term investments, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months.
in the future, in order to strengthen our financial position, respond to changes in our circumstance or unforeseen events or conditions, or fund our growth, we may need to discontinue paying dividends and dividend equivalents, and may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following: issuing equity securities, issuing debt or convertible debt securities, incurring indebtedness secured by our assets, or selling certain product lines and/or portions of our business. accordingly, we cannot ensure that we will continue to pay dividends and dividend equivalents in the future, and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
from time to time, we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines, technologies, businesses and companies, and we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates. any such transactions could involve the issuance of a significant number of new equity securities, assumptions of debt, and/or payment of cash consideration. we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisitions, through either the issuance of equity and debt securities or incurring indebtedness secured by our assets. if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution.
outstanding purchase commitments (1)          52,586                49,736                   1,000                   1,000           850
transition tax liability (2)                  23,934                1,915                    3,829                   3,829                  14,361
(1)   outstanding purchase commitments primarily consist of wafer and other inventory purchases, assembly services and license arrangements.
(2)   the transition tax liability represents a one-time, mandatory deemed repatriation tax imposed on previously deferred foreign earnings under the 2017 tax act. as permitted by the 2017 tax act, we elected to pay the tax liability in installment over eight years: 8% in 2018, 8% in 2019, 8% in 2020, 8% in 2021, 8% in 2022, 15% in 2023, 20% in 2024, and 25% in 2025. see the "income tax provision" section for further discussion.
(3)   other long-term obligations include long-term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, which primarily consist of the deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued dividend equivalents. because of the uncertainty as to the timing of distributions related to a portion of the deferred compensation plan liabilities, we have excluded estimated obligations of $1.1 million from the table above. in addition, because of the uncertainty as to the timing of payments related to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, we have excluded estimated obligations of $9.6 million from the table above.
off balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4) of the securities and exchange commission's regulation s-k.

item 1a. risk factors.
investing in our securities involves risk. in addition to the other information contained in this report, you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities.
risks related to our business there has been a shift in consumer behavior as a result of technological innovations and changes in the distribution of content, which may affect our viewership and the profitability of our business in unpredictable ways.
technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly. consumer behavior related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation affect our economic model and viewership in ways that are not entirely predictable.
consumers are increasingly viewing content on a time-delayed or on-demand basis from traditional distributors and from connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens, such as televisions, tablets, mobile phones and other devices. additionally, devices that allow users to view television programs on a time-shifted basis and technologies that enable users to fast-forward or skip programming, including commercials, such as dvrs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make portable copies of content may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues. there is increased demand for short-form, user-generated and interactive content, which have different economic models than our traditional content offerings. likewise, distributors are offering smaller programming packages known as "skinny bundles," which are delivered at a lower cost than traditional offerings and sometimes allow consumers to create a customized package of networks, that are gaining popularity among consumers. if our networks are not included in these packages or consumers favor alternative offerings, we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately the demand for our programming, which could lead to lower distribution and advertising revenues. we have also seen declines in subscribers to the traditional cable bundle. in 2017, total u.s. networks portfolio subscribers declined 5% while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3% for the same period. each distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us, so the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not completely predictable. distribution windows are also evolving, potentially affecting revenues from other windows. if we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our target audiences, our business could be adversely affected.
consolidation among cable and satellite providers, both domestically and internationally, could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.
consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers, including us. in the u.s., approximately 90% of our distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors. for the international networks segment, approximately 42% of distribution revenue comes from the 10 largest distributors. we currently have agreements in place with the major cable and satellite operators in u.s. networks and international networks which expire at various times through 2021. some of our largest distributors have combined, and as a result, have gained, or may gain, market power, which could affect our ability to maximize the value of our content through those platforms. in addition, many of the countries and territories in which we distribute our networks also have a small number of dominant distributors. continued consolidation within the industry could reduce the number of distributors to carry our programming, subject our affiliate fee revenue to greater volume discounts, and further increase the negotiating leverage of the cable and satellite television system operators which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
the success of our business depends on the acceptance of our entertainment content by our u.s. and foreign viewers, which may be unpredictable and volatile.
the production and distribution of entertainment content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general, in special interest groups, in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces. as the home of the olympic games in europe until 2024, we have been developing and innovating new forms of content in connection with the olympic games. our success with the olympics depends on audience acceptance of this content. if viewers do not find our olympic games content acceptable, we could see low viewership, which could lead to low distribution and advertising revenues.
the commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace. other factors, including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions, piracy, and growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect the audience for our content. audience sizes for our media networks are critical factors affecting both the volume and pricing of advertising revenue that we receive, and the extent of distribution and the license fees we receive under agreements with our distributors. consequently, reduced public acceptance of our entertainment content may decrease our audience share and adversely affect our results of operations.
as a company that has operations in the united kingdom, the vote by the united kingdom to leave the e.u. could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial position.
on june 23, 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union ("e.u."), commonly referred to as "brexit." as a result of the referendum, the british government has begun negotiating the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the e.u. the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the u.k. makes to retain access to the e.u. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose subscribers, distributors and employees. if the u.k. loses access to the single e.u. market and the global trade deals negotiated by the e.u., it could have a detrimental impact on our u.k. growth. such a decline could also make
our doing business in europe more difficult, which could delay and reduce the scope our distribution and licensing agreements. without access to the single e.u. market, it may be more challenging and costly to obtain intellectual property rights for our content within the u.k. or distribute our services in europe. in addition, brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the u.k. determines which e.u. laws to replace and replicate. if there are changes to u.k. immigration policy as a result of brexit, this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the e.u. member states for work-related matters.
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions.
we have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies. as a result, we have exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions and make investments denominated in multiple currencies. the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the u.s. dollar. our consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the u.s. from local currencies into u.s. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. this increased exposure could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances. there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain unchanged in any period or for any specific market.
our businesses operate in highly competitive industries.
the entertainment and media programming industries in which we operate are highly competitive. we compete with other programming networks for distribution, viewers and advertising. we also compete for viewers with other forms of media entertainment, such as home video, movies, periodicals, on-line and mobile activities. in particular, websites and search engines have seen significant advertising growth, a portion of which has moved from traditional cable network and satellite advertisers. businesses, including ours, that offer multiple services, or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content, may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations. if our distributors have to pay higher rates to holders of sports broadcasting rights, it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for distribution of our networks. our commerce business competes against a wide range of competitive retailers selling similar products. the ability of our businesses to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including our ability to consistently supply high quality and popular content, access our niche viewership with appealing category-specific content, adapt to new technologies and distribution platforms and achieve widespread distribution. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that increasing competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
failure to renew, renewal with less favorable terms, or termination of our affiliation agreements may cause a decline in our revenue.
because our networks are licensed on a wholesale basis to distributors, such as cable and satellite operators, which in turn distribute them to consumers, we are dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with these operators. these affiliation agreements generally provide for the level of carriage our networks will receive, such as channel placement and programming package inclusion (widely distributed, broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed, specialized programming packages) and for payment of a license fee to us based on the number of subscribers that receive our networks. while the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue, these per subscriber payments also represent a significant portion of our revenue. our affiliation agreements generally have a limited term which varies by market and distributor, and there can be no assurance that these affiliation agreements will be renewed in the future, or renewed on terms that are favorable to us. a reduction in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks, could adversely affect our distribution revenue. such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue. in addition, our affiliation agreements are complex and individually negotiated. if we were to disagree with one of our counterparties on the interpretation of an affiliation agreement, our relationship with that counterparty could be damaged and our business could be negatively affected.
some of our distribution agreements contain "most favored nation" clauses. these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms, we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors. we have entered into a number of distribution agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements. while we believe that we have appropriately complied with the most favored nation clauses included in our distribution agreements, these agreements are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that, if correct, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
we face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our programming services, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.
our on-line, mobile and app offerings, as well as our internal systems, involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming. our systems may be breached due to employee error, malicious code, hacking and phishing attacks, or otherwise. additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our proprietary information, which may include user data, a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services, damage to our brands and reputation, a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services, and significant legal and financial exposure, each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.
our equity method and cost method investments' financial performance may differ from current estimates.
we have equity investments in several entities and the accounting treatment applied for these investments varies depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our percentage ownership and the level of influence or control we have over the relevant entity. any losses experienced by these entities could adversely impact our results of operations and the value of our investment. in addition, if these entities were to fail and cease operations, we may lose the entire value of our investment and the stream of any shared profits. some of our ventures may require additional uncommitted funding. we also have significant investments in entities that we have accounted for using the cost method. if these entities experience significant losses or were to fail and cease operations, our investments could be subject to impairment and the loss of a part or all of our investment value.
risks related to the scripps networks acquisition we may not be able to successfully integrate the scripps networks business with our own, realize the anticipated benefits of the scripps networks acquisition or manage our expanded operations, any of which would adversely affect our results of operations.
we have devoted, and expect to continue to devote, significant management attention and resources to integrating our organization, procedures, and operations with those of scripps networks. such integration efforts are costly due to the large number of processes, policies, procedures, locations, operations, technologies and systems to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, service, operations, payroll, pricing, marketing and employee benefits. integration expenses could, particularly in the short term, exceed the cost synergies we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale, which could result in significant charges to earnings that we cannot currently quantify. potential difficulties that we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:
•   our inability to successfully combine our business with scripps networks in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the full synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the merger; and
•   complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating products, services, complex and different information technology systems, control and compliance processes, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a cohesive manner.
following the merger, the size and complexity of the business of the combined company will increase significantly. our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits anticipated from the merger.
dcl was not obligated to place in escrow the net proceeds of its senior notes that were issued in september 2017, partially to fund the scripps networks acquisition (the "senior notes"), and, as a result, we may not be able to redeem the senior notes upon a special mandatory redemption.
under the terms of the senior notes, we are obligated to redeem the senior notes at a redemption price of 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if the scripps acquisition does not close by august 18, 2018 (a "special mandatory redemption").  we were not obligated to place the net proceeds of the offering of the senior notes in escrow prior to the completion of the scripps networks acquisition or to provide a security interest in those proceeds, and the indenture governing the senior notes imposes no other restrictions on our use of these proceeds during that time. accordingly, the source of funds for any redemption of the $500 million principal amount of 2.200% senior notes due 2019, $1.20 billion principal amount of 2.950% senior notes due 2023, $1.70 billion principal amount of 3.950% senior notes due 2028, $1.25 billion principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due
2037 and $1.25 billion principal amount of 5.200% senior notes due 2047 or £400 million principal amount of 2.500% senior notes due 2024 upon a special mandatory redemption would be the proceeds that we have voluntarily retained or other sources of liquidity, including available cash, borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. we may not be able to satisfy our obligation to redeem these senior notes upon a special mandatory redemption, because we may not have sufficient financial resources to pay the aggregate redemption price on such senior notes. our failure to redeem these senior notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under the indenture, which could result in defaults under our and our subsidiaries' other debt agreements and have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the senior notes. in addition, our ability to redeem the senior notes for cash may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness outstanding at the time.
general risks theft of our content, including digital copyright theft and other unauthorized exhibitions of our content, may decrease revenue received from our programming and adversely affect our businesses and profitability.
the success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain the intellectual property rights to our entertainment content. we are fundamentally a content company, and piracy of our brands, television networks, digital content and other intellectual property has the potential to significantly and adversely affect us. piracy is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack copyright and other protections similar to existing law in the u.s. it is also made easier by technological advances allowing the conversion of content into digital formats, which facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners' ability to protect and exploit their property. the proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have an adverse effect on our business and profitability because it reduces the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content. litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
we have operations through which we distribute programming outside the united states. as a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. these risks include:
•   laws and policies affecting trade and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;
•   changes in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on content, imposition of local content quotas and restrictions on foreign ownership;
•   differing degrees of protection for intellectual property and varying attitudes towards the piracy of intellectual property;
•   significant fluctuations in foreign currency value;
•   currency exchange controls;
•   the instability of foreign economies and governments;
•   anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations and changes in these laws and regulations;
•   foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulation and changes in these laws; and
•   shifting consumer preferences regarding the viewing of video programming.
events or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from non-u.s. sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.
furthermore, some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the u.s. we also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes, including the imposition of new restrictions, in the existing economic or political environment in the regions where we do business. acts of terrorism, hostilities, or financial, political, economic or other uncertainties could lead to a reduction in revenue or loss of investment, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our business.
our business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruptions to financial markets. we derive substantial revenues from advertisers, and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns. financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the u.s. and other countries where our networks are
decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the u.s. and other countries where our networks are distributed may affect cable television and other video service subscriptions, in particular with respect to digital service tiers on which certain of our programming networks are carried. this could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from multi-channel video programming distributors, which could have a negative impact on our viewing subscribers and affiliation fee revenues. similarly, a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative impact on the number of viewers actually watching the programs on our programming networks, which could also impact the rates we are able to charge advertisers.
economic conditions affect a number of aspects of our businesses worldwide and impact the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks and might reduce their spending on advertising. economic conditions can also negatively affect the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. the general worsening of current global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the worsening of economic conditions in certain parts of the world, specifically, could impact the expansion and success of our businesses in such areas.
domestic and foreign laws and regulations could adversely impact our operation results.
programming services like ours, and the distributors of our services, including cable operators, satellite operators and other multi-channel video programming distributors, are regulated by u.s. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the fcc, as well as by state and local governments, in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business. see the discussion under "business - regulatory matters" above. the u.s. congress, the fcc and the courts currently have under consideration, and may adopt or interpret in the future, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations of our u.s. media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate.
similarly, the foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have, in varying degrees, laws and regulations governing our businesses. programming businesses are subject to regulation on a country-by-country basis. changes in regulations imposed by foreign governments could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to expand our operations beyond their current scope.
financial markets are subject to volatility and disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain or increase the cost of financing our operations and our ability to meet our other obligations.
increased volatility and disruptions in the u.s. and global financial and equity markets may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing. our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a low rating could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing. unforeseeable changes in foreign currencies could negatively impact our results of operations and calculations of interest coverage and leverage ratios.
acquisitions and other strategic transactions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction.
from time to time we make acquisitions, investments and enter into other strategic transactions, including our planned transaction with scripps networks. in connection with such acquisitions and strategic transactions, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, subscribers, affiliates and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions such as the scripps networks transaction. additionally, regulatory agencies, such as the fcc or doj may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic transactions. the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business.
our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm our operating results.
our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. we have acquired, and have made strategic investments in, a number of companies (including through joint ventures) in the past, and we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future. such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, use of our cash resources, and incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. any acquisitions and strategic investments that we are able to identify and complete may be accompanied by a number of risks, including:
•   the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations;
•   the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;
•   the incurrence of additional operating losses and operating expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;
•   the difficulty of integrating acquired technology and rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;
•   the failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;
•   the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;
•   the potential for patent and trademark infringement and data privacy and security claims against the acquired companies, or companies in which we have invested;
•   litigation or other claims in connection with acquisitions, acquired companies, or companies in which we have invested;
•   the impairment or loss of relationships with customers and partners of the companies we acquired or in which we invested or with our customers and partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations;
•   the impairment of relationships with, or failure to retain, employees of acquired companies or our existing employees as a result of integration of new personnel;
•   our lack of, or limitations on our, control over the operations of our joint venture companies;
•   the difficulty of integrating operations, systems, and controls as a result of cultural, regulatory, systems, and operational differences;
•   in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and
•   the impact of known potential liabilities or liabilities that may be unknown, including as a result of inadequate internal controls, associated with the companies we acquired or in which we invested.
our failure to be successful in addressing these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.
the loss of key personnel or talent could disrupt our business and adversely affect our revenue.
our business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities. our success after the scripps networks acquisition will depend in part upon our ability to retain key employees. prior to and following the completion of the merger, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with discovery and choose to pursue other opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on discovery after the transaction. if key employees depart, the integration of scripps networks with discovery may be more difficult and our business following the completion of the merger may be adversely affected. additionally, we employ or contract with entertainment personalities who may have loyal audiences. these individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content. there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences. if we fail to retain key individuals or if our entertainment personalities lose their current audience base, our operations could be adversely affected.
newly-enacted us tax reform could adversely impact our international business and results of operations.
recently enacted us tax reform could adversely impact our business and results of operations. on december 22, 2017, president trump signed the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja"), which includes a broad range of tax reform regulations affecting businesses, including corporate tax rates, business deductions, and international tax provisions. some of the changes, like the new tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") or the base erosion and anti-abuse tax ("beat"), could have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate, the amount of our consolidated net taxable income subject to income taxes, and our overall tax liability, and could reduce our net income and our earnings per share, as well as our consolidated cash flows and liquidity, even if the changes include a reduction in the rate at which corporate taxable income is taxed. in addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. our income taxes could also be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.
risks related to our debt we have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant amounts of additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business.
as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately $14.8 billion of consolidated debt, including capital leases. our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on, or other amounts associated with our indebtedness. in addition, we have the ability to draw down our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility in the ordinary course, which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness. we are also permitted, subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness, to obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs. this would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations, including:
•   impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt in the event that an uncured default occurs;
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and market conditions;
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing;
•   requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes;
•   requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete; and
•   placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.
our ability to incur debt and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility.
the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants, as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests. these covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets. these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors, who may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions. further, these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities.
risks related to corporate structure as a holding company, we could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments.
our ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash. we are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments, availability under our credit facility or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. the ability of our operating subsidiaries, including discovery communications, llc, to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions, including restrictions under our credit facility, to which they may be or may become subject. under the tcja, we are subject to u.s. taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations. however, we intent to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations.
we have directors in common with those of liberty media corporation ("liberty media"), liberty global plc ("liberty global"), liberty interactive corporation ("liberty interactive") and liberty broadband corporation ("liberty broadband"), which may result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts.
liberty media, liberty global, liberty interactive and liberty broadband (together, the "liberty entities") own interests in
various u.s. and international companies, such as charter communications, inc. ("charter"), that have subsidiaries that own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer. we have no rights in respect of u.s. or international content opportunities developed by or presented to the subsidiaries of any liberty entities, and the pursuit of these opportunities by such subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders. because we and the liberty entities have overlapping directors, the pursuit of business opportunities may serve to intensify the conflicts of interest or appearance of conflicts of interest faced by the respective management teams. our charter provides that none of our directors or officers will be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including any liberty entities), for which such individual serves as a director or officer, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such individual solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of us or any of our subsidiaries and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which we or any of our subsidiaries is then directly engaged.
we have directors that are also related persons of advance/newhouse and that overlap with those of the liberty entities, which may lead to conflicting interests for those tasked with the fiduciary duties of our board.
our eleven-person board of directors includes three designees of advance/newhouse, including robert j. miron, who was the chairman of advance/newhouse until december 31, 2010, and steven a. miron, the chief executive officer of advance/newhouse. in addition, our board of directors includes two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty media, three persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty global, one person who is currently a member of the board of directors of liberty interactive, two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of liberty broadband and two persons who are currently members of the board of directors of charter, of which liberty broadband owns an equity interest. john c. malone is the chairman of the boards of all of the liberty entities and is a member of the board of directors of charter. the parent company of advance/newhouse and the liberty entities own interests in a range of media, communications and entertainment businesses.
advance/newhouse will elect three directors annually for so long as it owns a specified minimum amount of our series a-1 convertible preferred stock. the advance/newhouse series a-1 convertible preferred stock, which votes with our common stock on all matters other than the election of directors, represents approximately 24% of the voting power of our outstanding shares. the series a-1 convertible preferred stock also grants advance/newhouse consent rights over a range of our corporate actions, including fundamental changes to our business, the issuance of additional capital stock, mergers and business combinations and certain acquisitions and dispositions.
none of the liberty entities own any interest in us. mr. malone beneficially owns stock of liberty media representing approximately 47% of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock, owns shares representing approximately 26% of the aggregate voting power of liberty global, shares representing approximately 39% of the aggregate voting power of liberty interactive, shares representing approximately 46% of the aggregate voting power of liberty broadband and shares representing approximately 21% of the aggregate voting power (other than with respect to the election of the common stock directors) of our outstanding stock. mr. malone controls approximately 28% of our aggregate voting power relating to the election of our eight common stock directors, assuming that the preferred stock owned by advance/newhouse has not been converted into shares of our common stock. our directors who are also directors of the liberty entities own stock and stock incentives of the liberty entities and own our stock and stock incentives.
these ownership interests and/or business positions could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us, advance/newhouse and/or the liberty entities. for example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we, on the one hand, or advance/newhouse and/or one or more of the liberty entities, on the other hand, consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other.
the members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders. likewise, those persons who serve in similar capacities at advance/newhouse or a liberty entity have fiduciary duties to those companies. therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies, and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest.
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. these provisions include the following:
•   authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a series b that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a series a-1 that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a series c that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;
•   authorizing the series a-1 convertible preferred stock with special voting rights, which prohibits us from taking any of the following actions, among others, without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such stock:
•   engaging in a merger, consolidation or other business combination with any other entity; and
•   classifying our common stock directors with staggered three-year terms and having three directors elected by the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;
•   limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;
•   prohibiting stockholder action by written consent (subject to certain exceptions), thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;
•   establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;
•   requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 80% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our charter;
•   requiring the consent of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding series b common stock (voting as a separate class) to certain share distributions and other corporate actions in which the voting power of the series b common stock would be diluted by, for example, issuing shares having multiple votes per share as a dividend to holders of series a common stock; and
•   the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.
we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire us to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover. while the plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of us, the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of us.
principles of delaware law and the provisions of our charter may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. under delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. as a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is adverse to the holders of one series of common stock. under the principles of delaware law referred to above, stockholders may not be able to challenge these decisions if our board of directors is disinterested and adequately informed with respect to these decisions and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that it is acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders.
if advance/newhouse were to exercise its registration rights, it may cause a significant decline in our stock price, even if our business is doing well.
advance/newhouse has been granted registration rights covering all of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock held by advance/newhouse. advance/newhouse's series a-1 convertible preferred stock is currently convertible into nine share of our series a common stock and advance/newhouse's series c-1 convertible preferred stock is convertible into 19.3648 shares of our series c common stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. the registration rights, which are immediately exercisable, are transferable with the sale or transfer by advance/newhouse of blocks of shares representing 10% or more of the preferred stock it holds. the exercise of the registration rights, and subsequent sale of
possibly large amounts of our common stock in the public market, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
john c. malone and advance/newhouse each have significant voting power with respect to corporate matters considered by our stockholders.
for corporate matters other than the election of directors, mr. malone and advance/newhouse each beneficially own shares of our stock representing approximately 21% and 24%, respectively, of the aggregate voting power represented by our outstanding stock. with respect to the election of directors, mr. malone controls approximately 28% of the aggregate voting power relating to the election of the eight common stock directors (assuming that the convertible preferred stock owned by advance/newhouse (the "a/n preferred stock") has not been converted into shares of our common stock). the a/n preferred stock carries with it the right to designate three preferred stock directors to our board (subject to certain conditions), but does not carry voting rights with respect to the election of the eight common stock directors. also, under the terms of the a/n preferred stock, advance/newhouse has special voting rights as to certain enumerated matters, including material amendments to the restated charter and bylaws, fundamental changes in our business, mergers and other business combinations, certain acquisitions and dispositions and future issuances of capital stock. although there is no stockholder agreement, voting agreement or any similar arrangement between mr. malone and advance/newhouse, by virtue of their respective holdings, mr. malone and advance/newhouse each have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders.

business overview we are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including pay-tv, fta and broadcast television, authenticated applications, digital distribution arrangements and content licensing agreements. our portfolio of networks includes prominent television brands such as discovery channel, our most widely distributed global brand, tlc, animal planet, id, velocity (known as turbo outside of the u.s.) and eurosport, a leading sports entertainment pay-tv programmer across europe and asia. we also develop and sell curriculum-based education products and services and operate production studios.
our objectives are to invest in content for our networks to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales, and create or reposition branded channels and businesses that can sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. in addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we are extending content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, on-line streaming, mobile devices, vod and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, dth satellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors, that deliver our content to their customers.
our content spans genres including survival, exploration, sports, lifestyle, general entertainment, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health and kids. we have an extensive library of high-definition content and own rights to much of our content and footage, which enables us to exploit our library to launch brands and services into new markets quickly. our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms.
although the company utilizes certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations in two reportable segments: u.s. networks, consisting principally of domestic television network brands, and international networks, consisting primarily of international television network brands. for further discussion of our company, segments in which we do business, and our content development activities and revenues, see our business overview set forth in item 1, "business" in this annual report on form 10-k.
our consolidated results of operations for 2017 and 2016 were as follows (in millions).

net (loss) income available to discovery communications, inc.            $(337     )            $1,194               nm nm - not meaningful revenues distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks, supplemented by revenue earned from svod content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution. distribution revenue increased 8%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 7%. u.s. networks distribution revenue increases were driven by increases in affiliate fee rates and increases in svod revenue partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers. total u.s. networks portfolio subscribers declined 5% for the year ended december 31, 2017, while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3% for the same period. international networks' distribution revenue increase was mostly due to increases in contractual rates in europe following further investment in sports content, and to a lesser extent increases in latin america due to increases in rates offset by decreases in subscribers. contributions from other distribution revenues also contributed slightly to growth. other distribution revenues were comprised of content deliveries under licensing agreements. these increases were partially offset by decreases in contractual rates in asia.
advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and economic conditions. these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. advertising revenue increased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase for our u.s. networks was primarily due to pricing increases and continued monetization of our go platform, partially offset by lower audience delivery due to continued linear distribution audience universe declines. international networks' increases were primarily due to increased volume across key markets in europe, particularly southern europe and germany, and latin america. the increase was partially offset by declines in ad sales due to lower pricing and volume in asia.
other revenue increased 4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to the formation and consolidation of the vten joint venture during the third quarter of the current year. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 9%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, own and ten acquisitions and the group nine transaction, costs of revenues increased 7% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to increased spending on content at our international networks segment, particularly sports rights and associated production costs. content amortization was $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, own and ten acquisitions, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to transaction costs for the scripps networks acquisition and integration costs of $79 million, including the $35 million charge associated with the modification of advance/newhouse's preferred stock. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
impairment of goodwill goodwill impairment expense of $1.3 billion was recognized during the year ended december 31, 2017. (see note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. depreciation and amortization was consistent for the year ended december 31, 2017, compared with the prior period as capital spending has remained consistent over the periods.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased $17 million. the increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related termination costs for voluntary and involuntary severance actions. (see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss (gain) on disposition the change in loss (gain) on disposition was $67 million. we recorded a $4 million loss for the year ended december 31, 2017 due to the sale of the raw and betty production studios on april 28, 2017, compared with a gain of $63 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the gain on disposition recorded for the year ended december 31, 2016 is comprised of the $50 million gain for the deconsolidation of our digital networks business seeker and sourcefed studios in connection with the group nine transaction and the $13 million gain due to the disposition of our radio businesses in the nordics. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense interest expense increased $122 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 primarily due to costs incurred for the unsecured bridge loan commitment as well as interest accrued on the senior notes issued on september 21, 2017 for the financing of the anticipated scripps networks acquisition. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss on extinguishment of debt on march 13, 2017, we issued new senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $650 million and used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that closed on march 13, 2017. as a result, we recognized a $54 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which included $50 million for premiums to par value, $2 million of non-cash write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs, $1 million for the write-off of the original issue discount of the existing senior notes and $1 million accrued for other third-party fees. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
loss from equity investees, net losses from our equity method investees increased $173 million primarily due to losses from investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy, partially offset by increases in earnings at own and decreases in losses at all3media. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
foreign currency (losses) gains, net                             $(83     )               $75
remeasurement gain on previously held equity interest              33                       -
other-than-temporary impairment of afs investments                  -                     (62     )
other expense increased $114 million in 2017. we recorded foreign currency losses during 2017 compared to foreign currency gains during 2016, mostly due to exchange rate changes on the u.s. dollar compared with the british pound that impacted foreign currency monetary assets. increases in losses from derivative instruments primarily resulted from losses of $98 million on interest rate contracts used to economically hedge the pricing for the issuance of a portion of the dollar-denominated senior notes, which were settled on september 21, 2017. the interest rate contracts did not receive hedging designation. the losses were partially offset by various other items, including a gain of $17 million on previously settled interest rate contracts for which the hedged issuance of debt is considered remote following the issuance of the senior notes on september 21, 2017. (see note 9 and note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) on november 30, 2017, the company acquired from harpo a controlling interest in own. we recognized a remeasurement gain to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of previously held 49.50% equity interest. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)

income tax expense was $176 million and $453 million and our effective tax rate was (128)% and 27% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. during 2017, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of non-cash goodwill impairment charges that are non-deductible for tax purposes. thereafter, the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to investment tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments, and to a lesser extent, the domestic production activity deduction benefit, the allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions, and the impact of the 2017 tax act (see note 16 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements). the benefits were partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in 2017. in 2016, we favorably resolved multi-year state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions that did not recur in 2017.
we evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments based on financial measures such as revenues and adjusted oibda. adjusted oibda is defined as operating income excluding: (i) mark-to-market share-based compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) restructuring and other charges, (iv) certain impairment charges, (v) gains and losses on business and asset dispositions, and (vi) certain inter-segment eliminations related to production studios. additionally, beginning with the quarter ended september 30, 2017, adjusted oibda also excludes material incremental third-party transaction costs directly related to the scripps networks acquisition and planned integration. we use this measure to assess the operating results and performance of our segments, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance, and allocate resources to each segment. we believe adjusted oibda is relevant to investors because it allows them to analyze the operating performance of each segment using the same metric management uses. we exclude mark-to-market share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, certain impairment charges, gains and losses on business and asset dispositions and scripps networks acquisition and integration costs from the calculation of adjusted oibda due to their impact on comparability between periods. we also exclude the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and deferred launch incentives as these amounts do not represent cash payments in the current reporting period. certain corporate expenses and inter-segment eliminations related to production studios are excluded from segment results to enable executive management to evaluate segment performance based upon the decisions of segment executives. as of january 1, 2017, the company no longer excludes amortization of deferred launch incentives in calculating total adjusted oibda as this expense is not material. for the year ended december 31, 2016, deferred launch incentives of $13 million were not reflected as an adjustment to the calculation of total adjusted oibda in order to conform to the current presentation.
adjusted oibda should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, operating income, net (loss) income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
additional financial information for our segments and geographical areas in which we do business is discussed in note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

revenues distribution revenue consists principally of fees from affiliates for distributing our linear networks, supplemented by revenue earned from svod content licensing and other emerging forms of digital distribution. distribution revenues increased 5%. excluding the impact of the own acquisition, distribution revenues increased 4%, primarily driven by increases in affiliate fee rates and increases in svod revenue due to the timing of content deliveries. these increases were partially offset by a decline in affiliate subscribers. total portfolio subscribers declined 5% for the year ended december 31, 2017, while subscribers to our fully distributed networks declined 3% for the same period.
advertising revenue increased 3%. excluding the impact of the own and ten acquisitions and the group nine transaction, advertising revenue increased 2% for the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was primarily due to pricing
increases and continued monetization of our go platform, partially offset by lower audience delivery due to continued linear distribution audience universe declines.
other revenue increased 30% primarily due to the formation and consolidation of the vten joint venture during the third quarter of the current year. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 3% for the year ended december 31, 2017. excluding the impact of own and ten acquisitions and the group nine transaction, costs of revenue increased 1%. content amortization was $752 million and $716 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4%. excluding the impact of own and ten acquisitions and the group nine transaction, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1% for the year ended december 31, 2017. increased spending on viewer research was offset by decreases in personnel and marketing costs.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda increased 5% primarily due to increases in distribution and advertising revenues, partially offset by increases in costs of revenues. excluding the impact of the own and ten acquisitions and the group nine transaction, adjusted oibda also increased 5%.

revenues distribution revenue increased 11%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, distribution revenue increased 9%. the increase was mostly due to increases in contractual rates in europe following further investment in sports content, and to a lesser extent increases in latin america due to increases in rates offset by decreases in subscribers. contributions from other distribution revenues also contributed slightly to growth. other distribution revenues were comprised of content deliveries under licensing agreements. these increases were partially offset by decreases in contractual rates in asia.
advertising revenue increased 4%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, advertising revenue increased 3%. the increase was primarily driven by increases in volume across key markets in europe, particularly southern europe and germany, and latin america. the increase was partially offset by declines in ad sales due to lower pricing and volume in asia.
other revenue remained consistent with the prior year.
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 15%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, costs of revenues increased 12%. the increase was mostly attributable to increased spending on content, particularly sports rights and associated production costs. content amortization was $1.1 billion and $976 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses remained consistent with the prior year.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda increased 3% as increases in distribution and advertising revenues were offset by increases in costs of revenues, related to content expense.

the impairment of goodwill presented above for corporate and inter-segment eliminations is a portion of the total goodwill impairment recorded for the european reporting unit during 2017. the remaining portion of the impairment of $489 million is a component of our international networks segment. the presentation of goodwill impairment is consistent with the financial reports that are reviewed by the company's ceo. goodwill has been allocated from corporate assets to reporting units within corporate and inter-segment eliminations.
the decrease in mark-to-market share-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in discovery's stock price in 2017 compared to 2016. changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for stock appreciation rights ("sars") and performance-based restricted stock units ("prsus"). by contrast, stock options and service-based restricted stock units ("rsus") are fair valued at grant date and amortized over their vesting period without mark-to-market adjustments. the expense associated with stock options and rsus is included in adjusted oibda as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.
items impacting comparability from time to time certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods. in comparing the financial results for the years 2017 and 2016, the company has identified foreign currency as one such item, as noted below. the company also has various acquisitions and dispositions that impact the comparability of our results. to the extent that the transaction materially impacts a particular item or segment, it may be discussed in the relevant section above (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidating financial statements).
foreign currency the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results. for example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis ("ex-fx"), in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap, provides useful information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-fx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.
the ex-fx change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. the ex-fx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process, (the "2016 baseline rate") and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2016 baseline rate. in addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-fx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below (in millions). results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

nm - not meaningful revenues distribution revenue includes affiliate fees and digital distribution revenue and is largely dependent on the rates negotiated in our distribution agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, and the market demand for the content that we provide. distribution revenue increased 5%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015, distribution revenue increased 7% at our u.s. networks segment and 9% at our international networks segment. u.s. networks distribution revenue increased primarily due to contractual rate increases partially offset by slight declines in subscribers. international networks' distribution revenue increases were mostly due to increases in rates in europe and increases in subscribers and rates in latin america.
advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content, our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels, market demand, the mix of sales of commercial time between the upfront and scatter markets, and economic conditions. these factors impact the pricing and volume of our advertising inventory. advertising revenue decreased 1%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, advertising revenue increased 2% as a result of increases of 2% at our u.s. networks and 3% at our international networks. the increase for our u.s. networks was due to inventory management and pricing increases, partially offset by a decline in ratings. the increase for our international networks was primarily driven by ratings and volume in southern europe, and to a lesser extent, pricing, ratings and volume in central and eastern europe, the middle east, and africa ("ceemea"), partially offset by lower ratings in northern europe.
other revenue decreased 2%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, other revenue, which includes revenues from services provided to equity investees, increased 3%. this was due to increases at our u.s. networks offset by decreases at our international networks.
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 4%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015 and the disposition of the company's radio business, costs of revenues increased 7% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for content on our networks, particularly sports rights and associated production costs, and increases in content impairments in northern europe as a result of changes in programming strategies. content amortization was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee costs, marketing costs, research costs, occupancy and back office support fees. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5% for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was due to increases in mark-to-market equity-based compensation expense from increases in the company's stock price and marketing expense.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. depreciation and amortization declined slightly for the year ended december 31, 2016 as there were slight declines in capital spending and no new significant business combinations.
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges increased $8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to personnel-related termination costs for voluntary and involuntary severance actions in the second quarter of 2016. (see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) this increase was partially offset by decreases in content impairments that were classified as other charges.
(gain) loss on disposition gain on disposition increased $80 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as a result of a gain recorded upon the deconsolidation of our digital networks businesses seeker and sourcefed studios on december 2, 2016 in connection with the group nine media transaction, and the recognition of a gain following the resolution of the final contingent payment for the sale of the radio business, compared with an expected loss in the prior year. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense interest expense increased for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily due to the march 11, 2016 issuance of the 4.90% senior notes due march 2026. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
(loss) income from equity investees, net losses from our equity method investees increased $39 million due to investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy and increased losses at all3media for derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting.

other income (expense), net increased $101 million in 2016. the change is primarily the result of gains in foreign currency offset by a $62 million other-than-temporary impairment in the value of our lionsgate shares (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). the change in foreign currency (gains) losses, net is caused by the remeasurement of foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. for the year ended december 31, 2016, exchange rate changes in the british pound resulted in net remeasurement gains. the gains in the current year are in contrast to losses in the prior period for the remeasurement of our 1.90% euro-dominated senior notes due march 19, 2027, which have been effectively hedged for the year ended december 31, 2016 , and remeasurement losses on monetary assets in venezuela following a steep decline in value during the prior year.

income tax expense was $453 million and $511 million and the effective tax rate was 27% and 33% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. the net 6% decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to the resolution of multi-year state tax positions that resulted in a reduction of reserves related to uncertain tax positions, allocation and taxation of income among multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions, the impact of various foreign legislative changes, and tax credits that we receive related to our renewable energy investments. the decrease was partially offset by 2015 favorable audit resolutions which positively impacted the assessment of uncertain tax positions for 2015 but did not recur in 2016. (see note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
as of january 1, 2017, the company no longer excludes amortization of deferred launch incentives in calculating total adjusted oibda as this expense is not material. for the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, deferred launch incentives of $13 million and $16 million, respectively, were not reflected as an adjustment to the calculation of total adjusted oibda in order to conform to the current presentation.

revenues distribution revenue increased 3%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015, distribution revenue increased 9%. the increase was mostly due to increases in rates in europe and increases in subscribers and rates in latin america. such growth is consistent with the value negotiated in new arrangements following investment in sports content in markets in europe and the continued development of the pay-tv markets in latin america.
advertising revenue decreased 5%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, advertising revenue increased 3%. the increase was primarily driven by ratings and volume in southern europe, and, to a lesser extent, pricing, ratings and volume in ceemea, partially offset by lower ratings in northern europe and lower price, ratings and volume in asia.
other revenue decreased 22%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, other revenue decreased 17% due to a reduction in sublicensing revenue for eurosport.
costs of revenues costs of revenues increased 6%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the acquisition of eurosport france in march 2015, and the disposition of the company's radio business, costs of revenues increased 11%. the increase was mostly attributable to increased spending on content, particularly sports rights and associated production costs, and increases in content impairments, primarily in northern europe as a result of changes in programming strategies. content amortization was $976 million and $906 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4%. the components of selling, general and administrative expenses included increases in personnel expenses and marketing costs.
adjusted oibda adjusted oibda decreased 12%. excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the disposition of the company's radio business, adjusted oibda decreased 3%. the decrease was primarily due to higher content expense partially offset by increases in distribution revenue.

corporate operations primarily consist of executive management, administrative support services and substantially all of our equity-based compensation.
adjusted oibda remained consistent with the prior period.
the increase in mark-to-market equity-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to an increase in discovery's stock price in 2016 compared to 2015. changes in stock price are a key driver of fair value estimates used in the attribution of expense for stock appreciation rights ("sars") and performance-based restricted stock units ("prsus"). by contrast, stock options and service-based restricted stock units ("rsus") are fair valued at grant date and amortized over their vesting period without mark-to-market adjustments. the expense associated with stock options and rsus is included in adjusted oibda as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.
items impacting comparability from time to time, certain items may impact the comparability of our consolidated results of operations between two periods. in comparing the financial results for the years 2016 and 2015, the company has identified foreign currency and the impact of the acquisition of eurosport as items impacting comparability between periods, as noted below.
foreign currency the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons of our results. for example, our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis (ex-fx), in addition to results reported in accordance with gaap provides useful
information about our operating performance because the presentation ex-fx excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility and highlights our core operating results. the presentation of results on a constant currency basis should be considered in addition to, but not a substitute for, measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.
the ex-fx change represents the percentage change on a period-over-period basis adjusted for foreign currency impacts. the ex-fx change is calculated as the difference between the current year amounts translated at a baseline rate, a spot rate for each of our currencies determined early in the fiscal year as part of our forecasting process, (the "2015 baseline rate") and the prior year amounts translated at the same 2015 baseline rate. in addition, consistent with the assumption of a constant currency environment, our ex-fx results exclude the impact of our foreign currency hedging activities as well as realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses. the impact of foreign currency on the comparability of our results is reflected in the tables below (in millions). results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity sources of cash historically, we have generated a significant amount of cash from operations. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we funded our working capital needs primarily through cash flows from operations. as of december 31, 2017, we had $7.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. we maintain an effective registration statement on form s-3 that allows us to conduct registered offerings of securities, including debt securities, common stock and preferred stock. access to sufficient capital from the public market is not assured.
•   debt debt incurred for the scripps networks acquisition in august and september 2017, the company entered into $2 billion of term loan credit facilities and issued $6.8 billion of senior notes to fund a portion of the scripps networks acquisition. on september 21, 2017, dcl, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, issued $5.9 billion in senior fixed rate notes, $400 million in senior floating rate notes (together, the "2017 usd notes") and £400 million principal amount of 2.500% fixed rate senior notes (the "sterling notes"), collectively the "2017 senior notes." using exchange rates as of december 31, 2017, the senior notes had a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.9% without including the impact of debt issuance costs. the proceeds received by dcl from the 2017 senior notes were net of a $11 million issuance discount and $57 million of debt issuance costs. the 2017 senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company. some of these proceeds have been invested in short-term investments until the closing of the acquisition. approximately $5.9 billion aggregate principal amount of the senior notes is subject to repayment by the company to satisfy provisions related to the special mandatory redemption provision attached to certain series of the 2017 senior notes. the special mandatory redemption provision requires the company to redeem the applicable senior notes for a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable senior notes, following a termination of the scripps networks merger agreement or if the merger does not close prior to august 30, 2018. the $5.9 billion principal amount of senior notes subject to the special mandatory redemption provision will be classified as noncurrent until either of the contingent events which would trigger the redemption has occurred. as of december 31, 2017, neither of the contingent events have occurred and therefore these senior notes are classified as noncurrent.
on august 11, 2017, dcl, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, entered into a three-year delayed draw tranche and a five-year delayed draw tranche unsecured term loan credit facility (the "term loans"), each with a principal amount of up to $1 billion. the term of each delayed draw loan begins when discovery borrows the funds to finance a portion of the purchase price of the scripps networks acquisition. the term loans' interest rates are based, at the company's option, on either adjusted libor plus a margin or an alternate base rate plus a margin. the company will pay a commitment fee of 20 basis points per annum for each loan, based on its current credit rating, beginning september 28, 2017 until either the funding of the term loans or the termination of the scripps networks acquisition. as of december 31, 2017, the company has not yet borrowed on the term loan credit facilities.
issuance of debt to fund the tender offer for outstanding senior notes on march 13, 2017, dcl issued $450 million principal amount of 3.80% senior notes due march 13, 2024 (the "march 2017 usd notes") and an additional $200 million principal amount of its existing 4.90% senior notes due march 11, 2026 (the "2016 usd notes"). the company used the proceeds to fund the repurchase of $600 million of combined aggregate principal amount of our then-outstanding senior notes through a cash tender offer that also closed on march 13, 2017.
all of dcl's outstanding senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by discovery and contain certain covenants, events of default and other customary provisions.
revolving credit facility we also have access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, as amended on august 11, 2017 (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). borrowing capacity under this agreement is reduced by the amount of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2017, the company had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $425 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.69%. the revolving credit facility agreement provides for a maturity date of august 11, 2022, and the option for two additional 364-day renewal periods. all obligations of dcl and the other borrowers under the revolving credit facility are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by discovery. borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes.
the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility (the "credit agreement") contains customary representations, warranties and events of default, as well as affirmative and negative covenants, which mirror the provisions of the credit agreement governing the term loans, including limitations on liens, investments, indebtedness, dispositions, affiliate transactions, dividends and restricted payments. dcl, its subsidiaries and discovery are also subject to a limitation on mergers, liquidation and disposals of all or substantially all of their assets. the credit agreement, as amended on august 11, 2017, continues to require dcl to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 3.00 to 1.00 and now requires a consolidated leverage ratio of financial covenant of 5.50 to 1.00, with step-downs to 5.00 to 1.00 in the first year after the closing and 4.50 to 1.00 in the second year after the closing. as of december 31, 2017, discovery, dcl and the other borrowers were in compliance with all covenants and there were no events of default under the credit agreement.
commercial paper under our commercial paper program and subject to market conditions, dcl may issue unsecured commercial paper notes guaranteed by the company from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $1.0 billion. the maturities of these notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days. the notes may be issued at a discount or at par, and interest rates vary based on market conditions and the credit ratings assigned to the notes at the time of issuance. as of december 31, 2017, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. borrowings under the commercial paper program would reduce the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility arrangement referenced above.
we repay our senior notes, term loans, revolving credit facility and commercial paper as required, and accordingly these sources of cash also require use of our cash.
•   cash settlement of common stock repurchase contract we elected to settle our outstanding prepaid common stock repurchase contract in cash during the twelve months ended december 31, 2017, resulting in the receipt of $58 million. the cash received was inclusive of a $1 million premium over the $57 million up-front cash payment made in 2016 and was determined by the market price of our series c common stock during the settlement period in march 2017. (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   dispositions on february 26, 2018, we announced the planned sale of a controlling equity stake in its education business in the first half of 2018 to francisco partners for cash of $120 million. no loss is expected upon sale. the company will retain an equity interest. (see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   real estate strategy and relocation of global headquarters on january 9, 2018, we announced a new real estate strategy with plans to relocate the company's global headquarters from silver spring, maryland to new york city, new york in 2019. contingent upon the closing of our acquisition of scripps networks, we will establish a national operation headquarters at scripps networks' current campus in knoxville, tennessee. the sale and closure of our silver spring building is expected approximately one year from the closing of the scripps networks transaction.
uses of cash our primary uses of cash include the creation and acquisition of new content, business acquisitions, repurchases of our capital stock, income taxes, personnel costs, principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt, and funding for various investments.
•   investments and business combinations scripps networks acquisition on february 26, 2018, the u.s. department of justice notified the company that it has closed its investigation into discovery's agreement for a plan of merger to acquire scripps networks in a cash-and-stock transaction. the estimated merger consideration for the acquisition totals $12.0 billion, including cash of $8.4 billion and stock of $3.6 billion based on the series c common stock price as of january 31, 2018. in addition, the company will assume scripps networks' net debt of approximately $2.7 billion in aggregate principal amount. the transaction is expected to close by early 2018.
scripps networks shareholders will receive $63.00 per share in cash and a number of shares of discovery's series c common stock that is determined in accordance with a formula and subject to a collar based on the volume weighted average price of the company's series c common stock. the formula is based on the volume weighted average price of discovery's series c common stock over the 15 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to closing (the "average discovery price"). scripps networks shareholders will receive 1.2096 shares of discovery's series c common stock if the average discovery price is below $22.32, and 0.9408 shares of discovery's series c common stock if the average discovery price is above $28.70. the intent of the range was to provide scripps networks shareholders with $27.00 of value per share in discovery series c common stock; if the average discovery price is greater than or equal to $22.32 but less than or equal to $28.70, scripps networks shareholders will receive a proportional number of shares between 1.2096 and 0.9408. if the average discovery price is below $25.51, discovery has the option to pay additional cash instead of issuing more shares above the 1.0584 conversation ratio required at $25.51. the cash payment is equal to the product of the additional shares required under the collar formula multiplied by the average discovery price; for example, if the average discovery price were $22.32 with a conversion ratio of 1.2096, the company could offer shares at the 1.0584 ratio and pay for the difference associated with the incremental
shares in cash. outstanding employee equity awards or share-based awards that vest upon the change of control will be acquired with a similar combination of cash and shares of discovery series c common stock pursuant to terms specified in the merger agreement. therefore, the merger consideration will fluctuate based upon changes in the share price of discovery series c common stock and the number of scripps networks common shares, stock options, and other equity-based awards outstanding on the closing date. discovery will also pay certain transaction costs incurred by scripps networks. the post-closing impact of the formula was intended to result in scripps networks' shareholders owning approximately 20% of discovery's fully diluted common shares and discovery's shareholders owning approximately 80%. the company will utilize previously issued debt proceeds (see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) and cash on hand to finance the cash portion of the transaction. the transaction is subject to approvals and other customary closing conditions.
on july 30, 2017, the company obtained a commitment letter from a financial institution for a $9.6 billion unsecured bridge term loan facility that could have been used to complete the scripps networks acquisition. no amounts were drawn under the bridge loan commitment and the commitment was terminated on september 21, 2017, following the execution of the term loans and the issuance of the 2017 senior notes. the company incurred $40 million of debt issuance costs related to the bridge loan commitment.
during 2017, the company issued $6.8 billion in senior notes to fund the anticipated scripps networks acquisition (see note 3 and note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) of these total proceeds, $2.7 billion were invested in money market funds, $1.3 billion were invested in time deposit accounts, and the remainder was invested in highly liquid, short-term instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less. these investments are classified as cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet and are anticipated to be used for the scripps networks acquisition. in the interim, the company has full access to these proceeds.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we incurred transaction and integration costs for the scripps networks acquisition of $79 million, including the $35 million charge associated with the modification of advance/newhouse's preferred stock. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we expect to continue to incur transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of scripps networks in 2018.
•   other investments and business combinations our uses of cash have included investment in equity method investments, afs securities, cost method investments (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and business combinations. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the company invested $322 million in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy. the company has $20 million of future funding commitments for these investments as of december 31, 2017 and intends to reduce its investments starting in 2018. we provide funding to our equity method investees from time to time. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the company acquired other equity method investments, largely to enhance the company's digital distribution strategies and made additional contributions to existing equity method investments totaling $73 million.
on november 30, 2017, the company acquired from harpo a controlling interest in own increasing discovery's ownership stake from 49.50% to 73.99%. discovery paid $70 million in cash and recognized a gain of $33 million to account for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the previously held 49.50% equity interest. the gain is included in other (expense) income, net in the company's consolidated statements of operations. (see note 3 and note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
our cost method investments as of december 31, 2017 primarily include a 42% minority interest in group nine media with a carrying value of $212 million. the company also has investments in an educational website and an electric car racing series. (see note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
due to business combinations, we also have redeemable equity balances of $413 million, which may require the use of cash in the event holders of noncontrolling interests put their interests to the company. (see note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).
•   content acquisition we plan to continue to invest significantly in the creation and acquisition of new content. additional information regarding contractual commitments to acquire content is set forth in "commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements" in item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in this annual report on form 10-k.
•   common stock repurchase program under the company's stock repurchase program, management was authorized to purchase shares of the company's common stock from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase or other derivative arrangements as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements and subject to stock price, business and market conditions and other factors. as of december 31, 2017, the company had repurchased 3 million and 164 million shares of series a and series c common stock over the life of the program for the aggregate purchase price of $171 million and $6.6 billion, respectively. the company's authorization under the program expired on october 8, 2017, and we have not repurchased any shares of common stock since then. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) we have funded our stock repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and the issuance of debt. in the future, we may also choose to fund stock repurchases through borrowings under our revolving credit facility and future financing transactions.
•   preferred stock conversion and repurchase prior to the exchange agreement with advance/newhouse entered into on july 30, 2017, we had an agreement with advance/newhouse to repurchase, on a quarterly basis, a number of shares of series c-1 convertible preferred stock convertible into series c common stock purchased under the company's stock repurchase program during the then most recently completed fiscal quarter. the price paid per share was calculated as 99% of the average price paid for the series c common shares repurchased by the company during the applicable fiscal quarter multiplied by the series c conversion rate. the advance/newhouse repurchases are made outside of the company's publicly announced stock repurchase program. the advance/newhouse repurchase agreement was amended on august 7, 2017 to conform the terms of the previous agreement, as detailed above, to the conversion ratio of the newly issued series c-1 convertible preferred stock. prior to the exchange agreement, we converted and retired 2.3 million shares of our series c convertible preferred stock under the preferred stock conversion and repurchase arrangement for an aggregate purchase price of $120 million. following the exchange agreement, we repurchased 0.2 million shares of series c-1 convertible preferred stock for a purchase price of $102 million. the aggregate purchase price paid during the year ended december 31, 2017, including series c convertible preferred stock and series c-1 convertible preferred stock, was $222 million. (see note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
•   income taxes and interest we expect to continue to make payments for income taxes and interest on our outstanding senior notes. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we made cash payments of $274 million and $357 million for income taxes and interest on our outstanding debt, respectively.
•   restructuring and other our uses of cash include restructuring costs related to management changes and cost reduction efforts, including employee terminations, intended to enable us to more efficiently operate in a leaner and more directed cost structure and invest in growth initiatives, including digital services and content creation. as of december 31, 2017, we have restructuring liabilities of $42 million related to employee terminations. (see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). we expect to incur additional restructuring costs following the acquisition of scripps networks in early 2018.
•   share-based compensation we expect to continue to make payments for vested cash-settled share-based awards. actual amounts expensed and payable for cash-settled awards are dependent on future fair value calculations, which are primarily affected by changes in our stock price or changes in the number of awards outstanding. during 2017, we paid $1 million for cash-settled share-based awards. as of december 31, 2017, liabilities totaled $47 million for outstanding liability-classified share-based compensation awards, of which $12 million was classified as current. (see note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
cash flows changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows (in millions).
cash provided by operating activities                                  1,629                 1,380               1,294

operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased $249 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to a $253 million decrease in cash paid for taxes. the decrease in cash paid for taxes, net, for the year ended december 31, 2017 is mostly due to the tax impact from the company's investments in limited liability companies that sponsor renewable energy projects related to solar energy. (see note 4 and note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) declines in working capital, primarily due to changes in accounts receivable, were offset by a decrease in the net negative effect of foreign currency and increases in payables.
cash provided by operating activities increased $96 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. improvements in operating results were partially offset by increases in content spending, particularly for sports rights, of $131 million and the impact of foreign currency.
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased $377 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2016. the increase was mostly attributable to an increase in payments for investments of $172 million, including renewable energy projects and payments for derivative instruments of $98 million that did not receive hedge accounting, but economically hedged pricing risk for the senior notes issued september 21, 2017.
cash flows used in investing activities decreased $45 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for business combinations, net of cash acquired of $80 million, partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from dispositions of businesses of $42 million.
financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increased $7.1 billion for the twelve months ended december 31, 2017 as compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes which will be used to finance the scripps networks acquisition (see note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and a decrease in repurchases of stock of $771 million, offset by an increase in principal repayments of debt.
cash flows used in financing activities increased $265 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was attributable to an increase in repurchases of stock of $423 million and a decrease in net borrowings of $471 million, which is comprised of increases in repayments under our revolving credit facility, net of repayments, of $973 million partially offset by increased borrowings of senior notes, net of repayments, of $411 million and decreases in commercial paper repayments of $91 million. these net increases were partially offset by decreases in purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests of $548 million and payments on hedging instruments for derivatives in connection with the effective portion of interest rate contracts of $69 million.
capital resources as of december 31, 2017, capital resources were comprised of the following (in millions).
totalcapacity       outstandingletters ofcredit             outstandingindebtedness           unusedcapacity cash and cash equivalents                                     $7,309              $-                                      $-                                $7,309

we expect that our cash balance, cash generated from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for the next twelve months, including any potential required payments related to the special mandatory redemption provision associated with certain senior notes issued on september 21, 2017. our borrowing costs and access to the capital markets can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in part, on our performance as measured by credit metrics, such as interest coverage and leverage ratios.
as of december 31, 2017, we held $103 million of our $7.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries. the 2017 tax act features a participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income and imposes a mandatory repatriation toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings. notwithstanding the u.s. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to the u.s. however, if these funds are needed in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay foreign taxes to repatriate them. the determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to these undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable.
additional information regarding the changes in our outstanding indebtedness and the significant terms and provisions of our revolving credit facility and outstanding indebtedness is discussed in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" in this annual report on form 10-k.

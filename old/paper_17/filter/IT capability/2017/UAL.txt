item 1a.   risk factors.
the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the companys business and the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time. any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the companys business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report.
global economic, political and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable conditions may have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations.
the companys business and results of operations are significantly impacted by global economic and industry conditions. the airline industry is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the u.s. and global economies. the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives significant operating revenues. the companys international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network. volatile economic, political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the companys operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives.
robust demand for the companys air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions, including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies, low unemployment levels, strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit. air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times. in addition, during periods of unfavorable economic conditions, business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel, either due to cost-saving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel. during such periods, the companys business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand, particularly with respect to the companys business and premium cabin travelers, and a reduction in fare levels.
stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions, and any future volatility in u.s. and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the companys revenues, results of operations and liquidity. if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future, the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms (or at all) to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments.
in june 2016, united kingdom (uk) voters voted for the uk to exit the eu. the uk parliament voted in favor of allowing the government to commence negotiations to determine the future terms of the uks relationship with the eu, including the terms of trade between the uk and the eu and other nations. a process of negotiation is now taking place to determine the future terms of the uks relationship with the eu. depending on the outcome of these negotiations, we could face new challenges in our operations, such as instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the british pound and european euro, additional travel restrictions on passengers traveling between the uk and other eu countries and legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations. these adverse effects in european market conditions could negatively impact the companys business, results of operations and financial condition.
in addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and other currencies may have a material adverse impact upon the companys liquidity, revenues, costs and operating results.
the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on the company.
the u.s. airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition including from low-cost carriers. the significant market presence of low-cost carriers, which engage in substantial price discounting, may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes.
airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity, including route systems and the number of markets served. several of the companys domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves, causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations. this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
terrorist attacks or international hostilities, or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities, even if not made directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect the company and the airline industry.
the terrorist attacks on september 11, 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as the prospects for the airline industry. among the effects experienced from the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faa-imposed temporary grounding of the u.s. airline industrys fleet, significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience, increased insurance costs, substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue.
additional terrorist attacks, even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks (including elevated national threat warnings, travel restrictions or selective cancellation or redirection of flights) could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry. wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. the companys financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities.
increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach may adversely affect the companys business.
the company is subject to increasing legislative, regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security. also, a number of the companys commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that the company must meet and these standards continue to evolve. the company will continue its efforts to meet its privacy and data security obligations; however, it is possible that certain new obligations may be difficult to meet and could increase the companys costs. additionally, the company must manage evolving cybersecurity risks. the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to customers, employees or business partners information or the companys failure to meet its obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. a significant data breach or the companys failure to meet its obligations may adversely affect the companys reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.
the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business.
the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business, including computerized airline reservation systems, flight operations systems, revenue management systems, accounting systems, telecommunication systems and commercial websites, including www.united.com. uniteds website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information, as well as process critical financial transactions. these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events, some of which are beyond the companys control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment or software failures, computer viruses or cyber security attacks. substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions, including failures or disruptions related to the companys complex integration of systems, could reduce the attractiveness of the companys services versus those of its competitors, materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights, result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, result in increased costs, lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data, and may adversely affect the companys business, results of operations and financial condition.
current or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or arrangement relating to these actions, could have a material adverse impact on the company.
from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies, including as described in part i, item 3, legal proceedings, of this report. no assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. an adverse resolution of lawsuits, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of non-monetary remedies, and could also result in adverse publicity. defending ourselves in these matters may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of managements time and attention from the operation of our business, which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives. additionally, any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment, settlement, fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance. if we fail to comply with the terms contained in any settlement, order or agreement with a governmental authority relating to these matters, we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties, which could have a material adverse impact on the company. under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into (and may in the future enter into) with our officers, directors and certain third parties, we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions, suits, investigations and other proceedings. there can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material.
disruptions to the companys regional network and united express flights provided by third-party regional carriers could adversely affect the companys operations and financial condition.
the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as united express. these regional operations are an extension of the companys mainline network and complement the companys operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. the companys business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network, with regional capacity accounting for approximately 11% of the companys total capacity for the year ended december 31, 2017.
although the company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics, the company does not control the operations of these carriers. a number of factors may impact the companys regional network, including weather-related effects and seasonality. in addition, the decrease in qualified pilots driven by federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the companys regional flying. for example, the faas expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards, including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1,500 total flight hours, as well as the faas revised pilot flight and duty time rules, effective january 2014, have contributed to a smaller supply of pilots available to regional carriers. the decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking u.s. military from which to hire qualified pilots, could adversely impact the companys operations and financial condition, and also require the company to reduce regional carrier flying.
if a significant disruption occurs to the companys regional network or flights or if one or more of the regional carriers with which the company has relationships is unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, there could be a material adverse effect on the companys business, financial condition and operations.
the companys business relies extensively on third-party service providers. failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in the companys relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company, could have an adverse effect on the companys financial position and results of operations.
the company has engaged third-party service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business, including regional operations, operation of customer service call centers, distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, provision of information technology infrastructure and services, transmitting or uploading of data, provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs, provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft
fueling operations, and catering services, among other vital functions and services. the company does not directly control these third-party service providers, although it does enter into agreements with most of them that define expected service performance. any of these third-party service providers, however, may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company, may suffer disruptions to their systems that could impact their services, or the agreements with such providers may be terminated. for example, flight reservations booked by customers and travel agencies via third-party gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators. such disruptions, including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation, may cause the companys flight information to be limited or unavailable for display, significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users and impair the companys relationships with its customers and travel agencies. the failure of any of the companys third-party service providers to perform their service obligations adequately, or other interruptions of services, may reduce the companys revenues and increase its expenses, prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to its brand. in addition, the companys business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory.
orders for new aircraft typically must be placed years in advance of scheduled deliveries, and changes in the companys route network over time may make aircraft on order less economic for the company, but any modification or termination of such orders could result in material liability for the company.
the companys orders for new aircraft are typically made years in advance of actual delivery of such aircraft, and the financial commitment required for purchases of new aircraft is substantial. at december 31, 2017, the company had firm commitments to purchase 228 new aircraft from the boeing company (boeing) and airbus s.a.s (airbus), as well as related agreements with engine manufacturers, maintenance providers and others. at december 31, 2017, the companys commitments relating to the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines, aircraft improvements and other related obligations aggregated to a total of $22.2 billion.
subsequent to the company placing an order for new aircraft, the companys route network may change, such that the aircraft on order become less economic to operate flights in the companys network. as a result, the companys preference for a particular aircraft that it has ordered, often years in advance, may be decreased or eliminated. if the company were to seek to modify or terminate its existing aircraft order commitments, it may be responsible for material obligations to its counterparties arising from any such change. however, the company expects that any such change that it makes would be in the long-term best economic interest of the company.
the company could experience adverse publicity, harm to its brand, reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident, catastrophe, or incident involving its aircraft or its operations, the aircraft or operations of its regional carriers or the aircraft or operations of its codeshare partners, which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial position.
an accident, catastrophe, or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates, or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the companys regional carriers, or an incident involving the companys operations, could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident, catastrophe, or incident created a public perception that the companys operations, or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers, are not safe or reliable, or are less safe or reliable than other airlines. such public perception could, in turn, result in adverse publicity for the company, cause harm to the companys brand and reduce travel demand on the companys flights, or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers.
in addition, any such accident, catastrophe, or incident could expose the company to significant tort liability. although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe, and the companys codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations, if the companys liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of
another carrier to indemnify it, the company could incur substantial losses from an accident, catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial position.
if we experience changes in, or are unable to retain, our senior management team or other key employees, our operating results could be adversely affected.
much of our future success depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge, including our senior management team and other key employees. if we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key employees, or if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, our business may be adversely affected.
high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the companys strategic plans, operating results, financial position and liquidity.
aircraft fuel is critical to the companys operations and is one of its single largest operating expenses. the timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources, as well as related service and delivery infrastructure. although the company has some ability to cover short-term fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations, it can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the companys system. the company generally sources fuel at prevailing market prices.
aircraft fuel has historically been the companys most volatile operating expense due to the highly unpredictable nature of market prices for fuel. market prices for aircraft fuel have historically fluctuated substantially in short periods of time and continue to be highly volatile due to a dependence on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the companys control. these factors include changes in global crude oil prices, the balance between aircraft fuel supply and demand, natural disasters, prevailing inventory levels and fuel production and transportation infrastructure. prices of fuel are also impacted by indirect factors that may potentially impact fuel supply or demand balance, such as geopolitical events, economic growth indicators, fiscal/monetary policies, fuel tax policies, environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets. both actual changes in these factors, as well as changes in market expectations of these factors can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel price levels in short periods of time.
given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, the company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices, especially if these increases are significant, rapid and sustained. further, any such fare and fee increases may not be sustainable, may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the companys strategic growth and investment plans for the future. in addition, decreases in fuel prices for an extended period of time may result in increased industry capacity, increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general. if fuel prices were to then subsequently rise quickly, there may be a lag between the rise in fuel prices and any improvement of the revenue environment.
to protect against increases in the market prices of fuel, the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements. however, the companys hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs, and any price protection provided may be limited due to choice of hedging instruments and market conditions, including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties. to the extent that the company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly, such hedge contracts may limit the companys ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future. if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the company enters into a hedge contract, the company may be required to post collateral (margin) beyond certain thresholds. there can be no assurance that the companys hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the companys hedging arrangements.
additionally, deterioration in the companys financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future.
union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions could adversely affect the companys operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance.
united is a highly unionized company. as of december 31, 2017, the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 89,800 active employees, of whom approximately 80% were represented by various u.s. labor organizations.
there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the company entering into collective bargaining agreements with its represented employee groups. there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns, work-to-rule campaigns, sick-outs or other actions designed to disrupt the companys normal operations, in an attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations. although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to self-help, and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature self-help, such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined. in addition, collective bargaining agreements with the companys represented employee groups increase the companys labor costs, which increase could be material for any applicable reporting period.
an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the companys business, financial position and results of operations.
an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand, travel behavior, or travel restrictions could have a material adverse impact on the companys business, financial condition and results of operations.
extensive government regulation could increase the companys operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business.
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight. compliance with u.s. and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company. laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges, both domestically and internationally, have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue.
united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot. if the dot altered, amended, modified, suspended or revoked these certificates, it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business. the faa regulates the safety of uniteds operations. united operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa. in 2014, the faas more stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations took effect, which has increased costs for all carriers. additionally, minimum qualifications took effect for air carrier first officers. these regulations will continue to impact the industry and the company for years to come, as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots, while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire. although this is an industry issue, it directly affects the company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying, as several regional partners have experienced difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced pilot availability. from time to time, the faa also issues orders, airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company. these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design, manufacturing, maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action. these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company.
in 2018, the u.s. congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the faa, which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy related issues. as with previous reauthorization legislation, the u.s. congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact the companys operations and costs.
in addition, the companys operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated atc system utilized by the u.s. government. during peak travel periods in certain markets, the current atc systems inability to handle atc demand has led to short-term capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic. in addition, the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth. imposition of these atc constraints on a long-term basis may have a material adverse effect on the companys operations. failure to update the atc system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations.
access to landing and take-off rights, or slots, at several major u.s. airports and many foreign airports served by the company are, or recently have been, subject to government regulation. certain of the companys major hubs are among the most congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights and/or increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day. the faa may limit the companys airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports, which could affect the companys ownership and transfer rights, and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to their facilities, which could have an adverse effect on the companys business. the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines slot holdings that airlines have challenged; if the faa were to take actions that adversely affect the companys slot holdings, the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots. if slots are eliminated at an airport, or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport, the lack of controls on takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both at the affected airport or in the regional airspace (e.g., the new york city metropolitan region airspace) and could significantly impact the companys operations. further, the companys operating costs at airports, including the companys major hubs, may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund, directly or indirectly. such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the companys approval and may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition.
many aspects of the companys operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws protecting the environment. future environmental regulatory developments, such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry. in addition, there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of ghgs by the aviation industry. the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict, but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant.
see part i, item 1, businessindustry regulation, of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company.
extensive government regulation on international routes could restrict the companys ability to conduct its business and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and results of operations.
the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between the united states and other countries may be subject to change. applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time, government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised, and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change. the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements, regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes, the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes, the airports at which carriers may operate international flights, or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports. any further limitations, additions or modifications to such arrangements, regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and results of operations. additionally, a change in law, regulation or policy for any of the companys international routes, such as open skies, could have a
material adverse impact on the companys financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets. in addition, competition from revenue-sharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the companys business and assets on the open skies routes. the companys plans to enter into or expand u.s. antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable u.s. federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements. there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied.
see part i, item 1, businessindustry regulation, of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company.
the airline industry may undergo further change with respect to alliances and joint ventures or due to consolidations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company.
the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to the modification of alliances and formation of new joint ventures. carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances, slot swaps and/or joint ventures. certain types of airline joint ventures further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes, pool revenues and costs, and enjoy other mutual benefits, achieving many of the benefits of consolidation. open skies agreements, including the agreements between the united states and the eu and between the united states and japan, may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers. movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for joint ventures and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment. there is ongoing speculation that further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future, especially if new open skies agreements between brazil and the united states are fully implemented. the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position, including current and potential alliances, asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities. if other airlines participate in such activities, those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities, thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the companys ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships.
insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and business.
the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations, including aircraft lease and debt financings, leases of airport property and other facilities, and other material cash obligations. in addition, the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines.
although the companys cash flows from operations and its available capital, including the proceeds from financing transactions, have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date, the companys future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this report, including, but not limited to, substantial volatility in the price of fuel, adverse economic conditions, disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events.
if the companys liquidity is materially diminished due to the various risk factors noted in this report, or otherwise, the company might not be able to timely pay its leases and debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations. certain of these covenants require the company or united, as applicable, to maintain minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. the companys or uniteds ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, including the overall industry revenue environment, the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of the collateral.
if the company does not timely pay its leases and debts or comply with such covenants, a variety of adverse consequences could result. these potential adverse consequences include an increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements, withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers, loss of undrawn lines of credit, the occurrence of one or more events of default under the relevant agreements, the acceleration of the maturity of debt and/or the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and results of operations. the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such debt if it were accelerated. in addition, an event of default or acceleration of debt under certain of its financing agreements could result in one or more events of default under certain of the companys other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions.
furthermore, insufficient liquidity may limit the companys ability to withstand competitive pressures and downturns in the travel business and the economy in general.
the companys substantial level of indebtedness and non-investment grade credit rating, as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms, or at all.
see part ii, item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, of this report for additional information regarding the companys liquidity.
increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the companys results of operations and financial condition.
the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event, including aircraft accidents. the company maintains insurance policies, including, but not limited to, terrorism, aviation hull and liability, workers compensation and property and business interruption insurance, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance with acceptable terms or if the coverage obtained is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the company experiences, whether due to insurance market conditions, policy limitations and exclusions or otherwise, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
the companys results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry.
due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year, which are periods of lower travel demand. the companys results of operations generally reflect this seasonality, but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal, including, among others, the imposition of excise and similar taxes, extreme or severe weather, atc congestion, geological events, natural disasters, changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, general economic conditions and other factors. as a result, the companys quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.
the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its long-lived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations.
in accordance with applicable accounting standards, the company is required to test its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. in addition, the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
the company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to, among other factors, extreme fuel price volatility, tight credit markets, a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets, unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment, as well as other uncertainties. the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period. the value of the companys aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers. an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and results of operations.
the companys ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for u.s. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.
as of december 31, 2017, ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss (nol) carryforwards of approximately $2.4 billion.
the companys ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an ownership change as defined in section 382 (section 382) of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code). an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporations stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change.
there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards. potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock, including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of any convertible debt that ual may issue in the future, the repurchase of such debt with ual common stock, any issuance of ual common stock for cash, and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5% or more of ual common stock, or a combination of such transactions, may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382.
under section 382, a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of pre-ownership change nols that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporations stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. any unused annual limitation may, subject to certain limits, be carried over to later years, and the limitation may, under certain circumstances, be increased by built-in gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change. this limitation could cause the companys u.s. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause all or a portion of the companys nol carryforwards to expire unused. similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. the companys ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. the companys nol carryforwards may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full.
the final impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act could be materially different from our current estimates.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law (the tax act). the tax act introduced significant changes to the code. we continue to examine the impact the tax act may have on our business. notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate as a result of tax act, the estimated impact of the new law is based on managements current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based upon our further analysis of the new law.
our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect.
an important part of our strategy to expand our global network includes making significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expanding our commercial relationships with these carriers. in 2015, we made a $100 million investment in azul linhas aéreas brasileiras s.a. (azul) and enhanced our commercial arrangements with azul. we expect to continue exploring similar non-controlling investments in, and entering into joint ventures, commercial agreements, loan transactions and strategic alliances with, other carriers as part of our global business strategy. these transactions and relationships (including our strategic partnership with, and investment in, azul) involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that we may not receive repayment of invested funds, that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.
in addition, we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate. while we work closely with these carriers, we do not have control over their operations or business methods. we may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners, including for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act. furthermore, our relationships with these carriers may be subject to the laws and regulations of non-u.s. jurisdictions in which these carriers are located or conduct business. any political or regulatory change in these jurisdictions that negatively impact or prohibit our arrangements with these carriers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview united continental holdings, inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, ual or the company) is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is united airlines, inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, united). as ual consolidates united for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of united also apply to ual, unless otherwise noted. uniteds operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of uals revenues and operating expenses. in addition, united comprises approximately the entire balance of uals assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. when appropriate, ual and united are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of ual and united are separately disclosed and explained. we sometimes use the words we, our, us, and the company in this report for disclosures that relate to all of ual and united.
2017 financial highlights
   uniteds consolidated prasm decreased 0.4% in 2017 compared to 2016.
                  in 2017, ual repurchased approximately 28 million shares of ual common stock for $1.8 billion, completing the $2.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by uals board of directors in july
2016. in december 2017, uals board of directors authorized a new $3.0 billion share repurchase program to acquire uals common stock. as of december 31, 2017, the company had approximately $3.0 billion remaining to purchase shares under its share repurchase program.
   ual ended the year with $5.8 billion in unrestricted liquidity, which consisted of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and available capacity under the revolving credit facility.
2017 operational highlights
   consolidated rpms for 2017 increased 2.8% as compared to 2016, and consolidated asms increased 3.5% from the prior year, resulting in a consolidated load factor of 82.4% in 2017 versus 82.9% in 2016.
   for 2017 and 2016, the company recorded a dot on-time arrival rate of 81.9% and 81.3%, respectively, and a system completion factor of 99.0% for each year.
outlook set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results and/or from our anticipated results of operations described in the forward-looking statements in this report. see part i, item 1a., risk factors, of this report and the factors described under forward-looking information below for additional discussion of these and other factors that could affect us.
in 2017, the company had its best operational performance in its post-merger history. operational reliability, service and experience underpin the companys long-term strategy. our priorities for 2018 are continued top-tier operational reliability while strengthening our domestic network through growth, driving efficiency and productivity and continued investment in our employees, product and technology.
economic conditions. the aviation industry in 2018 is expected to show continued growth in the demand for air travel. passenger numbers are expected to increase. cargo volumes are also expected to grow, with some recovery in yields. passenger revenue in all regions are expected to demonstrate improved performance in 2018.
capacity. in 2018, the company expects its consolidated asms to grow between 4% and 6% year-over-year. most of this growth will be concentrated in our domestic network, especially in our mid-continent hubs. we believe greater scale and connectivity at our hubs reinforces our relevance and value proposition to our customers. rebanking at our hubs is expected to drive significant additional connection opportunities. we will also expand flights in non-peak times of the year to more efficiently use our aircraft and facilities with the objective of driving an increase in profitability.
fuel. the companys average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was $1.74 in 2017 as compared to $1.49 in 2016. the price of jet fuel has increased since january 2016 and remains volatile. based on projected fuel consumption in 2018, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the companys annual fuel expense by approximately $96 million.
results of operations in this section, we compare results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 with results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016, and results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 with results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2015.
operating revenue the table below illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in the companys operating revenues for the years ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):
2017               2016                    increase       % change
the table below presents selected passenger revenue and operating data of the company, broken out by geographic region, expressed as year-over-year changes:
asms (capacity)                           4.9 %                  0.4%                  2.9 %                 2.4%                     3.5 %                   4.4 %                  (3.8)%
(a) see part ii, item 6, selected financial data, of this report for the definition of these statistics.
consolidated passenger revenue increased $0.9 billion, or 3.0%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to a 2.8% increase in traffic. consolidated prasm decreased 0.4% in 2017 as compared to 2016. the decline in prasm was driven by factors including more aggressive low-cost carrier pricing in our hub markets, temporary share loss during roll-out of our basic economy pricing, and softer demand in china and guam. our revenue in 2017 was negatively impacted by severe storms during the third quarter.
operating expense the table below includes data related to the companys operating expense for the years ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):
2017              2016                   increase       % change

salaries and related costs increased $770 million, or 7.5%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to higher pay rates and benefit expenses driven by collective bargaining agreements finalized in 2016, and a 2.5% increase
in average full-time equivalent employees, partially offset by a decrease in profit sharing and other employee incentives.
aircraft fuel expense increased $1.1 billion, or 18.9%, primarily due to increased fuel prices and a 3.5% increase in capacity. the table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the years ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):
(in millions)           %                                average price per gallon change

regional capacity purchase costs increased $35 million, or 1.6%, in 2017 as compared to the year-ago period despite regional capacity being down 3.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to increases in annual rates, maintenance cycle-related costs and lease return costs.
depreciation and amortization increased $172 million, or 8.7%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to additions of new and used aircraft, aircraft improvements and increases in information technology infrastructure and application development projects.
aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $107 million, or 6.1%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in airframe and engine maintenance visits and additional repairs to wireless and inflight entertainment equipment.

see note 14 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information.
other operating expenses increased $236 million, or 4.4%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to increased costs in food, marketing and technology associated with the companys enhanced customer experience initiatives, and due to volume-driven increases in cargo trucking and handling costs.

(a) see part ii, item 6, selected financial data, of this report for the definition of these statistics.
consolidated passenger revenue decreased $1.3 billion, or 4.1%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. consolidated prasm decreased 5.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015. the decline in prasm was driven by factors including a competitive domestic fare environment, lower surcharges, a strong u.s. dollar and reductions from energy-related corporate travel.
cargo revenue decreased $61 million, or 6.5%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to lower freight yields and lower mail volumes year-over-year, partially offset by an increase in freight volumes. freight yields were negatively impacted as air freighter competitors increased capacity in response to lower fuel prices. another contributing factor to the year-over-year decrease was a u.s. west coast port labor dispute that resulted in an increase in air freight results in the first quarter of 2015. the labor dispute was resolved during the first quarter of 2015.
operating expense the table below includes data related to the companys operating expense for the years ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):

salaries and related costs increased $562 million, or 5.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to higher pay rates and benefit expenses driven by new and extended collective bargaining agreements, an increase in employee incentive expenses due to improvements in operational performance and a 2.2% increase in average full-time equivalent employees, partially offset by a reduction in profit sharing expense in 2016 as compared to 2015, a reduction in medical and dental costs and the results of certain costs savings initiatives in 2016.
the decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices and a reduction in fuel hedge losses, partially offset by the impact of a 1.4% increase in capacity. 2016 fuel expense includes the benefit of a $20 million fuel tax refund. the table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the years ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):

depreciation and amortization increased $158 million, or 8.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to additions of new aircraft, conversions of operating leases to capital leases, aircraft improvements, accelerated depreciation of certain assets related to several fleet types and increases in information technology assets.
aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $98 million, or 5.9%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a year-over-year increase in airframe maintenance visits as a result of the cyclical timing of these visits and volume-driven increases in component costs, partially offset by a reduction in costs due to the timing of maintenance on certain engines.
aircraft rent decreased $74 million, or 9.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to lease expirations, the purchase or capital lease conversion of several operating leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft.
impairment of assets                                                $412           $79

see note 14 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information.
other operating expenses increased $343 million, or 6.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to increases in ground handling costs, food and technology costs associated with the companys enhanced customer experience initiatives, rate-driven increases in hotel expenses for crews, increases in marketing expenses related to the 2016 summer olympics and volume-driven increases in cargo costs.
the following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in the companys nonoperating income (expense) for the years ended december 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):
2016             2015              increase             % change

the decrease in interest expense of $55 million, or 8.2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the prepayment of certain debt issuances in 2015 and declining balances of other debt, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued for the acquisition of new aircraft, the conversion of certain operating leases to capital leases and certain constructed airport assets accounted for as capital leases.
in 2015, miscellaneous, net included losses of $80 million from fuel derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting. foreign currency losses were approximately $43 million and $129 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. foreign currency results included $8 million and $61 million of foreign exchange losses for 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the companys cash holdings in venezuela. miscellaneous, net for 2015 also includes a $134 million special charge related to the write-off of unamortized non-cash debt discounts for the early redemption of the 6% notes due 2026 (the 2026 notes) and the 6% notes due 2028 (the 2028 notes).
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2017, the company had $3.8 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a decrease of $0.6 billion from december 31, 2016. the company had its entire commitment capacity of $2.0 billion under the revolving credit facility of the companys amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of march 29, 2017 (as amended by the first amendment to the amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement, dated as of november 15, 2017, the 2017 credit agreement) available for borrowings as of december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2017, the company had $109 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, which is primarily collateral for letters of credit and collateral associated with obligations for facility leases and workers compensation. we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to provide security for obligations. restricted cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2016 totaled $124 million.
we have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations. at december 31, 2017, the company had approximately $14.4 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $1.7 billion that are due within the next 12 months. in addition, we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. as of december 31, 2017, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $5.6 billion. however, approximately $6.1 billion of our current liabilities are related to our advance ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue, both of which largely represent revenue to be recognized for travel in the near future and not cash outlays. the deficit in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows, liquidity or operations.
the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to prepay its debt, including open market repurchases, to reduce its indebtedness and related interest.
for 2018, the company expects between $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion of gross capital expenditures. see note 13 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on commitments.
as of december 31, 2017, a substantial portion of the companys assets, principally aircraft, route authorities, airport slots and loyalty program intangible assets, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. we must sustain our profitability and/or access the capital markets to meet our significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines. see note 10 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the company.
operating activities
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $3.4 billion compared to $5.5 billion in the same period in 2016, the decrease resulting from lower operating income and reduced cash flows from certain changes in working capital items. excluding the non-cash impairment of the newark slots, operating income for 2017 was approximately $1.2 billion lower than 2016. working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by an additional $1.2 billion year-over-year in 2017 as compared to 2016. the following were significant working capital items in 2017:
   $0.4 billion increase in prepayments for maintenance contracts.
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $5.5 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the same period in 2015. working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by

   other assets, including spare parts, increased by $0.3 billion as part of the companys efforts to improve fleet reliability.
investing activities
the companys capital expenditures were $4.0 billion and $3.2 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. the companys capital expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of new aircraft, aircraft improvements, facility and fleet-related costs and the purchase of information technology assets.
the companys capital expenditures were $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the companys capital expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, facility and fleet-related costs and the purchase of information technology assets.

leases and capacity purchase agreements   note 11
commitments and contingencies             note 13
contractual obligations. the companys business is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. in the past, the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. the company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.

(a)   long-term debt presented in the companys financial statements is net of $163 million of debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs which are being amortized over the debt terms. contractual payments are not net of the debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs.
(b)   includes interest portion of capital lease obligations of $72 million in 2018, $63 million in 2019, $59 million in 2020, $56 million in 2021, $52 million in 2022 and $391 million thereafter. interest payments on variable interest rate debt were calculated using london interbank offered rates (libor) applicable at december 31, 2017.
(c)          represents our estimates of future minimum noncancelable commitments under our cpas and does not include the portion of the underlying obligations for aircraft and facility rent that is disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. amounts also exclude a portion of uniteds capital lease obligation recorded for certain of its cpas. see note 11 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for the significant assumptions used to estimate the payments.
(d)   amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2026. benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded.
(e)   represents an estimate of the minimum funding requirements as determined by government regulations for uniteds u.s. pension plans. amounts are subject to change based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of assets in the plans and bond rates. see critical accounting policies, below, for a discussion of our current year assumptions regarding uniteds pension plans.
(f)   represents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft, spare engines and other capital purchase commitments. see note 13 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for a discussion of our purchase commitments.
off-balance sheet arrangements. an off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements. the companys primary off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table under contractual obligations, above, and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below.
as of december 31, 2017, united had cash collateralized $75 million of letters of credit. united also had $362 million of surety bonds securing various obligations at december 31, 2017. most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis. the surety bonds have expiration dates through 2021.
as of december 31, 2017, united is the guarantor of approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. these bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies. the leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases. the leasing arrangements associated with a portion of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases. the annual lease payments for those obligations are included in the contractual obligations table under contractual obligations, above.
as of december 31, 2017, united is the guarantor of $157 million of aircraft mortgage debt issued by one of uniteds regional carriers. the aircraft mortgage debt is subject to increased cost provisions and the company would potentially be responsible for those costs under the guarantees. the increased cost provisions in the $157 million of aircraft mortgage debt are similar to those in certain of the companys debt agreements. see discussion under increased cost provisions, below, for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the companys debt.
eetcs. as of december 31, 2017, united had $8.6 billion principal amount of equipment notes outstanding issued under eetc financings. generally, the structure of these eetc financings consists of pass-through trusts created by united to issue pass-through certificates, which represent fractional undivided interests in the respective pass-through trusts and are not obligations of united. the proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates are used to purchase equipment notes which are issued by united and secured by its aircraft. the payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of united. proceeds received from the sale of pass-through certificates are initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until united issues equipment notes to the trust, which purchases such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds. these escrowed funds are not guaranteed by united and are not reported as debt on uniteds consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary are not uniteds assets.
increased cost provisions. in uniteds financing transactions that include loans, united typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and, in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on libor, for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law, subject, in most cases, to obligations of the lenders to take certain limited steps to mitigate the requirement for, or the amount of, such increased costs. at december 31, 2017, the company had $3.4 billion of floating rate debt and $60 million of fixed rate debt, with remaining terms of up to 11 years, that are subject to these increased cost provisions. in several financing transactions involving loans or leases from non-u.s. entities, with remaining terms of up to 11 years and an aggregate balance of $3.3
billion, the company bears the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to non-u.s. entities to withholding taxes, subject to customary exclusions.
fuel consortia. united participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. the
consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. in general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. as of december 31, 2017, approximately $1.5 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates, as to which united and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt. as of december 31, 2017, the companys contingent exposure was approximately $244 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. the companys contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases. the guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2022 to 2049. the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements.
revenue recognition. the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage. the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines. differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate. when necessary, the company records a reserve against its interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different. non-refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date. basic economy tickets cannot be extended and refunds are not allowed except for ticket cancellations that are within 24 hours of purchase and one week or more prior to the original scheduled departure flight.
fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred. the fare on the changed ticket, including any additional collection of fare, is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided. change fees related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the companys additional service to modify a previous sale. therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes.
the company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused. these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends. refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance.
the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (topic 606). topic 606 prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard impacts the classification of certain revenue streams and affects the timing of revenue and expense recognition for others. for the company, the most significant impact of the standard is the reclassification of certain ancillary fees from other operating revenue into passenger revenue on the statement of consolidated operations. for 2016 and 2017, the amount to be
reclassified at adoption of the new standard from other operating revenue into passenger revenue under topic 606 is approximately $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. these ancillary fees are directly related to passenger travel, such as ticket change fees and baggage fees, and will no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the passenger travel component. in addition, the ticket change fees, which were previously recognized when received, will be recognized when transportation is provided. on january 1, 2018, we adopted topic 606 using the full-retrospective approach. see note 1 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information on recently issued accounting standards.
frequent flyer accounting. uniteds mileageplus program is designed to increase customer loyalty. program participants earn miles by flying on united and certain other participating airlines. program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in uniteds loyalty program. we sell miles to these partners, which include domestic and international credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels, car rental companies and our participating airline partners. miles can be redeemed for free (other than taxes and government imposed fees), discounted or upgraded air travel and non-travel awards. the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model.
when frequent flyers earn miles for flights, the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement. the company determines the estimated selling price of air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis. the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements, individually, on a pro rata basis. the miles are recorded in frequent flyer deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheet and recognized into revenue when the transportation is provided.
the companys estimated selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount, which incorporates the expected redemption of miles, as the best estimate of selling price for these miles. the equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12 months weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern, cabin class, loyalty status and geographic region. the estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by a fulfillment discount that considers a number of factors, including redemption patterns of various customer groups.
united has a significant contract to sell mileageplus miles to its co-branded credit card partner, chase. united identified the following significant revenue elements in its second amended and restated co-branded card marketing services agreement (the co-brand agreement): the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile (generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above); use of the united brand and access to mileageplus member lists; advertising; and other travel related benefits.
the fair value of the elements is determined using managements estimated selling price of each element. the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, volume discounts, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the co-brand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered. we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis, which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis.
the company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members, which we refer to as breakage. the company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns. miles expire after 18 months of member account
inactivity. the companys estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs.
the following table summarizes information related to the companys frequent flyer deferred revenue liability:

long-lived assets. the net book value of operating property and equipment for the company was $26 billion and $23 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. the assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges.
the company records assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost. depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be between 25 and 30 years. residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the companys fleet plan and other relevant information. a one-year increase in the average depreciable life of the companys flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately $76 million.
the company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. for purposes of this testing, the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment. an impairment charge is recognized when the assets carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. the amount of the charge is the difference between the assets carrying value and fair market value.
see note 14 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information.
indefinite-lived intangible assets. the company has indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill. goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1, or on an interim basis whenever a triggering event occurs. an impairment occurs when the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. in 2017, the hong kong routes had a fair value cushion that was less than 10% of its carrying value. the value of the routes was negatively impacted by the slowdown of the hong kong market coupled with industry oversupply. as a result, this intangible asset is susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in this particular market. while management has implemented strategies to address the shifts in supply and demand dynamics, further adverse changes could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair value and could trigger impairment charges of the hong kong routes.
see note 2 to the financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for additional information.
defined benefit plan accounting. we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets.
uniteds pension plans under-funded status was $1.9 billion at december 31, 2017. funding requirements for tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. in 2018, we anticipate
contributing at least $420 million to our pension plans. the fair value of the plans assets was $3.9 billion at december 31, 2017.
when calculating pension expense for 2018, the company assumed that its plans assets would generate a long-term rate of return of approximately 7.3%. the expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. our projected long-term rate of return reflects the active management of our plans assets. the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.
the defined benefit pension plans assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts. return generating investments include primarily equity securities, fixed-income securities and alternative investments (e.g. private equity and hedge funds). risk mitigating investments include primarily u.s. government and investment grade corporate fixed-income securities. the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31, 2017:
percent of total      expected long-term rate of return equity securities                        36 %                   9.5 %
fixed-income securities                    37                     5.5
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points (from 7.3% to 6.8%) would increase estimated 2018 pension expense by approximately $20 million. future pension obligations for uniteds plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 3.65% at december 31, 2017. the company selected the discount rate for substantially all of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31, 2017 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments. the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points (from 3.65% to 3.15%) would increase the pension liability at december 31, 2017 by approximately $651
million and increase the estimated 2018 pension expense by approximately $80 million. future changes in plan asset returns, plan provisions, assumed discount rates, pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.
actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans, those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees. all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
other postretirement benefit plan accounting. uniteds postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits, primarily in the united states, to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as other benefits. united also has retiree medical programs that permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and
medicare eligibility. eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits, which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement. plan benefits are subject to co-payments, deductibles and other limits as described in the plans.
the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plans funded status, in its financial statements. other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. united has not been required to pre-fund its plan obligations, which has resulted in a significant net obligation, as discussed below. the companys benefit obligation was $1.7 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31, 2017 and 2016.
the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. the company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. the companys weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31, 2017 was 3.63%, as compared to 4.07% for december 31, 2016. the health care cost trend rate assumed for 2017 was 6.50%, declining to 5.0% in 2023, as compared to assumed trend rate for 2018 of 6.25%, declining to 5.0% in 2023. a 1% increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the companys total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31, 2017 by $11 million; whereas, a 1% decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the companys total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31, 2017 by $8 million. a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the companys postretirement benefit liability by approximately $185 million and increase the estimated 2017 benefits expense by approximately $8 million.
actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans. under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans, actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the company had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of $301 million and $384 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
income taxes. the tax act, among other changes, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. as of december 31, 2017, we had not completed our analysis of all aspects of the tax act. however, we have made a provisional estimate for its effect on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. we are still analyzing certain aspects of the tax act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts.

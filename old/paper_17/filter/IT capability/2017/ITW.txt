item 1a. risk factors the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. these risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
the company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. downturns in the markets served by the company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition.
the company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. slower economic growth, financial market instability, high unemployment, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the markets the company serves can adversely affect the company's businesses by reducing demand for the company's products and services, limiting financing available to the company's customers, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, or increasing the risk that counterparties to the company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations.
the global nature of the company's operations subjects it to political and economic risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.
•   limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises;
•   price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings;
•   political, social and economic instability and disruptions;
•   the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;
•   limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and
if the company is unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
the benefits from the company's enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the company's financial results could be adversely impacted.
as the company has substantially completed its enterprise strategy initiatives of portfolio management and business structure simplification, its focus has pivoted to organic revenue growth and continued margin improvement. product line and customer base simplification activities, which are core elements of the company's 80/20 front to back process, continue to be applied to the company's scaled up operating divisions and remain active elements of the enterprise strategy. although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the company's overall organic revenue growth in the short term. if the company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives, the company's financial results could be adversely impacted.
share repurchases constitute a significant component of the company's capital allocation strategy. the company funds its share repurchases with free cash flow and short-term borrowings. the amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. important factors that could cause the company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the company's common stock, the nature of other investment
opportunities presented to us from time to time, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of u.s. cash.
the company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental or other laws.
the company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the company's strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. the company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, and environmental laws. any such improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation.
although the company's financial results are reported in u.s. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in europe. the company's profitability is affected by movements of the u.s. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies, has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.
if the company is unable to successfully introduce new products, its future growth may be adversely affected.
the company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the company's competitive position. if the company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected.
if the company is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property, its competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
protecting the company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. the company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. the company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or the company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the company's competitive position and results of operations.
the company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns.
the company has engaged in various acquisitions in the past, and could choose to acquire additional businesses in the future. acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the company's profitability and returns:
•   the acquired business could under-perform relative to the company's expectations and the price paid for it, or not perform in accordance with the company's anticipated timetable.
•   acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.
•   the company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the activities of the acquired business. the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may
increase the company's expenses, adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations.
•   as a result of acquisitions, the company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. if the company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets.
past divestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the company's financial results.
the company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with its portfolio management initiative. though the divestiture element of its portfolio management initiative is essentially complete, the company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyer against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters.
the company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. a number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. impairment charges could result that adversely affect the company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized.
disruptions or volatility in global financial markets or changes in the company's credit ratings could increase the company's funding costs or reduce the availability of credit.
global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the financial markets. the company's continued ability to meet its cash requirements requires substantial liquidity and access to the financial markets. in addition, the company's borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. if conditions in the financial markets decline or the company's credit ratings are negatively impacted, its funding costs could be increased or the availability of credit could be diminished.
the supply of raw materials to the company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the company's results of operations and profit margins. due to pricing pressure or other factors, the company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.
the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and in various foreign jurisdictions. domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. the company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. the amount of income taxes is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. authorities. if these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.
the u.s. government has recently enacted comprehensive tax legislation that includes significant changes to the taxation of business entities. the company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and one-time transition tax, however the ultimate impact of this tax reform is uncertain due to subsequent clarification of the tax law and refinement of estimated amounts and the company's business and financial condition could be adversely affected.
the company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.
the performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.
the company's businesses expose it to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors. the company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. in addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.
uncertainty related to climate change regulation and industry standards could impact the company's results of operations and financial position.
increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, than the voluntary commitments that the company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the company or its products, they could negatively impact the company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
if the company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage.
the company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. these technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; attacks by computer hackers; computer viruses; employee error or malfeasance. in addition, security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. if these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the company may suffer financial or reputational damage.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction illinois tool works inc. (the "company" or "itw") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with 85 divisions in 56 countries. as of december 31, 2017, the company employed approximately 50,000 people.
due to the large number of diverse businesses and the company's decentralized operating structure, the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. instead, the company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.
the itw business model the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model is the company's core source of value creation. this business model is the company's competitive advantage and defines how itw creates value for its shareholders and comprises three unique elements:
•   itw's 80/20 front to back process is the operating system that is applied in every itw business. initially introduced as a manufacturing efficiency tool in the 1980s, itw has continually refined, improved and expanded 80/20 into a proprietary, holistic business management process that generates significant value for the company and its customers. through the application of data-driven insights generated by 80/20 practice, itw focuses on its largest and best opportunities (the "80") and eliminates cost, complexity and distractions associated with the less profitable opportunities (the "20"). 80/20 enables itw businesses to consistently achieve world-class operational excellence in product availability, quality, and innovation, while generating superior financial performance;
•   customer-back innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth at itw. the company's unique innovation approach is built on insight gathered from the 80/20 front to back process. working from the customer back, itw businesses position themselves as the go-to problem solver for their "80" customers. itw's innovation efforts are focused on understanding customer needs, particularly those in "80" markets with solid long-term growth fundamentals, and subsequently creating unique solutions to address those needs. these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw and have contributed to a portfolio of more than 17,000 granted and pending patents;
•   itw's decentralized, entrepreneurial culture enables itw businesses to be fast, focused, and responsive. itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their specific customers' needs. itw colleagues recognize their unique responsibilities to execute the company's strategy and values. as a result, the company maintains a focused and simple organizational structure that, combined with outstanding execution, delivers best-in-class services adapted to each business' customers and end markets.
enterprise strategy in late 2012, itw began the first phase of its strategic framework, transitioning the company on its current strategic path to fully leverage the compelling performance potential of the itw business model. since then, itw has made considerable progress, as evidenced by the company's strong financial performance over the past five years.
the roots of itw's enterprise strategy began in late 2011 / early 2012, when the company undertook a complete review of its performance. focusing on its businesses delivering consistent above-market growth with best-in-class margins and returns, itw developed a strategy to replicate that performance across its operations.
based on this rigorous evaluation, itw determined that solid and consistent above-market organic growth must be the core growth engine to deliver world-class financial performance and compelling long-term returns for its shareholders. to shift its primary growth engine to organic, the company began executing a multi-step approach.
•   the first step was to narrow the focus and improve the quality of itw's business portfolio. as part of the portfolio management initiative, itw exited businesses that were operating in commoditized market spaces and prioritized sustainable differentiation as a must-have requirement for all itw businesses. this process included both divesting entire businesses and exiting commoditized product lines and customers inside otherwise highly differentiated itw divisions.
as a result of this work, itw's business portfolio now has significantly higher organic growth potential. itw segments and divisions now possess attractive and differentiated product lines and end markets as they continue to improve operating margins and generate price/cost increases. the company achieved this through product line simplification, or eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, while supporting and growing the businesses' largest / most profitable customers and product lines. with the initiative nearly complete and itw businesses demonstrating notably improved financial performance, the company believes that the product line simplification work is returning to more normalized levels.
•   step two, business structure simplification, was implemented to simplify and scale-up itw's operating structure to support increased engineering, marketing, and sales resources, and, at the same time, improve global reach and competitiveness, all of which were critical to driving accelerated organic growth. itw now has 85 scaled-up divisions with significantly enhanced focus on growth investments, core customers and products, and customer-back innovation.
•   the strategic sourcing initiative established sourcing as a core strategic and operational capability at itw. the company's 80/20-enabled sourcing organization has delivered an average of one percent reduction in spend each year from 2013 through 2017 and is on track to do the same in 2018.
•   with the portfolio realignment and scale-up work largely complete, the company shifted its focus to preparing for and accelerating, organic growth, reapplying 80/20 to optimize its newly scaled-up divisions for growth, first, to build a foundation of operational excellence, and second, to identify the best opportunities to drive organic growth.
itw has clearly demonstrated superior 80/20 management, resulting in meaningful incremental improvement in margins and returns as evidenced by the company's operating margin and after-tax return on invested capital. at the same time, these 80/20 initiatives can also result in restructuring initiatives that reduce costs and improve profitability and returns. with this first phase of the strategy nearing completion, the company will look ahead to the next five years and delivering differentiated performance on a sustained basis.
sustained differentiated performance while the company has made considerable progress and itw's performance is nearing best-in-class levels, the company has significant opportunity for further improvement. the second phase of the strategic framework is focused on delivering differentiated performance on a sustained basis, with consistent above market organic growth. moving forward, the company remains committed to the four strategic principles that have served as the foundation of its progress over the past five years and that the company believes best positions itw to deliver continued differentiated performance over the next five years:
•   the itw business model is the company's competitive advantage
•   focus on quality growth
•   "do what we say" execution is a critical differentiator
•   invest only where itw has a competitive advantage the itw business model is the company's competitive advantage the itw business model is the combination of a set of strategic, operational, and cultural approaches and practices that is applied to every itw business. the business model has existed inside the company for over 30 years and is truly itw's differentiating competitive advantage. the itw business model is comprised of three elements:
•decentralized entrepreneurial culture = how the company executes focus on quality growth itw prioritizes high-quality revenue growth and, as such, the company's primary growth focus is organic.
leveraging the business model and the 80/20 front to back process provides a clear view of where to focus for high- quality growth. the company targets differentiated end-markets and customers with critical needs and challenging pain points. itw generates high-quality growth through consistent customer-back innovation and customer service excellence.
the company only invests and operates in industries and businesses that have the right "raw material" to generate high quality organic growth through the application of the itw business model. itw's current portfolio of seven segments offers solid growth potential and a high degree of diversification in terms of geographic and end market exposures, enabling the company to deliver consistent high-quality growth in an increasingly volatile and competitive global market environment.
"do what we say" execution is a critical differentiator itw's commitment to execution is a key differentiator for itw. living up to the company's commitments - "do what we say" execution - is a deeply embedded core element of the culture. the culture is the engine that translates itw's strategy into action, and action into results.
all divisions function within a "framework" that defines how the culture operates and defines the company's values, business model and strategy to ensure all divisions are working toward our common set of goals. business leaders have the flexibility to define the actions and customize their approach to meet those goals. this "flexibility within the framework" establishes an entrepreneurial environment where decisions are made "bottom up" by those with the greatest knowledge, capability and proximity to the customer, which enables our businesses to be nimble and react quickly to market conditions and customer requirements.
itw is simple, straightforward and transparent in everything it does. the company sets clear performance expectations and financial targets, executes against these at the appropriate pace, and establishes the freedom to define how to achieve results within the construct of the business model.
invest only where itw has a competitive advantage the company is highly focused and disciplined in its approach to invest only where it can leverage the itw business model into compelling and sustainable competitive advantage.
investments to support organic growth and sustain its highly differentiated core businesses, such as new product innovation, marketing programs, simplification projects, and capital investments, are itw's number one investment priority.
terms used by itw management uses the following terms to describe the financial results of operations of the company:
•   product line simplification (pls) - focuses businesses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines; in the short-term, pls may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. in the long-term, pls is expected to result in growth in revenue, profitability, and returns.
consolidated results of operations the company's strong financial results in 2017 demonstrate the combination of itw's high-quality business portfolio with continued focus on leveraging the powerful and highly differentiated itw business model. meaningful progress on accelerating organic revenue growth and strong execution on enterprise initiatives resulted in all seven segments achieving worldwide organic revenue growth and having operating margin above 20% for 2017.
on july 1, 2016, the company completed the acquisition of the engineered fasteners and components business ("ef&c") from zf trw for a purchase price of approximately $450 million. ef&c had operating revenue of $517 million in 2017 and $245 million for the last six months of 2016. ef&c diluted the company's operating margin in 2017 and 2016 due to lower operating margin and acquisition related expenses. the company expects ef&c's operating margin to improve in later years through the application of the company's 80/20 front to back process. the operating results of ef&c are reported within the company's automotive oem segment. the acquisition of ef&c did not materially affect the company's results of operations or financial position for any period presented. refer to note 2. acquisitions in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
the company presents certain financial measures in fiscal year 2017 excluding the $658 million tax charge related to the "tax cuts and jobs act" and the benefit of a favorable $95 million legal settlement. these non-gaap measures are consistent with the way management analyzes and assesses the company's operating performance. the company believes these non-gaap measures enhance investors' understanding of the company's underlying financial performance, as well as their ability to compare the company's financial results and overall performance to that of its peers.
•   operating revenue increased due to growth in organic and acquisition revenues and the favorable effect of foreign currency translation.
•   in the second quarter of 2017, the company entered into a $95 million confidential settlement agreement to resolve a litigation matter. based on the terms of the agreement, the company received the settlement within 120 days of the execution of the agreement. the receipt of the settlement resulted in a favorable pre-tax impact of $15 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $80 million in the third quarter of 2017, which was included in operating income. refer to note 3. legal settlement in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information on the confidential legal settlement.
•   operating margin of 24.4% increased 190 basis points. excluding the 70 basis points of favorability from the confidential legal settlement, operating margin of 23.7% increased 120 basis points primarily driven by the benefits of the company's enterprise initiatives of 120 basis points. in addition, positive operating leverage of 70 basis points was offset by unfavorable price/cost of 40 basis points and the dilutive impact of 30 basis points from the ef&amp;c acquisition.
•   on december 22, 2017, the "tax cuts and jobs act" (the "act") was enacted in the united states. the provisions of the act significantly revise the u.s. corporate income tax rules. as of december 31, 2017, the company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the act; however, the company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and one-time transition tax. as a result, the company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $658 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. the provisional amounts recorded reflect the company's best estimate based on information currently available and are subject to future changes due to subsequent clarification of the tax law and refinement of estimated amounts. refer to note 5. income taxes in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
•   diluted earnings per share (eps) of $4.86 includes the unfavorable impact of $1.90 for the previously discussed one-time tax charge and the favorable impact of $0.17 for the confidential legal settlement. excluding these two items, eps of $6.59 increased 15.6%.

•   organic revenue grew 1.2% as six of seven segments had worldwide organic revenue growth primarily due to penetration gains, higher end market demand and product innovation. organic revenue declined in the welding segment primarily due to lower capital spending in the industrial end markets and sluggish demand in the oil and gas end market.
◦   pls activities associated with the portfolio management component of the company's enterprise strategy reduced organic revenue growth by approximately one percentage point.
•   operating margin of 22.5% increased 110 basis points. the primary driver of the operating margin improvement was 130 basis points from the benefit of the company's enterprise initiatives. positive operating leverage of 30 basis points and favorable price/cost of 10 basis points were partially offset by the dilutive impact of 30 basis points from the ef&amp;c acquisition and additional investment in the business.
•   in 2016, the company received a $167 million cash dividend distribution from wilsonart which exceeded the company's equity investment balance and resulted in a $54 million pre-tax gain, partially offset by $30 million of pre-tax losses related to the disposals of businesses and the disposal of a partnership investment. refer to note 4. other income (expense) in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information on the wilsonart equity investment.

•   the effective tax rate was 48.4% in 2017, 30.0% in 2016, and 30.1% in 2015. included in the effective tax rate for 2017 was a one-time additional income tax expense of $658 million related to the united states "tax cuts and jobs act" and discrete income tax benefits of $50 million related to the new stock-based compensation guidance effective january 1, 2017. refer to note 1. description of business and summary of significant accounting policies and note 5. income taxes in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further information.
in march 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance that includes several changes to simplify the accounting for stock-based compensation, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification of tax benefits in the statement of cash flows. among the more significant changes, the new guidance requires that the income tax effects associated with the settlement of stock-based awards after adoption of the guidance be recognized through income tax expense rather than directly in equity. additionally, the income tax effects related to excess tax benefits should be presented within operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. excess tax benefits recognized in equity under the prior guidance were $29 million and $20 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the company adopted the new guidance effective january 1, 2017 and applied the new guidance prospectively. excess tax benefits of $50 million were included in income taxes in the statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2017. the expected effect on income tax expense or net cash provided from operating activities related to future stock-based award settlements will vary each period and will depend on inputs such as the stock price at the time of settlement and the number of awards settled in the period presented.
in may 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. the core principle of the new guidance is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. the company's sales arrangements with customers are predominately short term in nature and generally provide for transfer of control and revenue recognition at the time of product shipment or delivery of service. in limited circumstances, arrangements may include service performed over time, or there may be significant obligations to the customer that are unfulfilled at the time of shipment, typically involving installation of equipment and customer acceptance. effective january 1, 2018, the company adopted this new guidance under the modified retrospective method which requires the new guidance to be applied prospectively to revenue transactions completed on or after the effective date. given the nature of the company's revenue transactions, the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company's operating revenue, results of operations, or financial position. as a result of adopting the guidance, the company expects to record a cumulative-effect adjustment reducing retained earnings as of january 1, 2018 by approximately $10 million related to certain transactions that were impacted by the new guidance. additionally, the company expects to provide the required additional disclosures in periods subsequent to adoption.
in october 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance requiring the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs rather than when transferred to a third party as required under the current guidance. effective january 1, 2018, the company adopted the new guidance and will apply the newly adopted guidance to intra-entity asset transfers on or after the date of adoption. as a result of adopting the new guidance, the company expects to record a cumulative-effect adjustment reducing deferred tax assets and retained earnings by approximately $400 million. additionally, intra-entity asset transfers may result in future tax rate volatility under the new guidance.
in march 2017, the fasb issued authoritative guidance which changes the income statement presentation of the components of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. the primary change under the new guidance is that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost should be included in operating income and is eligible for capitalization as an asset. the other components of net periodic benefit cost, including interest cost, expected return on assets, settlements, curtailments, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost, should be presented below operating income. effective january 1, 2018, the company adopted the new guidance and will apply the new
presentation of net periodic benefit cost in future periods and expects to restate prior periods for comparability. the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the other components of net periodic benefit cost were income of $9 million, income of $8 million, and expense of $1 million, respectively. refer to note 9. pension and other postretirement benefits for further information regarding the company's net periodic benefit cost.
in february 2016, the fasb issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for recognizing leasing transactions. under the new guidance, a lessee will be required to recognize a lease liability and lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a lease term greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position. subsequent measurement, including presentation of expenses and cash flows, will depend on the classification of the lease as either a financing or operating lease. in addition, several new disclosures will be required. this guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. while the company has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact the new lease accounting guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, the company expects to recognize right of use assets and liabilities for its operating leases in the statement of financial position upon adoption.
liquidity and capital resources the company's primary sources of liquidity are free cash flow and short-term credit facilities. in addition, the company had $3.1 billion of cash on hand at december 31, 2017 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the company's capital allocation priorities, which include:
•   external investments in selective strategic acquisitions that support the company's organic growth focus and an active share repurchase program.
the company believes that, based on its operating revenue, operating margin, free cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.
cash flow the company uses free cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. the company believes this non-gaap financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the company's financial performance and measures the company's ability to generate cash internally to fund company initiatives. free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. free cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies. summarized cash flow information for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:
net cash provided by operating activities                                                                 $2,402              $2,302              $2,299

stock repurchase programs on august 2, 2013, the company's board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provided for the buyback of up to $6.0 billion of the company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the "2013 program"). under the 2013 program, the company repurchased approximately 14.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $96.84 during 2015. as of december 31, 2015, there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the 2013 program.
on february 13, 2015, the company's board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, which provided for the buyback of up to an additional $6.0 billion of the company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the "2015 program"). under the 2015 program, the company repurchased approximately 6.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $91.78 per share during 2015, approximately 18.7 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $107.17 per share during 2016, and approximately 7.1 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $140.56 per share during 2017. as of december 31, 2017, there were approximately $2.4 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2015 program.
adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital the company uses adjusted after-tax return on average invested capital ("roic") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. roic is a non-gaap financial measure that the company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate roic. for comparability, the company excluded the $658 million income tax charge from the effective tax rate and the $95 million confidential legal settlement from the calculation of roic for the year ended december 31, 2017. adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the company's operations, as well as the company's equity investment in the wilsonart business (formerly the decorative surfaces segment). average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter. roic for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was as follows:
invested capital:
total invested capital                                                       $9,823              $9,616              $9,560

adjusted average invested capital                                           $10,005              $9,689              $9,820
adjusted return on average invested capital                                    24.4   %            22.1   %            20.4   %
roic increased 230 basis points for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period as a result of a 13.7% improvement in after-tax operating income versus a 3.3% increase in adjusted average invested capital. the discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation improved after-tax roic by 50 basis points in 2017. roic increased 170 basis points in 2016 versus 2015 as a result of a 7.1% improvement in after-tax operating income and a 1.3% decrease in adjusted average invested capital.
working capital management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the company. net working capital at december 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized as follows:
current liabilities:
net working capital                            $4,225              $3,363                      $862
the increase in net working capital at december 31, 2017 was primarily driven by higher cash and equivalents.
cash and equivalents totaled approximately $3.1 billion as of december 31, 2017 and $2.5 billion as of december 31, 2016, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries. cash and equivalents held internationally may be subject to foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the u.s. a portion of the cash and equivalents balances held internationally is typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally. in the u.s., the company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs, which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. the company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities, for short-term liquidity needs. the company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the u.s.
on december 22, 2017, the "tax cuts and jobs act" (the "act") was enacted in the united states. the provisions of the act significantly revise the u.s. corporate income tax rules, including a one-time repatriation tax on the deemed repatriation of post-1986 undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company recorded a one-time additional income tax expense of $658 million related to the enactment of the act which, among other items, included the one-time deemed repatriation tax. as a result of the one-time repatriation provisions of the act, the company has provided for substantially all u.s. taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and expects to repatriate approximately $2 billion of foreign held cash and equivalents. see note 5. income taxes in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
the company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs, share repurchases, and small and medium-sized acquisitions. during the second quarter of 2016, the company entered into a $2.5 billion, five-year line of credit agreement with a termination date of may 9, 2021 to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. this agreement replaced the previously existing $1.5 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of june 8, 2017 and the $1.0 billion line of credit agreement with a termination date of august 15, 2018. no amounts were outstanding under the new line of credit agreement at december 31, 2017. the maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2017 was $1.1 billion, while the average daily balance was $691 million. as of december 31, 2017, the company's foreign operations had authorized credit facilities with unused capacity of $206 million.
total debt to ebitda the company uses the ratio of total debt to ebitda to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. the company believes that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda. ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are non-gaap financial measures. the ratio of total debt to ebitda represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis. total debt to ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:
ebitda                                                $3,956              $3,534              $3,344

as of december 31, 2017, the company had recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $167 million. the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. the company did not have any significant off-balance sheet commitments at december 31, 2017.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has six accounting policies that it believes are most important to the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company's critical accounting policies are as follows:
realizability of inventories- inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. generally, the company's businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to net realizable value based on the following usage criteria:
usage classification   criteria                                                                                   reserve %
active                 quantity on hand is less than prior 6 months of usage                                       0      %
slow-moving            some usage in last 12 months, but quantity on hand exceeds prior 6 months of usage         50      %
in addition, for approximately 21% of total inventories, the company has elected to use the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method of inventory costing. generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method due to the effects of inflation.
collectibility of accounts receivable- the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the last two years. in addition, reserves for customer credits and cash discounts are estimated based on past experience.
buildings and improvements   150% declining balance machinery and equipment      200% declining balance the majority of the company's international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis.
income taxes- the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. the company's deferred and other tax balances are based on management's interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. income tax expense, assets and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the company's various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company.
goodwill and intangible assets- the company's business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the company's total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods. the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. on an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2017, the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $6.0 billion allocated to its reporting units. although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. in addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the company's 80/20 front to back process. the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately $45 million to $1.3 billion, with the average amount equal to $546 million. fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company's global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.
pension and other postretirement benefits- the company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a number of u.s. employees and many employees outside the u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant's years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. see note 9. pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the u.s. primary pension plan. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be
effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the u.s. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $40 million. beginning in 2017, the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. the new method provides a more precise measure of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash flows rather than a single weighted-average rate. see note 9. pension and other postretirement benefits in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for information on the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions.

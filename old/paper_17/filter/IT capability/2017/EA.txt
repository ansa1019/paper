item 1a.   risk factors our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business or financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline. the risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. there may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe could be material that may harm our business or financial performance.
our business is intensely competitive and "hit" driven. we may not deliver "hit" products and services, or consumers may prefer our competitors' products or services over our own.
competition in our industry is intense. many new products and services are regularly introduced in each major industry segment (console, mobile and pc), but only a relatively small number of "hit" titles account for a significant portion of total revenue in each segment. our competitors range from established interactive entertainment companies and diversified media companies to emerging start-ups, and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge throughout the world. if our competitors develop and market more successful and engaging products or services, offer competitive products or services at lower price points, or if we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality, well-received and engaging products and services, our revenue, margins, and profitability will decline.
we maintain a relatively limited product portfolio in an effort to focus on developing high-quality and engaging products with the potential to become hits. high-quality titles, even if highly-reviewed, may not turn into hit products. many hit products within our industry are iterations of prior hit products with large established consumer bases and significant brand recognition, which makes competing in certain product categories challenging. in addition, hit products or services of our competitors may take a larger portion of consumer spending or time than we anticipate, which could cause our products and services to underperform relative to our expectations. publishing a relatively small number of major titles each year also concentrates risk in those titles and means each major title has greater associated risk. a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games and services based on a few popular franchises, and the underperformance of a single major title could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. for example, we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from sales related to our largest and most popular game, fifa, the annualized version of which is consistently one of the best-selling games in the marketplace. any events or circumstances that negatively impact our fifa franchise, such as game or service quality, the delay or cancellation of a product or service launch, or real or perceived security risks could negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent.
the increased importance of live services revenue to our business heightens the risks associated with our limited product portfolio. live services that are either poorly-received or provided in connection with underperforming games may generate lower than expected sales. any lapse, delay or failure in our ability to provide high-quality live services content to consumers over an extended period of time could materially and adversely affect our financial results, consumer engagement with our live services, and cause harm to our reputation and brand. our most popular live service is the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises. any events or circumstances that negatively impact our ability to reliably provide content or sustain engagement for ultimate team, particularly fifa ultimate team, would negatively impact our financial results to a disproportionate extent.
technology changes rapidly in our business and we may fail to anticipate or successfully implement new technologies or adopt new business strategies, technologies or methods.
rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate, sometimes years in advance, which technologies we must develop, implement and take advantage of in order to make our products and services competitive in the market. we have invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies, technologies, products, and services. for example, we are investing in the infrastructure for our ea player network which we expect will allow us to market and deliver content and services for our franchises more efficiently as well as enable new player-centric ways to discover and try new experiences. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the technology we choose to adopt and the products and services that we pursue will be successful. if we do not successfully implement these new technologies, our reputation and brand may be materially adversely affected and our financial condition and operating results may be impacted. we also may miss opportunities to adopt technology or develop products, services or new ways to engage with our games that become popular with consumers, which could adversely affect our financial results. it may take significant time and resources to shift our focus to such technologies, putting us at a competitive disadvantage.
our development process usually starts with particular platforms and distribution methods in mind, and a range of technical development and feature goals that we hope to be able to achieve. we may not be able to achieve these goals, or our competition
may be able to achieve them more quickly and effectively than we can. in either case, our products and services may be technologically inferior to those of our competitors, less appealing to consumers, or both. if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule for our products and services, then we may delay their release until these goals can be achieved, which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses. alternatively, we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies, either to preserve our product or service launch schedule or to keep up with our competition, which would increase our development expenses.
we may experience security breaches and cyber threats.
our industry is prone to, and our systems and networks are subject to, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks, malicious software programs and other information security incidents that seek to exploit, disable, damage, disrupt or gain access to our networks, our products and services, supporting technological infrastructure, intellectual property and other assets. we expect these threats to our systems and networks to continue. in addition, we rely on technological infrastructure provided by third-party business partners to support the online functionality of our products and services. these business partners, as well as our channel partners, also are subject to cyber risks and threats. both our partners and we have expended, and expect to continue to expend, financial and operational resources to implement certain systems, processes and technologies to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems. however, the techniques used to exploit, disable, damage, disrupt or gain access to our networks, our products and services, supporting technological infrastructure, intellectual property and other assets change frequently, continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and often are not detected for long periods of time. our systems, processes and technologies, and the systems, processes and technologies of our business partners, may not be adequate against all eventualities. in addition, the costs to respond to, mitigate, and/or notify affected parties of cyber-attacks and other security vulnerabilities are significant. any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks, or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk, could result in a loss of anticipated revenue, interruptions to our products and services, cause us to incur significant remediation and notification costs, degrade the user experience, cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services and significant legal and financial costs. this could harm our business, reputation and brand, disrupt our relationships with partners and customers and diminish our competitive position.
the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse, exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively impact our business. virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency and/or virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service. the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items, including in black markets. our online services have been impacted by in-game exploits and the use of automated or other fraudulent processes to generate virtual item or currency illegitimately, and such activity may continue.  these abuses and exploits, and the steps that we take to address these abuses and exploits may result in a loss of anticipated revenue, increased costs to protect against or remediate these issues, interfere with players' enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause harm to our reputation and brand.
our business could be adversely affected if our consumer protection, data privacy and security practices are not adequate, or perceived as being inadequate, to prevent data breaches, or by the application of consumer protection and data privacy and security laws generally.
in the course of our business, we collect, process, store and use consumer, employee and other information, including personal information, passwords, credit card information gameplay details and banking information. although we expend, and expect to continue to expend, financial and operational resources to create and enforce security measures, policies and controls that are designed to protect this information from improper or unauthorized access, acquisition and misuse and/or the uninformed disclosure, our security measures, policies and controls may not be able successful against all eventualities. the improper or unauthorized access, acquisition or misuse and/or uninformed disclosure of consumer and other information, or a perception that we do not adequately secure this information or provide consumers with adequate notice about the information that they authorize us to disclose, could result in legal liability, costly remedial measures, governmental and regulatory investigations, harm our profitability, reputation and brand, and cause our financial results to be materially affected. in addition, third party vendors and business partners receive access to information that we collect. these vendors and business partners may not prevent data security breaches with respect to the information we provide them or fully enforce our policies, contractual obligations and disclosures regarding the collection, use, storage, transfer and retention of personal data. a data security breach of one of our vendors or business partners could cause reputational and financial harm to them and us, negatively impact our ability to offer our products and services, and could result in legal liability, costly remedial measures, governmental and regulatory investigations, harm our profitability, reputation and brand, and cause our financial results to be materially affected.
we are subject to payment card association rules and obligations pursuant to contracts with payment card processors. under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties. in addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no consumer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.
data privacy, data protection, localization, security and consumer-protection laws are evolving, and the interpretation and application of these laws in the united states, europe and elsewhere often are uncertain, contradictory and changing. for example, recent developments in europe have created compliance uncertainty and increased the complexity of certain transfers of information from europe to the united states. in addition, the european general data protection regulation (gdpr), effective as of may 2018 applies to us because we receive and process the personal data of european union residents. the gdpr contains significant penalties for non-compliance. it is possible that these laws may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us, unforeseen, or otherwise inconsistent with our practices or that we may not adequately adapt our internal policies and/or procedures to evolving regulations, any of which could result in litigation, regulatory investigations and potential legal liability, require us to change our practices in a manner adverse to our business or limit access to our products and services in certain countries. as a result, our reputation and brand may be harmed, we could incur substantial costs, and we could lose both consumers and revenue.
we may experience outages, disruptions or degradations in our services, products and/or technological infrastructure.
the reliable performance of our products and services increasingly depends on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology systems and those of our external service providers, including third-party "cloud" computing services. our games and services are complex software products, and maintaining the sophisticated technological infrastructure required to reliably deliver these games and services is expensive and complex. the reliable delivery and stability of our products and services could be adversely impacted by outages, disruptions, failures or degradations in our network and related infrastructure, as well as in the online platforms or services of key business partners who offer or support our products and services. possible causes of these outages, disruptions, failures or degradations include natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, bugs or other malware or ransomware that may harm our systems. in addition, we occasionally migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments and perform upgrades and maintenance on our systems.
if we were to experience an event that caused a significant system outage, disruption or degradation or if a transition among data centers or service providers or an upgrade or maintenance session encountered unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions, our products and services may not be available to consumers or may not be delivered reliably and stably. as a result, our reputation and brand may be harmed, consumer engagement with our products and services may be reduced, and our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted. we do not have redundancy for all our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities.
as our digital business grows, we will require an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of consumers. we are investing, and expect to continue to invest, in technology, hardware and software to support our business, but it is possible that we may fail to scale effectively and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect the reliable and stable performance of our games and services, therefore negatively impacting engagement, reputation, brand and revenue growth.
negative perceptions about and responses to our brands, products, services and/or business practices may damage our business, and we may incur costs to address concerns.
expectations regarding the quality, performance and integrity of our products and services are high. players may be critical of our brands, products, services, business models and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons, including perceptions about gameplay fun, fairness, game content, features or services, or objections to certain of our business practices. these negative responses may not be foreseeable. we also may not effectively manage these responses because of reasons within or outside of our control. for example, we have included in certain games the ability for players to purchase digital items, including in some instances virtual "packs", "boxes" or "crates" that contain variable digital items. the inclusion of variable digital items in certain of our games has attracted the attention of our community and if the future implementation of these features creates a negative perception of gameplay fairness or other negative perceptions, our reputation and brand could be harmed and our revenue could be negatively impacted. in addition, we have taken actions, including delaying the release of our games and delaying or discontinuing features and services for our games, after taking into consideration, among other things, feedback from our community even if those decisions negatively impacted our operating results in the short term. we expect to continue to take actions to address concerns as appropriate, including actions that may result in additional expenditures and the loss of revenue. negative sentiment about gameplay fairness, our business practices, business models or game content also can lead to investigations or increased scrutiny from governmental bodies and consumer groups, as well as litigation, which, regardless of their outcome, may be costly, damaging to our reputation and harm our business.
our business depends on the success and availability of platforms developed by third parties and our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for those platforms.
the success of our business is driven in part by the commercial success and adequate supply of third party platforms for which we develop our products and services or through which our products and services are distributed. our success also depends on our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace, our ability to develop commercially successful products and services for these platforms, our ability to simultaneously manage products and services on multiple platforms and our ability to effectively transition our products and services to new platforms. we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the commercial availability of new platforms, and we may incur significant expense to adjust our product portfolio and development efforts in response to changing consumer platform preferences. additionally, we may enter into certain exclusive licensing arrangements that affect our ability to deliver or market products or services on certain platforms. a platform for which we are developing products and services may not succeed as expected or new platforms may take market share and interactive entertainment consumers away from platforms for which we have devoted significant resources. if consumer demand for the platforms for which we are developing products and services is lower than our expectations, we may be unable to fully recover the investments we have made in developing our products and services, and our financial performance will be harmed. alternatively, a platform for which we have not devoted significant resources could be more successful than we initially anticipated, causing us to not be able to take advantage of meaningful revenue opportunities.
government regulations applicable to us may negatively impact our business.
we are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet. in addition, laws and regulations relating to user privacy, data collection, retention, consumer protection, content, advertising, localization, and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many jurisdictions and countries throughout the world. these laws could harm our business by limiting the products and services we can offer consumers or the manner in which we offer them. the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. any failure on our part to comply with these laws or the application of these laws in an unanticipated manner may harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability.
certain of our business models could be subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws and regulations. for example, the growth and development of electronic commerce, virtual items and virtual currency has prompted calls for laws and regulations that could limit or restrict the sale of our products and services or otherwise impact our products and services. in addition, we include modes in our games that allow players to compete against each other and manage player competitions that are based on our products and services. although we structure and operate our skill-based competitions with applicable laws in mind, our skill-based competitions in the future could become subject to evolving laws and regulations. new laws related to these business models, or changes in the interpretation of current laws that impact these business models, could subject us to additional regulation and oversight, lessen the engagement with, and growth of, profitable business models, and expose us to increased compliance costs, significant liability, penalties and harm to our reputation and brand.
we are subject to laws in certain foreign countries, and adhere to industry standards in the united states, that mandate rating requirements or set other restrictions on the advertisement or distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content. in addition, certain foreign countries allow government censorship of interactive entertainment software products. adoption of ratings systems, censorship or restrictions on distribution of interactive entertainment software based on content could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers. in addition, compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly, delay or prevent the release of our products in those territories.
we may not meet our product development schedules or key events, sports seasons and/or movies that are tied to our product release schedule to may be delayed, cancelled or poorly received.
our ability to meet product development schedules is affected by a number of factors both within and outside our control, including feedback from our players, the creative processes involved, the coordination of large and sometimes geographically dispersed development teams, the complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed, the need to fine-tune our products prior to their release and, in certain cases, approvals from third parties. we have experienced development delays for our products in the past, which caused us to delay or cancel release dates. we also seek to release certain products in conjunction with key events, such as the beginning of a sports season, major sporting event, or the release of a related movie. if such a key event were delayed, cancelled or poorly received, our sales likely would suffer materially. any failure to meet anticipated production or release schedules likely would result in a delay of revenue and/or possibly a significant shortfall in our revenue, increase our development and/or marketing expenses, harm our profitability, and cause our operating results to be materially different than anticipated.
historically our business has been highly seasonal with the highest percentage of our sales occurring in the quarter ending in december. while we expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2019, there is no assurance that it will be so. if we miss key selling periods for products or services for any reason, including product delays or product cancellations our sales likely will suffer significantly. additionally, macroeconomic conditions or the occurrence of unforeseen events that negatively impact consumer or retailer buying patterns, particularly during the quarter ending in december, likely will harm our financial performance disproportionately.
our marketing and advertising efforts may fail to resonate with consumers.
our products and services are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs, such as online and mobile advertising, television advertising, retail merchandising, marketing through websites, event sponsorship and direct communications with consumers including via email. furthermore, an increasing portion of our marketing activity is taking place on social media platforms that are outside of our direct control. our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs, and changes to consumer preferences, marketing regulations, technology changes or service disruptions may negatively impact our ability to reach our customers. moreover, if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our customers, particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods, or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase, our business and operating results could be harmed.
we may not attract and retain key personnel.
the market for technical, creative, marketing and other personnel essential to the development, marketing and support of our products and services and management of our businesses is extremely competitive. our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting our executives, as well as key creative and technical talent. we may experience significant compensation costs to hire and retain senior executives and other personnel that we deem critical to our success. if we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified employees, or replace key employees following their departure, our ability to develop and manage our business will be impaired.
we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business.
our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature, such as revenue from our annualized titles (e.g., fifa and madden nfl) and associated services, subscriptions and our ongoing mobile businesses. while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games, services and business models, we cannot provide assurances that consumer demand will remain consistent. furthermore, we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature. consumer demand may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our games and services, our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles, our ability to adapt our games and services to new platforms and business models, outages and disruptions of online services, the games and services offered by our competitors, our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns, among others. the reception to our licensed sports games may be adversely impacted by circumstances outside our control impacting the sports leagues and organizations. any decline or fluctuation in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results.
we could fail to successfully adopt new business models.
from time to time we seek to establish and implement new business models. forecasting the success of any new business model is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors both within and outside of our control. our actual revenue and profit for these businesses may be significantly greater or less than our forecasts. in addition, these new business models could fail, resulting in the loss of our investment in the development and infrastructure needed to support these new business models, as well as the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from more successful and established businesses. for example, we have devoted financial and operational resources to our subscription offerings without any assurance that these businesses will be financially successful. while we anticipate growth in this area of our business, consumer demand is difficult to predict as a result of a number of factors, including satisfaction with our products and services, our ability to provide engaging products and services, products and services offered by our competitors, reliability of our infrastructure, pricing, the actual or perceived security of our information technology systems and reductions in consumer spending levels. in addition, if our subscription offerings are successful, sales could be diverted from established business models. if we do not select a target price that is optimal for our subscription services, maintain our target pricing structure or correctly project renewal rates, our financial results may be harmed.
acquisitions, investments, divestitures and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and other negative consequences.
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions including (1) acquisitions of companies, businesses, intellectual properties, and other assets, (2) minority investments in strategic partners, and (3) investments in new interactive entertainment businesses as part of our long-term business strategy. these transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that we acquire liabilities, that our due diligence process does not identify significant issues, liabilities or other challenges, diversion of management's attention from our other businesses, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, write-offs of goodwill, intangibles, or acquired in-process technology, or other increased cash and non-cash expenses. in addition, we may not integrate these businesses successfully, for example with difficulties with the integration of business systems and technologies, the integration and retention of new employees, the implementation or remediation of the internal control environment of the acquired entity, or the maintenance of key business and customer relationships. these events could harm our operating results or financial condition. we also may divest or sell assets or a business and we may have difficulty selling such assets or business on acceptable terms in a timely manner. this could result in a delay in the achievement of our strategic objectives, cause us to incur additional expense, or the sale of such assets or business at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we anticipated.
many of our products and services are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others. for example, our ea sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players' associations and our star wars products include rights licensed from disney. competition for these licenses and rights is intense. if we are unable to maintain these licenses and rights or obtain additional licenses or rights with significant commercial value, our ability to develop and successful and engaging games and services may be adversely affected and our revenue, profitability and cash flows may decline significantly. competition for these licenses also may increase the amounts that we must pay to licensors and developers, through higher minimum guarantees or royalty rates, which could significantly increase our costs and reduce our profitability.
we rely on the platforms of our channel partners who have significant influence over the products and services that we offer on their platforms.
a significant percentage of our digital net revenue is attributable to sales of products and services through our significant channel partners, including sony, microsoft, nintendo, apple and google. the concentration of a material portion of our digital sales in these channel partners exposes us to risks associated with these businesses. any deterioration in the businesses of our channel partners could disrupt and harm our business, including by limiting the channels through which our digital products and services are offered and exposing us to collection risks.
in addition, our license agreements with our channel partners typically give them significant control over the approval, manufacturing and distribution of the products and services that we develop for their platform. in particular, our arrangements with sony and microsoft could, in certain circumstances, leave us unable to get our products and services approved, manufactured or distributed to customers. for our digital products and services delivered via digital channels maintained by, among others, sony,
microsoft, nintendo, apple and google, each respective channel partner has policies and guidelines that control the promotion and distribution of these titles and the features and functionalities that we are permitted to offer through the channel. in addition, we are dependent on our channel partners to invest in, and upgrade, digital commerce capabilities in a manner than corresponds to the way in which consumers purchase our products and services. failure by our channels partners to keep pace with consumer preferences could have an adverse impact on our ability to merchandise and commercialize our products and services which could harm our business and/or financial results.
moreover, certain of our channel partners can determine and change unilaterally certain key terms and conditions, including the ability to change their user and developer policies and guidelines. in many cases our channel partners also set the rates that we must pay to provide our games and services through their online channels, and retain flexibility to change their fee structures or adopt different fee structures for their online channels, which could adversely impact our costs, profitability and margins. in addition, our channel partners control the information technology systems through which online sales of our products and service channels are captured. if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels, significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers, or their information technology systems fail or cause an unanticipated delay in reporting, our business and/or financial results could be materially affected.
our business is subject to risks generally associated with the entertainment industry.
our business is subject to risks that are generally associated with the entertainment industry, many of which are beyond our control. these risks could negatively impact our operating results and include: the popularity, price and timing of our games, economic conditions that adversely affect discretionary consumer spending, changes in consumer demographics, the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment, and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences, which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted.
our business partners may be unable to honor their obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk.
we rely on various business partners, including third-party service providers, vendors, licensing partners, development partners, and licensees in many areas of our business. their actions may put our business and our reputation and brand at risk. for example, we may have disputes with our business partners that may impact our business and/or financial results. in many cases, our business partners may be given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support to our teams, and they may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it. in addition, the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, or the failure of the third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies, could result in a disruption to our business operations. further, disruptions in the financial markets, economic downturns, poor business decisions, or reputational harm may adversely affect our business partners and they may not be able to continue honoring their obligations to us or we may cease our arrangements with them. alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner or vendor. if we lose one or more significant business partners, our business could be harmed and our financial results could be materially affected.
our products and services are extremely complex software programs, and are difficult to develop and distribute. we have quality controls in place to detect defects, bugs or other errors in our products and services before they are released. nonetheless, these quality controls are subject to human error, overriding, and reasonable resource or technical constraints. therefore, these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective in detecting all defects, bugs or errors in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace. in such an event, the technological reliability and stability of our products and services could be below our standards and the standards of consumers and our reputation, brand and sales could be adversely affected. in addition, we could be required to, or may find it necessary to, offer a refund for the product or service, suspend the availability or sale of the product or service or expend significant resources to cure the defect, bug or error each of which could significantly harm our business and operating results.
from time to time, third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. for example, patent holding companies may assert patent claims against us in which they seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement.
existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be expensive to defend and divert the attention of our employees from business operations. such claims or litigation could require us to pay damages and other costs. we also could be required to stop selling, distributing or supporting products, features or services which incorporate the affected intellectual property rights, redesign products, features or services to avoid infringement, or obtain a license, all of which could be costly and harm our business.
in addition, many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering, playing or monetizing interactive entertainment software products and services, such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future. we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery to consumers may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to license on reasonable terms.
we are currently, and from time to time in the future may become, subject to legal proceedings, claims, litigation and government investigations or inquiries, which could be expensive, lengthy, disruptive to normal business operations and occupy a significant amount of our employees' time and attention. in addition, the outcome of any legal proceedings, claims, litigation, investigations or inquiries may be difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
our products and brands are subject to the threat of piracy, unauthorized copying and other forms of intellectual property infringement.
we regard our products and brands as proprietary and take measures to protect our products, brands and other confidential information from infringement. we are aware that some unauthorized copying of our products and brands occurs, and if a significantly greater amount were to occur, it could negatively impact our business.
piracy and other forms of unauthorized copying and use of our content and brands are persistent problems for us, and policing is difficult. further, the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states, or are poorly enforced. legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries. in addition, although we take steps to enforce and police our rights, factors such as the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used by our business partners or by us, the availability of broadband access to the internet, the refusal of internet service providers or platform holders to remove infringing content in certain instances, and the proliferation of online channels through which infringing product is distributed all have contributed to an expansion in unauthorized copying of our products and brands.
we may experience outages, disruptions and/or degradations of our infrastructure.
we may experience outrages, disruptions and/or degradations of our infrastructure, including information technology system failures and network disruptions. these may be caused by natural disasters, cyber-incidents, weather events, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, failed upgrades of existing systems or migrations to new systems, acts of terrorism or other events, including cyber-attacks or malicious software programs that exploit vulnerabilities. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. such failures or disruptions could prevent access to our products, services or online stores selling our products and services or interruption in our ability to conduct critical business functions.  our corporate headquarters in redwood city, ca and our studios in los angeles, california, seattle, washington and in burnaby, british columbia are located in seismically active regions, and certain of our game development activities and other essential business operations are conducted at these locations. an event that results in the disruption or degradation of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and materially impact our reputation and brand, financial condition and operating results.
we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue attributable to sales of our packaged goods products to our top retail and distribution partners. the concentration of a significant percentage of these sales through a few large partners could lead to a short-term disruption to our business if certain of these partners significantly reduced their purchases or ceased to offer our products. we also could be more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these partners experienced a deterioration of their business or declared bankruptcy. additionally, receivables from these partners generally increase in our december fiscal quarter as sales of our products generally increase in anticipation of the holiday season. having a significant portion of our packaged goods sales
concentrated in a few partners could reduce our negotiating leverage with them. if one or more of these partners experience deterioration in their business, or become unable to obtain sufficient financing to maintain their operations, our business could be harmed.
external game developers may not meet product development schedules or otherwise honor their obligations.
we may contract with external game developers to develop our games or to publish or distribute their games. while we maintain contractual protections, we have less control over the product development schedules of games developed by external developers, and we depend on their ability to meet product development schedules. in addition, we may have disputes with external developers over game content, launch timing, achievement of certain milestones, the game development timeline, marketing campaigns or other matters. if we have disputes with external developers or they cannot meet product development schedules, acquire certain approvals or are otherwise unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to us, we may delay or cancel previously announced games, alter our launch schedule or experience increased costs and expenses, which could result in a delay or significant shortfall in anticipated revenue, harm our profitability and reputation, and cause our financial results to be materially affected.
our financial results are subject to currency fluctuations.
international sales are a fundamental part of our business. for our fiscal year ended march 31, 2018, international net revenue comprised 59 percent of our total net revenue, and we expect our international business to continue to account for a significant portion of our total net revenue. as a result of our international sales, and also the denomination of our foreign investments and our cash and cash equivalents in foreign currencies, we are exposed to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. strengthening of the u.s. dollar, particularly relative to the euro, british pound sterling, australian dollar, chinese yuan and south korean won, has a negative impact on our reported international net revenue but a positive impact on our reported international operating expenses (particularly when the u.s. dollar strengthens against the swedish krona and the canadian dollar) because these amounts are translated at lower rates. we use foreign currency hedging contracts to mitigate some foreign currency risk. however, these activities are limited in the protection they provide us from foreign currency fluctuations and can themselves result in losses.
we utilize debt financing and such indebtedness could adversely impact our business and financial condition.
we have $1 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding as well as an unsecured committed $500 million revolving credit facility. while the facility is currently undrawn, we may use the proceeds of any future borrowings for general corporate purposes. we may also enter into other financial instruments in the future.
our indebtedness could affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:
•   requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and
•   increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions.
the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. in particular, the revolving credit facility includes a maximum capitalization ratio and minimum liquidity requirements. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with any potential refinancing our indebtedness. downgrades in our credit rating could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing.
changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.
we are subject to taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision, tax assets, and accruals for other taxes, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. our effective income tax rate is based in part on our corporate operating structure and the manner in which we operate our business and develop, value and use our intellectual property. taxing authorities in
jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for calculating our income tax provision or its underlying assumptions, which could increase our effective income tax rate and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. in addition, our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by our profit levels, changes in our business, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the elections we make, changes in applicable tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws, or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as other factors.
the tax cuts and jobs act (the "u.s. tax act"), enacted on december 22, 2017, represents a significant overhaul to the u.s. federal tax code. this tax legislation lowers the u.s. statutory tax rate, but also includes a number of provisions that could significantly and adversely impact our u.s. federal income tax position in a reporting period, including the limitation or elimination of certain deductions or credits, and u.s. taxes on foreign earnings.  the final calculation of tax expense resulting from the u.s. tax act may differ from our estimates, potentially materially. in addition, any further changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals in the countries in which we do business could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cause us to change the way in which we structure our business or result in other costs.
we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions. furthermore, we are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities with respect to both income and such other non-income taxes. unfavorable audit results or tax rulings, or other changes resulting in significant additional tax liabilities, could have material adverse effects upon our earnings, cash flows, and financial condition.
our reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards.
our reported financial results are impacted by the accounting standards promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. these methods, estimates, and judgments are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes that could adversely affect our reported financial position and financial results. in addition, changes to applicable financial accounting standards could adversely affect our reported financial position and financial results. for example, asu 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which is effective for us at the beginning of fiscal 2019, will materially change the way in which we recognize revenue and will require us to change how we report mobile platform fees. for more information on asu 2014-09 and other accounting standards, see part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 1 - description of business and basis of presentation under the subheading "impact of recently issued accounting standards".
as we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue, costs and taxes, could have an adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows.
the market price of our common stock historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us (including those discussed in the risk factors above, as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material), to changes in securities analysts' earnings estimates or ratings, to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts' and investors' expectations, to factors affecting the entertainment, computer, software, internet, media or electronics industries, to our ability to successfully integrate any acquisitions we may make, or to national or international economic conditions. in particular, economic downturns may contribute to the public stock markets experiencing extreme price and trading volume volatility. these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a high-level discussion of our operating results, as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business. management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers provides important context for our results for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2018, as well as our future prospects. this summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form 10-k, including in the "business" section and the "risk factors" above, the remainder of this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a")", and the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
about electronic arts we are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment, with a mission to inspire the world to play. we develop, market, publish and deliver games and services that can be played on a variety of platforms, including game consoles, pcs, mobile phones and tablets. in our games and services, we use brands that we either wholly own (such as battlefield, mass effect, the sims and plants v. zombies), or license from others (such as fifa, madden nfl and star wars). we develop and publish games and services across diverse genres such as sports, first-person shooter, action, role-playing and simulation. we believe that the breadth and depth of our portfolio gives us the opportunity to engage an increasing number of players across more platforms and geographies and through more business models.
financial results our key financial results for our fiscal year ended march 31, 2018 were as follows:
•   digital revenue was $3,450 million, up 20 percent year-over-year.
•   total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5,331 million.
from time to time, we make comparisons of current periods to prior periods with reference to constant currency. constant currency comparisons are based on translating local currency amounts in the current period at actual foreign exchange rates from the prior comparable period. we evaluate our financial performance on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons without regard to the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates.
trends in our business digital business. players increasingly purchase our games as digital downloads, as opposed to purchasing physical discs, and engage with the live services we provide on an ongoing basis. our live services provide additional depth and engagement opportunities for our players and include microtransactions, extra content, subscriptions, and esports. our net revenue attributable to live services comprised 40 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2018 and we expect that live services net revenue will continue to be material to our business. our most popular live service is the ultimate team mode associated with our sports franchises. ultimate team allows players to collect and trade current and former professional players in order to build and compete as a personalized team. net revenue from ultimate team represented approximately 21 percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year 2018, a substantial portion of which was derived from fifa ultimate team. our digital transformation is also creating opportunities in platforms, business models and the way in which players engage with our games and services. for example, we have leveraged brands and assets from franchises typically associated with consoles and traditional pc gaming, such as fifa, madden nfl, the sims, simcity and star wars, to create mobile and pc games that are monetized through live services associated with the game. we also provide our ea access and origin access subscription services, which offer players access to a selection of ea games and other benefits for a monthly or annual fee.
we significantly increased our digital net revenue from $2,409 million in fiscal year 2016 to $2,874 million in fiscal year 2017 and $3,450 million during fiscal year 2018. we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow through fiscal year 2019 and beyond as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally.
technological infrastructure. as our digital business has grown, our games and services increasingly depend on the reliability, availability and security of our technological infrastructure. we are investing and expect to continue to invest in technology, hardware and software to support our games and services, including with respect to security protections. our industry is prone to, and our systems and networks are subject to, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, worms, phishing attacks, malicious software programs, and other information security incidents that seek to exploit, disable, damage, disrupt or gain access to our networks, our products and services, supporting technological infrastructure, intellectual property and other assets. we expect these threats to our systems and networks to continue.
player network. we have made, and expect to continue to make, investments that strengthen our player network, which connects our players to each other and to the games they love. we are adopting consistent, cross-company methodologies to better understand our players' needs and will continue to invest in technology that enables us to build personalized player relationships that can last for years instead of days or weeks by connecting our players to us and to each other. this connection allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like fifa, battlefield and star wars to our players more efficiently. that same foundation also enables new player-centric ways to discover and try new games and experiences, such as our subscription-based ea access and origin access services.
concentration of sales among the most popular games. in all major segments of our industry, we see a large portion of games sales concentrated on the most popular titles. similarly, a significant portion of our revenue historically has been derived from games based on a few popular franchises, several of which we have released on an annual or bi-annual basis. in particular, we have historically derived a significant portion of our net revenue from our largest and most popular game, fifa, the annualized version of which is consistently one of the best-selling games in the marketplace.
mobile and pc free-to-download games. the global adoption of mobile devices and a business model for those devices that allows consumers to try new games with no up-front cost, and that are monetized through the live service associated with the game, has led to significant growth in the mobile gaming industry. we expect this growth to continue during our 2019 fiscal year. likewise, the wide consumer acceptance of free-to-download, live service-based pc games played over the internet has broadened our consumer base. we expect revenue generated from mobile and pc free-to-download games to remain an important part of our business.
recurring revenue sources. our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature, such as revenue from our annualized titles (such as fifa and madden nfl) and associated live services, subscriptions and our ongoing mobile business. we have been able to forecast revenue from these areas of our business with greater relative confidence than for new games, services and business models. as we continue to leverage the digital transformation in our industry and incorporate new content models and modalities of play into our games, our goal is to continue to look for opportunities to expand the recurring portion of our business.
net bookings. in order to improve transparency into our business, we disclose an operating performance metric, net bookings. net bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically in the period. net
bookings is calculated by adding total net revenue to the change in deferred net revenue for online-enabled games, and, for periods after the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, excluding mobile platform fees.
the following is a calculation of our total net bookings for the periods presented:
change in deferred net revenue (online-enabled games)          30                    97
net bookings were $5,180 million for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2018, driven by fifa 18, fifa ultimate team, star wars battlefront ii, and madden nfl 18. net bookings increased $238 million or 5 percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2017 due primarily to growth in bookings associated with the ultimate team game mode. digital net bookings were $3,538 million for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2018, an increase of $504 million or 17 percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march 31, 2017. the increase in digital net bookings was driven by growth in live services which grew $514 million or 31 percent year-over-year, primarily due to growth in bookings associated with the ultimate team game mode and sales of the sims 4; and our mobile business which grew $31 million or 5 percent year-over-year, primarily due to fifa mobile. these increases were offset by a decrease of $41 million or 6 percent in our full game downloads. full game downloads of fifa 18 showed strength in fiscal 2018, but were offset by the success of battlefield 1 in fiscal 2017.
recent developments stock repurchase program. in may 2018, a special committee of our board of directors, on behalf of the full board of directors, authorized a program to repurchase up to $2.4 billion of our common stock. this stock repurchase program supersedes and replaces the stock repurchase program approved in may 2017, and expires on may 31, 2020. under this program, we may purchase stock in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, including pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans. the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price, capital availability, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. we are not obligated to repurchase a specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. we are actively repurchasing shares under this program.
acquisition of respawn llc. on december 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of respawn. respawn is a leading game development studio and creators of games including the critically-acclaimed titanfall franchise. in connection with the acquisition, we paid $151 million in cash. in addition, we granted long-term equity awards in the form of restricted stock units to employees with a grant date fair value of $167 million. furthermore, we may be required to pay variable cash consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance milestones relating to the development of future titles, through the end of calendar 2022. the additional consideration is limited to a maximum of $140 million.
u.s. tax act. on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (the "u.s. tax act") was enacted which significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the u.s. corporate income tax rates to 21 percent, generally implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the "transition tax"). we recorded a provisional $235 million tax charge during the year ended march 31, 2018 as a result of the application of the u.s. tax act; $192 million of which relates to the transition tax.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("u.s. gaap"). the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown. as a result, actual results may differ materially from our estimates.
revenue recognition, and sales returns and allowances we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games, and related content and services on game consoles, pcs, mobile phones and tablets. we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in fasb accounting standards codification ("asc") 605, revenue recognition and asc 985-605, software: revenue recognition. we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue.
product revenue. our product revenue includes revenue associated with the sale of software games or related product content or updates, whether delivered digitally (e.g., full-game downloads, extra-content) or via a physical disc (e.g., packaged goods), and licensing of game software to third-parties. product revenue also includes revenue from mobile full game downloads that do not require our hosting support (e.g., premium mobile games) in order to utilize the game or related content (i.e. can be played with or without an internet connection), and sales of tangible products such as hardware, peripherals, or collectors' items.
service and other revenue. our service revenue includes revenue recognized from time-based subscriptions, games, content or updates that requires our hosting support in order to utilize the game or related content (i.e., can only be played with an internet connection). this includes (1) entitlements to content that are accessed through hosting services (e.g., microtransactions for internet-based, social network and free-to-download mobile games), (2) massively multi-player online ("mmo") games (both software game and subscription sales), (3) subscriptions for our battlefield premium, ea and origin access, and pogo-branded online game services, and (4) allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a service of online activities (e.g., online playability). our other revenue includes advertising and non-software licensing revenue.
with respect to the allocated service revenue from sales of software games with a service of online activities ("online services") mentioned above, our allocation of proceeds between product and service revenue for presentation purposes is based on management's best estimate of the selling price of the online services with the residual value allocated to product revenue. our estimate of the selling price of the online services are comprised of several factors including, but not limited to, prior selling prices for the online services, prices charged separately by other third-party vendors for similar service offerings, and a cost-plus-margin approach. we review the estimated selling price of the online services on a regular basis and use this methodology consistently to allocate revenue between product and service for software game sales with online services.
we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met:
•   evidence of an arrangement. evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver the related products or services must be present.
•   collection is deemed probable. collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due. if we determine that collection is not probable as the amounts become due, we generally conclude that collection becomes probable upon cash collection.
•   delivery. for packaged goods, delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer. for digital downloads, delivery is considered to occur when the software is made available to the customer for download. for services and other, delivery is generally considered to occur as the service is delivered, which is determined based on the underlying service obligation. if there is significant uncertainty of acceptance, revenue is recognized once acceptance is reasonably assured.
online-enabled games the majority of our software games and related content have online connectivity whereby a consumer may be able to download unspecified content or updates on a when-and-if-available basis ("unspecified updates") for use with the original game software. in addition, we may also offer a service of online activities (e.g., online playability) without a separate fee. u.s. gaap requires us to account for the consumer's right to receive unspecified updates or the service of online activities for no additional fee as a "bundled" sale, or multiple-element arrangement.
we have an established historical pattern of providing unspecified updates (e.g., player roster updates to madden nfl 18) to online-enabled games and related content at no additional charge to the consumer. because we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ("vsoe") for these unspecified updates, we are required by current u.s. gaap to recognize as
revenue the entire sales price of these online-enabled games and related content over the period we expect to offer the unspecified updates to the consumer ("estimated offering period").
estimated offering period because the offering period is not an explicitly defined period, we must make an estimate of the offering period. determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage. for example, in determining the estimated offering period for unspecified updates associated with our online-enabled games, we consider the period of time consumers are online as online connectivity is required. on an annual basis, we review consumers' online gameplay of all online-enabled games that have been released 12 to 24 months prior to the evaluation date. for example, if our evaluation date is april 1, 2017, we evaluate all online-enabled games released between april 1, 2015 and march 31, 2016. based on this population of games, for all players that register the game online within the first six months of release of the game to the general public, we compute the weighted-average number of days for each online-enabled game, based on when a player initially registers the game online to when that player last plays the game online. we then compute the weighted-average number of days for all online-enabled games by multiplying the weighted-average number of days for each online-enabled game by its relative percentage of total units sold from these online-enabled games (i.e., a game with more units sold will have a higher weighting to the overall computation than a game with fewer units sold). under a similar computation, we also consider the estimated period of time between the date a game unit is sold to a reseller and the date the reseller sells the game unit to an end consumer (i.e., time in channel). based on these two calculations we then consider the method of distribution. for example, physical software games sold at retail would have a composite offering period equal to the online gameplay plus time in channel as opposed to digitally distributed software games which are delivered immediately via digital download and thus have no concept of channel. additionally, we consider results from prior analyses, known and expected online gameplay trends, as well as disclosed service periods for competitors' games in determining the estimated offering period for future sales.
while we consistently apply this methodology, inherent assumptions used in this methodology include which online-enabled games to sample, whether to use only units that have registered online, whether to weight the number of days for each game, whether to weight the days based on the units sold of each game, determining the period of time between the date of sale to reseller and the date of sale to the consumer and assessing online gameplay trends.
we recognize revenue from the sale of online-enabled games for which we do not have vsoe for the unspecified updates on a straight-line basis, generally over an estimated nine-month period beginning in the month after shipment for physical games sold through retail and an estimated six-month period for digitally-distributed games.
because the majority of our sales are subject to a deferral period of generally six to nine months, our deferred net revenue (online-enabled games) balance is material. this balance increases from period to period by the revenue being deferred for current sales and is reduced by the recognition of revenue from prior sales that were deferred (i.e., the "net change" in the deferred balance). however, given the seasonal sales nature of our business, the net change in the deferred balance may be material from period to period. for example, because our sales have historically been highest in the fiscal third quarter, the deferred net revenue (online-enabled games) balance generally increases significantly in the third fiscal quarter. similarly, because sales have historically been lowest in the first fiscal quarter, the deferred net revenue (online-enabled games) balance generally decreases significantly in the first fiscal quarter of a fiscal year.
other multiple-element arrangements in some of our multiple-element arrangements, we sell non-software products with software and/or software-related offerings. these non-software products are generally music soundtracks, peripherals or ancillary collectors' items, such as figurines and comic books. revenue for these arrangements is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below. if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable.
we determine the selling price for a non-software product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy: vsoe (i.e., the price we charge when the non-software product is sold separately) if available, third-party evidence ("tpe") of fair value (i.e., the price charged by others for similar non-software products) if vsoe is not available, or our best estimate of selling price ("besp") if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, recent selling prices and related discounts, market conditions, customer classes,
sales channels and other factors. provided the other three revenue recognition criteria other than delivery have been met, we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer as we have no further obligations.
we must make assumptions and judgments in order to (1) determine whether and when each element is delivered, (2) determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element, and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements, as applicable. changes to any of these assumptions and judgments, or changes to the elements in the arrangement, could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
principal agent considerations we evaluate sales of our interactive software games, extra-content, and services from our subscription offerings via third party storefronts, including digital channel storefronts from microsoft, sony, apple, and google, in order to determine whether or not we are acting as the primary obligor in the sale to the end consumer, which we consider in determining if revenue should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net treatment include but are not limited to the following:
•   the party responsible for delivery/fulfillment of the product or service to the end consumer
•   the party responsible for the billing, collection of fees and refunds to the end consumer
•   the storefront and terms of sale that govern the end consumer's purchase of the product or service
•   the party that sets the pricing with the end consumer and has credit risk based on evaluation of the above indicators, we have determined that generally the third party is considered the primary obligor to end consumers for the sale of our interactive software games. we therefore report revenue related to these arrangements net of the fees retained by the storefront.
sales returns and allowances we reduce revenue for estimated future returns and price protection which may occur with our distributors and retailers ("channel partners"). price protection represents our practice to provide our channel partners with a credit allowance to lower their wholesale price on a particular product that they have not resold to end consumers. the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old wholesale price and the new reduced wholesale price. in certain countries for our pc and console packaged goods software products, we also have a practice of allowing channel partners to return older software products in the channel in exchange for a credit allowance. as a general practice, we do not give cash refunds.
when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances, we analyze the following: historical credit allowances, current sell-through of our channel partners' inventory of our software products, current trends in retail and the video game industry, changes in customer demand, acceptance of our software products, and other related factors. in addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories, as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection in subsequent periods.
in the future, actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing software products. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection allowances would change and would impact the total net revenue and related balance sheet accounts that we report.
fair value estimates business combinations. we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities and contingencies assumed, acquired in-process technology, and contingent consideration issued in a business combination. our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives. furthermore, the estimated fair value assigned to an acquired asset or liability has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is not amortized. determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows. determining the fair value of acquired in-process technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that technology. determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability. determining the fair value of contingent consideration requires an assessment of the probability-weighted expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled, and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation. the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration payable are forecasted earnings. significant changes in forecasted earnings would
result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination. such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to (1) content licensors, (2) independent software developers, and (3) co-publishing and distribution affiliates. license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities, professional sports organizations, movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks, copyrights, personal publicity rights, content and/or other intellectual property. royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games. co-publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products.
royalty-based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid. these royalty-based obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums. significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract. because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue, it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors, including (1) the total number of titles subject to the contract, (2) the timing of the release of these titles, (3) the number of software units and amount of extra content that we expect to sell, which can be impacted by a number of variables, including product quality, number of platforms we release on, the timing of the title's release and competition, and (4) future pricing. determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products. furthermore, if we conclude that we are unable to make a reasonably reliable forecast of projected net revenue, we recognize royalty expense at the greater of contract rate or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. accordingly, if our future revenue projections change, our effective royalty rates would change, which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize.
prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co-publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product, and therefore, we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product. accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred. payments due after completion of the product (primarily royalty-based in nature) are generally expensed as cost of revenue.
our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments, which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor. when performance remains with the licensor, we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred, rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract.
each quarter, we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royalty-based assets, as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product and service sales. any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are generally charged to research and development expense. impairments or losses determined post-launch are charged to cost of revenue. we evaluate long-lived royalty-based assets for impairment using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist. if impairment exists, then the assets are written down to fair value. unrecognized minimum royalty-based commitments are accounted for as executory contracts, and therefore, any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned (i.e., cease use) or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both (1) the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and (2) the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. in making this determination, we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified.
in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income, we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets, namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, the carryback of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law, and the implementation of tax planning
strategies. evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments. each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence; this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we realized significant u.s. pre-tax income for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016. as a result, we released the valuation allowance against all of the u.s. federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the u.s. state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. we continue to maintain a valuation allowance related to specific u.s. state deferred tax assets and foreign capital loss carryovers, due to uncertainty about the future realization of these assets.
our effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes for the year ended march 31, 2018 were significantly impacted by the u.s. tax act enacted on december 22, 2017. the u.s. tax act significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, generally implementing a territorial tax system and imposing the transition tax.
reasonable estimates of the impacts of the u.s. tax act are provided in accordance with sec guidance that allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the u.s. tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. we expect to complete the accounting under the u.s. tax act as soon as practicable, but in no event later than one year from the enactment date of the u.s. tax act.
the final calculations of tax expenses and tax benefits resulting from the u.s. tax act may differ from our estimates, potentially materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the u.s. tax act, our further analysis of the u.s. tax act, or any updates or changes to estimates that we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts.
prior to the u.s. tax act, a substantial majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were considered to be indefinitely reinvested. the u.s. tax act included a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, substantially all previously unremitted earnings for which no u.s. deferred tax liability had been accrued have now been subject to u.s. tax.
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate. these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation, as well as with respect to other matters, such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities. the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations. in addition, changes in our business, including acquisitions, changes in our international corporate structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix and amount of income, as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities, valuation allowances, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate.
impact of recently issued accounting standards the information under the subheading "impact of recently issued accounting standards" in note 1 - description of business and basis of presentation to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k is incorporated by reference into this item 7.

cost of product revenue decreased by $71 million, or 8 percent in fiscal year 2018, as compared to fiscal year 2017. this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in inventory costs associated with battlefield 1 and titanfall 2 which were launched during the fiscal year 2017, a decrease in inventory and warehouse operations costs as a result of the closure of our switzerland distribution business in fiscal year 2017, and a $25 million decrease in intangible amortization primarily due to the recognition of a $15 million impairment charge on an acquisition-related intangible asset during the fiscal year 2017. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the royalty costs associated with our product launches during the fiscal year 2018, as compared to fiscal year 2017.

income taxes provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in millions):
our effective tax rate for the year ended march 31, 2018 was 28.0 percent as compared 20.1 percent for the same period in fiscal year 2017. our effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2018 was significantly impacted by the u.s. tax act. the u.s. tax act significantly revised the u.s. corporate income tax system by, among other things, lowering the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, generally implementing a territorial tax system and imposing the transition tax. these impacts were offset by earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates and the recognition of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
our effective tax rates for fiscal year 2019 and future periods will continue to depend on a variety of factors, including changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions, changes in our international structure, changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets, changes in the geographic mix of income, changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities, applicable accounting rules, applicable tax laws and regulations, rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audit and other matters, and variations in our annual pre-tax income or loss. we anticipate that the impact of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies may result in significant fluctuations to our effective tax rate in the future.
reasonable estimates of the impacts of the u.s. tax act are provided in accordance with sec guidance that allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the u.s. tax act to finalize the recording of the related tax
impacts. we expect to complete the accounting under the u.s. tax act as soon as practicable, but in no event later than one year from the enactment date of the u.s. tax act.
we recorded a provisional tax expense of $235 million related to the u.s. tax act for the year ended march 31, 2018, $192 million of which relates to the transition tax. during the three months ended march 31, 2018, we adjusted the provisional amount initially recorded for the transition tax by recognizing an additional $41 million charge. we also recorded immaterial adjustments to certain other tax items. these adjustments were based on our further analysis of the u.s. tax act and certain changes to current year earnings estimates and assertions. these amounts remain provisional. the final calculation of taxes attributable to the u.s. tax act may differ from our estimates, potentially materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the u.s. tax act, our further analysis of the u.s. tax act, or any updates or changes to estimates that we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts.
the u.s. tax act creates new u.s. taxes on foreign earnings. our provision for income taxes for the year ended march 31, 2018 provisionally does not reflect any deferred tax impacts of the u.s. taxes on foreign earnings. because of the complexity of the rules regarding the new tax on foreign earnings, we are continuing to evaluate this accounting policy election.
net revenue for fiscal year 2017, net revenue was $4,845 million and increased $449 million, or 10 percent, as compared to fiscal year 2016. this increase was driven by an $809 million increase in revenue primarily from the star wars, battlefield, and fifa franchises. this increase was partially offset by a $360 million decrease in revenue primarily from the dragon age, the sims, and nhl franchises, and the simpsons tapped out.

cost of product revenue cost of product revenue decreased by $45 million, or 4.8 percent in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016. this decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in licensing costs as a result of a change in mix of our titles (i.e. star wars battlefront was a fiscal 2016 title that had royalties associated with it while battlefield 1 was a fiscal 2017 title that does not bear royalties). this was partially offset by the recognition of a $15 million impairment charge on an acquisition-related intangible asset, as well an increase in royalty costs associated with fifa 17 and titanfall 2.
cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue decreased by $11 million, or 2.6 percent in fiscal year 2017, as compared to fiscal year 2016. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in inventory costs due to the launch of need for speed 2015 during fiscal year
2016 without a comparable service game launch during fiscal year 2017, partially offset by the recognition of a $10 million impairment charge on a royalty-based asset, and an increase in royalty costs associated with fifa ultimate team and star wars: galaxy of heroes during fiscal year 2017.

in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we realized significant u.s. pre-tax income for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016. as a result, we released the valuation allowance against all of the u.s. federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the u.s. state deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. accordingly, we recorded a $453 million income tax benefit in fiscal year 2016 for the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance.

operating activities. in fiscal 2018, we delivered net revenue of $5.2 billion, cost of revenue of $1.3 billion, and operating income of $1.4 billion, which enabled us to record operating cash flow of $1.692 billion. cash provided by operating activities increased $114 million during fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. the increase is primarily driven by a $111 million increase in accounts receivable collections due to growth in sales associated with the ultimate team game mode and the collections from mass effect: andromeda that was launched at the end of fiscal year 2017, partially offset by the live services sales at the end of fiscal year 2018 that will be collected in the beginning of fiscal year 2019.
investing activities. cash provided by investing activities increased $1,381 million during fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily driven by a $1,885 million increase in proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments as a result of repositioning such investments in order to make offshore funds available for repatriation. this was partially offset by a $370 million decrease in the purchase of short-term investments and a payment of $150 million in connection with the acquisition of respawn.
financing activities. cash used in financing activities decreased $86 million during fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to the repayment of $163 million of our formerly outstanding convertible notes in fiscal year 2017 without a corresponding transaction in fiscal year 2018, offset by a $93 million increase in the repurchase and retirement of our common stock in the current year.
operating activities. cash provided by operating activities increased $113 million during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. the increase is primarily driven by a $385 million increase in sales related to fifa 17, battlefield 1, and titanfall 2. this was partially offset by a $263 million decrease associated with a net increase in accounts receivable balances as of march 31, 2017 as compared to march 31, 2016 primarily due to the timing of game launches and higher digital sales during the three months ended march 31, 2017.
investing activities. cash used in investing activities increased $275 million during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily driven by a $585 million increase in the purchase of short-term investments and a $30 million increase in capital expenditures. this was partially offset by a $340 million increase in proceeds from the sales and maturities of short-term investments.
financing activities. cash used in financing activities increased $181 million during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to the issuance of senior notes for $989 million offset by the repurchases of our common stock for $510 million, both of which occurred during fiscal 2016. also, we had a $35 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a $26 million decrease in taxes paid for shares withheld from employees, which were offset by a $307 million decrease in repayments related to our convertible notes during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016.
short-term investments due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities, our short-term investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in short-term interest rates. as of march 31, 2018, our short-term investments had gross unrealized losses of $9 million, or less than 1 percent of the total in short-term investments, and gross unrealized gains of less than $1 million, or less than 1 percent of the total in short-term investments. from time to time, we may liquidate some or all of our short-term investments to fund operational needs or other activities, such as capital expenditures, business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs.
senior notes in february 2016, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes and $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 notes. we used the net proceeds of $989 million for general corporate purposes, including the payment of our formerly outstanding convertible notes and repurchases of our common stock. the effective interest rate is 3.94% for the 2021 notes and 4.97% for the 2026 notes. interest is payable semiannually in arrears, on march 1 and september 1 of each year. see note 11 - financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10-k as it relates to our senior notes, which is incorporated by reference into this item 7.

financial condition we believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months, including working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt repayment obligations, stock repurchases, and potentially, future acquisitions, or strategic investments. we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to repay debt, strengthen our financial position, facilitate expansion, repurchase our stock, pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, and/or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. there can be no assurance, however, that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.
as of march 31, 2018, approximately $3.7 billion of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions. as a result of the u.s. tax act, which generally implemented a territorial tax system, a substantial portion of this amount is available for repatriation.
in may 2018, a special committee of our board of directors, on behalf of the full board of directors, authorized a program to repurchase up to $2.4 billion of our common stock. this stock repurchase program supersedes and replaces the may 2017 program described below, and expires on may 31, 2020. under this program, we may purchase stock in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws, including pursuant to pre-arranged stock trading plans. the timing and actual amount of the stock repurchases will depend on several factors including price, capital availability, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. we are not obligated to repurchase a specific number of shares under this program and it may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. we are actively repurchasing shares under this program.

item 1a. risk factors our businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate. risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10-k. the level of
importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time, and any of these risks may have a material effect on our business.
failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences our business is subject to a wide range of complex u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations described in the "industry regulation" section in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.
in addition, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business.  for example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and, thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities.  changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income.  changes in laws that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business.  health care reform under the affordable care act, related state laws, and the regulations thereunder, as well as pending federal health care legislation, have the potential to substantially impact the way that employers provide health insurance to employees and the health insurance market for our peo business, as well as the demand for our health care compliance solutions.  we are unable to determine the ultimate impact that health care reform, including the pending federal health care legislation, will have on our peo business and our ability to attract and retain peo clients or demand for our health care compliance solutions.
amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to obtain licenses in some jurisdictions. the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions, changes in regulators' interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations, or disagreement by a regulatory authority with our interpretation of such existing statutes or regulations, could require additional registration or licensing, limit certain of our business activities until they are appropriately licensed, and expose us to financial penalties. these occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or client funds investment strategy, which could adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted.
failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which which could adversely impact our business. we operate our business around the world, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") and the u.k. bribery act. such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the u.s. treasury department's office of foreign assets control ("ofac"), which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others.  in addition, some of our businesses in the u.s. and a number of countries in which we operate are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including, for example, the bank secrecy act of 1970, as amended by the usa patriot act of 2000 (the "bsa"). among other things, the bsa requires certain financial institutions, including banks and money services businesses (such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access), to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. we have registered our payroll card business with the treasury department's financial crimes enforcement network ("fincen") as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to a fincen regulation.
we have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and we are continuously in the process of
reviewing, upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures. however, there can be no assurance that our employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible, or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators.  any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. further, bank regulators are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations, and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses, as a class, to be higher risk customers for money laundering. as a result, our banking partners may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional requirements on us. these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks' internal risk-based policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us, may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business, may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.
failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences the collection, hosting, transfer, disclosure, use, storage and security of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal, state and foreign data privacy laws. these laws, which are not uniform, do one or more of the following: regulate the collection, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information; require notice to individuals of privacy practices; give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information; and prevent the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing. under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach. in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries. in addition, the european union adopted the comprehensive general data privacy regulation (the "gdpr") in may 2016 that will replace the current eu data protection directive and related country-specific legislation. the gdpr will become fully effective in may 2018. complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. the future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.
our businesses collect, host, transfer, disclose, use, store and secure personal and business information, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses in connection with our business, we collect, host, transfer, disclose, use, store and secure large amounts of personal and business information about our clients, employees of our clients, our vendors and our employees, contractors and temporary staff, including payroll information, health care information, personal and business financial data, social security numbers and their foreign equivalents, bank account numbers, tax information and other sensitive personal and business information.
we are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information, and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes. nonetheless, globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. although this is a global problem, it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent third parties may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect, host, use, transmit and store.
we have programs in place to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures. in addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other methods of deceiving these third parties or our employees, contractors, and temporary staff. as these threats continue to evolve and
increase, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. in addition, while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information, we do not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients or vendors, and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures.
any cyber attack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, theft of non-public or other sensitive information, or similar act by a malevolent party, or inadvertent acts or inactions by our employees, contractors or temporary staff, could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information, and could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations, or that of our clients, create liability, regulatory sanction or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients, or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider.
although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the data security incidents that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, a data security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. while adp maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.
our systems may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions. we rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, loss of clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. we have disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events. despite our preparations, our plans may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.
a disruption of our data centers could have a materially adverse effect on our business we host our applications and serve our clients from data centers that we operate and from data centers operated by third-party vendors. if any of our or our third party vendors' data centers fail or become disabled, even for a limited period of time, our businesses could be disrupted and we could suffer financial loss, liability to clients, loss of clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. in addition, our third party vendors may cease providing data center facilities or services, elect to not renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, breach their agreements with us or fail to satisfy our expectations, which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition.
if we fail to adapt our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences. in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, we continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our existing solutions and services. if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish.
political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility. when there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses. clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on payroll and other outsourcing services or renegotiating their contracts with us, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.
we invest our client funds in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents. nevertheless, our client fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. these risks may be exacerbated, individually or in unison, during periods of unusual financial market volatility. in addition, as part of our client funds investment strategy, we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. in order to satisfy these short-term funding requirements, we maintain access to various sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities, our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances. a reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may require us to sell client fund assets to satisfy our short-term funding requirements, which may result in the recognition of losses and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
we are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll, tax and other money movement services. while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures, a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll, tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.
we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and, as a result, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, potential customers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current customers, vendors, investors and other third parties. in addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.
change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong, investment-grade long-term debt ratings and the highest commercial paper ratings. failure to maintain high credit ratings on long-term and short-term debt could increase our cost of borrowing, reduce our ability to obtain intra-day borrowing required by our employer services business, and adversely impact our results of operations.
if the distribution of cdk global® common stock to adp's stockholders does not qualify as a tax-free spinoff, we could incur substantial liabilities and may not be fully indemnified for such liabilities on september 30, 2014, the company completed the tax-free spinoff of its former dealer services business through the distribution of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of cdk global, inc. ("cdk global") to adp's stockholders. cdk global was formed to hold adp's former dealer services business and, as a result of the distribution, became an independent public company trading under the symbol "cdk" on the nasdaq global select market. prior to completing the spinoff of cdk global, adp received an opinion from paul, weiss, rifkind, wharton & garrison llp, its counsel, to the effect that, based on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings set forth in the opinion, the distribution qualified as a transaction that is tax-free under section 355 and other related provisions of the internal revenue code. adp also received a private letter ruling from the irs with respect to certain discrete and significant issues arising in connection with the transactions effected in connection with the separation and distribution. the opinion and the ruling were based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by adp and cdk global. if any of those factual representations or assumptions was untrue or incomplete in any material respect, any undertaking is not complied with, or the facts upon which the opinion and the ruling were based were materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution, the distribution may not qualify for tax-free treatment. although a private letter ruling from the irs generally is binding on the irs, the irs did not rule that the distribution satisfies every requirement for a tax-free distribution. opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or the courts. as a result, the conclusions expressed in an opinion of counsel could be challenged by the irs, and if the irs prevails in such challenge, the tax consequences to adp's stockholders that received cdk global common stock pursuant to the distribution could be materially less favorable.
if the distribution were determined not to qualify as a tax-free transaction under section 355 of the code, each united states holder of adp common stock that received cdk global common stock pursuant to the distribution generally would be treated as receiving a distribution taxable as a dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of cdk global common stock received by such holder. in addition, adp generally would recognize gain with respect to the distribution and certain related transactions, and cdk global could be required to indemnify adp for any resulting taxes and related expenses, which could be material. the distribution and certain related transactions could be taxable to adp if cdk global or its stockholders were to engage in certain transactions after the distribution. in such cases, adp or its stockholders that received cdk global common stock pursuant to the spinoff could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities, and cdk global could be required to indemnify adp for any resulting taxes and related expenses, which could be material. cdk global may be unable to indemnify us fully for any such taxes and related expenses.
we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients. competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and, if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel, results of our operations may suffer.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements this document and other written or oral statements made from time to time by adp may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. statements that are not historical in nature and which may be identified by the use of words like "expects," "assumes," "projects," "anticipates," "estimates," "we believe," "could" "is designed to" and other words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions and depend upon or refer to future events or conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements or that could contribute to such difference include: adp's success in obtaining, and retaining clients, and selling additional services to clients; the pricing of products and services; compliance with existing or new legislation or regulations; changes in, or interpretations of, existing legislation or regulations; overall market, political and economic conditions, including interest rate and foreign currency trends; competitive conditions; our ability to maintain our current credit ratings and the impact on our funding costs and profitability; security or privacy breaches, fraudulent acts, and system interruptions and failures; employment and wage levels; changes in technology; availability of skilled technical associates; and the impact of new acquisitions and divestitures. adp disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. these risks and uncertainties, along with the risk factors discussed under "item 1a. risk factors," and in other written or oral statements made from time to time by adp, should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.
executive overview we are one of the largest providers of cloud-based human capital management ("hcm") solutions - including payroll, talent management, human resources and benefits administration, and time and attendance management - to employers around the world. as a leader in this industry, we are focused on driving product innovation, enhancing our distribution and service capabilities, and assisting our clients with their hcm needs in the face of ever increasing regulatory complexity.
•   worldwide new business bookings declined 5% from the year ended june 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2016") to $1.65 billion for fiscal 2017.
•   revenue grew 6% which includes one percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our cobra and chsa businesses and foreign currency translation.
•   pre-tax margin increased approximately 130 basis points to 20.4%; adjusted ebit margin increased 30 basis points to 19.8%.
•   we continued our shareholder friendly actions by returning $1.3 billion via share repurchases, and approximately $1 billion via dividends, which increased on a per-share basis for the 42nd consecutive year. we have fully distributed the proceeds from our fiscal 2016 debt issuance.
during fiscal 2017, we continued to focus on our global hcm strategy by investing to strengthen our underlying business model and prospects for sustainable long-term growth. our robust and diverse product offerings are the result of our continued investment in product innovation and service. our results in fiscal 2017 reflect the stability of our underlying business model and our disciplined strategy for profitable growth while maintaining our focus on shareholder friendly actions.
our new business bookings were down 5% during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, due to high demand in fiscal 2016 for our solutions that assist our clients in complying with the affordable care act ("aca"). we remain optimistic of our ability to deliver innovative and competitive products, as well as our sales force's ability to distribute our products heading into the year ending june 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018").
the causes of our client losses and resulting impact on our revenue retention continue to be a point of internal focus. our employer services revenue retention was down 50 basis points during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower retention on our legacy client platforms coupled with the anticipated loss of a large client within our former chsa business at the beginning of the fiscal year. we are seeing strong retention on our strategic platforms. we continue to upgrade our clients from legacy platforms to our new cloud-based solutions and focus on improving the client experience. we believe upgrading our clients from legacy platforms is an important aspect of our long-term strategy, giving our clients our most innovative and seamless products.
our implementation team's ability to implement our services as well as our sales force's ability to sell to clients and prospects drove revenue growth during fiscal 2017. our revenue growth also benefited from the continued increase in our pays per control metric, which we measure as the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as measured on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of u.s. geographic regions.
during fiscal 2017, we incurred $90.0 million in charges for a previously announced multi-year service alignment initiative intended to align our client service operations to our strategic platforms. in connection with this service alignment initiative, we anticipate incurring total pre-tax charges of about $30 million in the year ended june 30, 2018.
in november 2016, we completed the sale of our consumer health spending account ("chsa") and consolidated omnibus reconciliation act ("cobra") businesses which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $205 million.  this disposition, and subsequent partnership with the acquiring company, allows us to further sharpen our focus on our core capabilities while continuing to deliver a full suite of hcm solutions to current and future clients in a seamless fashion. the historical results of operations of this business are included in the employer services segment.
in january 2017, we acquired the marcus buckingham company ("tmbc"). tmbc is a provider of talent management technology, coaching, and consulting solutions. the acquisition reflects our commitment to innovation and enhances our core hcm capabilities, allowing us to deepen our offering in this critical area of talent management. the results of operations of this business will be included in the employer services segment.
we have a strong business model with a high percentage of recurring revenues, good margins, the ability to generate consistent healthy cash flows, strong client retention, and low capital expenditure requirements. our financial condition and balance sheet remain solid at june 30, 2017, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.8 billion.
we continue to make investments in our sales force and are pleased with the operational improvements of our organization, our ability to continuously innovate and offer new and exciting products to our clients, and the ability of our service organization to support these new services and strategic platforms.  our pipeline for future new business bookings remains strong, as we leverage our investments in our strategic platforms and our strong, tenured sales force. we believe that our focus on these areas will continue to drive our growth and success in the future.

we believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations, against prior period, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations.  we believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  the nature of these exclusions are for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  since these adjusted financial measures and other non-gaap metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their u.s. gaap measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.

(a) we continue to include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. the adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that is not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "all other interest expense" and "all other interest income."
(b) the majority of charges relating to our service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort represent severance charges. severance charges have been taken in the past and not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results. unlike
severance charges in prior periods, these specific charges relate to our broad-based, company-wide service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort. the fiscal 2017 workforce optimization effort adjustment totaling approximately $5 million represents a reversal of the fiscal 2016 estimate.
(c) the taxes on the gains on the sale of the businesses were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. the tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the year ended june 30, 2017 due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business and for the year ended june 30, 2016 due to a previously recorded non tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge.
(d) the tax benefit/provision on the service alignment initiative, workforce optimization effort, and the gain on the sale of the building was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.
(e) the adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our adjusted net earnings from continuing operations plus our adjusted provision for income taxes.
(f) "constant dollar basis" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations. "constant dollar basis" is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.
total revenues our revenues, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, which includes one percentage point of pressure from the net impact of acquisitions, the disposition of our chsa and cobra businesses and foreign currency translation. revenue increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings. refer to "analysis of reportable segments" for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, employer services and professional employer organization ("peo") services.
total revenues in fiscal 2017 include interest on funds held for clients of $397.4 million, as compared to $377.3 million in fiscal 2016.  the increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.7% to $23,023.5 million in fiscal 2017.
total expenses our total expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase is primarily due to an increase in peo services pass-through costs, the restructuring and dual operations costs related to our service alignment initiative, and increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue. these increases were partially offset by the disposition of our chsa and cobra businesses during fiscal 2017.
operating expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. peo services pass-through costs were $2,628.4 million for fiscal 2017, which included costs for benefits coverage of $2,173.9 million and costs for workers' compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $454.5 million.  these pass-through costs were $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016, which included costs for benefits coverage of $1,906.0 million and costs for workers' compensation and payment of state unemployment taxes of $430.3 million. additionally, operating expenses increased due to higher costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, including dual operation costs associated with our service alignment initiative, partially offset by the disposition of our chsa and cobra businesses.
systems development and programming costs, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, when compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by a higher proportion of capitalized costs of our strategic projects.
selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported, increased 6% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  the increase was primarily related to investments in our sales organization. selling, general and administrative expenses also increased due to additional restructuring charges which primarily relate to our service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort.

adjusted ebit increased 8% due to the increases in revenues and expenses discussed above. overall adjusted ebit margin increased from 19.5% in fiscal 2016 to 19.8% in fiscal 2017 due to operating efficiencies partially offset by 20 basis points of pressure from dual operation costs related to our service alignment initiative.
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 31.5% and 33.2%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 210 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of asu 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation (as further explained in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements), which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017. these decreases were partially offset by the impact of the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses and a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017.
adjusted provision for income taxes the effective tax rate, adjusted for the gain on the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses, the impact of the charges related to the service alignment initiative and workforce optimization effort, the gain on the sale of the building and the gain on the sale of the amd business in fiscal 2016, for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 30.9% and 33.3%, respectively. the decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate is due to tax incentives associated with the domestic production activity deduction and research tax credit for prior tax years which decreased our effective tax rate by 220 basis points in fiscal 2017 and the adoption of asu 2016-09 related to the new accounting guidance for excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation (as further explained in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements), which decreased our effective tax rate by 130 basis points in fiscal 2017. this decrease was offset by a lower benefit related to the usage of foreign tax credits in fiscal 2017.
net earnings from continuing operations and diluted eps from continuing operations net earnings from continuing operations, as reported, increased 16% in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and the reduction in our effective tax rate described above, when compared to fiscal 2016.
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18% to $3.85 in fiscal 2017, as compared to $3.25 in fiscal 2016. diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the increase in net earnings from continuing operations (inclusive of a $0.07 impact from the adoption of asu 2016-09 in fiscal 2017) and the impact of fewer shares outstanding, resulting from the repurchase of approximately 13.5 million shares in fiscal 2017 and 13.8 million shares in fiscal 2016, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.
adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted eps from continuing operations adjusted net earnings from continuing operations increased 11% in fiscal 2017 due to the increase in adjusted ebit and reduction in our effective tax rate described above when compared to fiscal 2016.

total revenues in fiscal 2016 include interest on funds held for clients of $377.3 million, as compared to $377.7 million in fiscal 2015.  the decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in the average interest rate earned in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by the increase in our average client funds balances of 2.8% to $22,418.7 million in fiscal 2016.
total expenses our total expenses, as reported, increased 7% in fiscal 2016, as compared to the same period in the prior year. the increase is primarily due to an increase in peo services pass-through costs as well as an increase in selling and implementation expenses to support our growth in new business bookings as we experienced continued demand for additional hcm solutions, including products that assist businesses in complying with the aca. total expenses also increased due to increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, and an increase in severance expenses, primarily related to our workforce optimization effort. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.

revenues employer services' revenues, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, which includes one percentage point of pressure from the net impact of acquisitions, the disposition of our chsa and cobra businesses, and foreign currency translation. revenues increased primarily due to new business started from new business bookings. our revenues also benefited from the impact of an increase in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as our pays per control increased 2.4% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.  the increases were partially offset by the impact of client losses and the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses during fiscal 2017. our worldwide client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2017 decreased 50 basis points to 90.0% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2016, primarily driven by the lower retention on our legacy client platforms and the anticipated loss of a large client within our former chsa business.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes employer services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported, increased 4% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  the increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $202.4 million.  the increase in expenses is related to increased costs of servicing our clients on growing revenues as well as investments in our sales organization, partially offset by the disposition of the chsa and cobra businesses during fiscal 2017.
employer services' overall margin increased from 30.4% to 30.6% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. this 20 basis point increase was driven by operational efficiencies partially offset by 30 basis points of pressure from dual operation costs related to our service alignment initiative.
revenues employer services' revenues, as reported, increased 5% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, despite a negative impact of one percentage point from foreign currency translation. revenues increased due to new business started from new business bookings, the impact of price increases, and an increase in the number of employees on our clients' payrolls as our u.s. pays per control increased 2.5% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.  these increases were partially offset by the impact of client losses and foreign currency translation. our worldwide client revenue retention rate for fiscal 2016 decreased 100 basis points to 90.5% as compared to our rate for fiscal 2015 primarily due to elevated losses on our legacy platforms.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes employer services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, as reported, increased 8% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015.  the increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $191.8 million.  the increase in expenses is related to increased costs of servicing our clients, as well as increased selling and implementation expenses due to new business bookings and associated implementation costs, including an increase in costs related to assisting our clients with aca compliance. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.
employer services' overall margin increased from 29.4% to 30.4% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. this increase is due to lower selling expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 as well as an increase of 30 basis points from foreign currency translation, partially offset by investments in implementation and operational resources to support our revenue growth.
revenues peo services' revenues as reported increased 13% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. such revenues include pass-through costs of $2,628.4 million for fiscal year 2017 and $2,336.3 million for fiscal year 2016 associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. the increase in revenues was due to a 12% increase in the average number of worksite employees, driven by an increase in the number of new peo services clients and growth in our existing clients.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes peo services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 21% in fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $333.1 million. this increase in expenses is primarily related to an increase in pass-through costs of $292.1 million. overall margin increased from 12.1% to 12.9% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, due to operating efficiencies, as our operating costs related to servicing our clients increased slower than our revenues.
revenues peo services' revenues as reported increased 16% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. such revenues include pass-through costs of $2,336.3 million for fiscal 2016 and $2,015.9 million for fiscal 2015 associated with benefits coverage, workers' compensation coverage, and state unemployment taxes for worksite employees. the increase in revenues was due to a 13% increase in the average number of worksite employees, driven by an increase in the number of new peo services clients and growth in our existing clients, as well as higher client participation and higher benefit pass-through costs in our peo benefit offerings.
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes peo services' earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased 23% in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. the increase was due to increased revenues discussed above, which was partially offset by an increase in expenses of $356.5 million. this increase in expenses is primarily related to an increase in pass-through costs of $320.4 million described above. overall margin increased from 11.4% to 12.1% for fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, due to operating efficiencies, as our operating costs related to servicing our clients increased slower than our revenues, and sales efficiencies.
other the primary components of "other" are non-recurring gains and losses, miscellaneous processing services, the elimination of intercompany transactions, interest expense, the results of operations of adp indemnity, certain charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, and the historical results of the amd business. beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, our chief operating decision maker began reviewing the company's results with stock-based compensation included in the company's operating segments. this change, as well as changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate level allocations, has been adjusted in both the current period and the prior period in the table above, and did not materially affect reportable segment results.
adp indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence.  peo services has secured a workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of aig. we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the peo services business.  premiums are charged by adp indemnity to peo services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the peo services' worksite employees. the premiums charged from adp indemnity to peo services are eliminated in other. changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by adp indemnity and included in other.  for the fiscal years 2013 to 2017, adp indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ace american insurance company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of chubb limited, to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity during these policy years. each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. we believe the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. during fiscal 2017, adp indemnity paid a premium of $221.0 million to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2017 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees. adp indemnity paid a premium of $235.0 million in july 2017 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the year ended june 30, 2018 ("fiscal 2018") policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2017 reinsurance policy.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources for corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, long-term marketable securities, and cash flow from operations together with our $9.5 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures.
for client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our u.s. short-term commercial paper program and our u.s. and canadian short-term reverse repurchase agreements together with our $9.5 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. please see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a further discussion of the risks of our client funds investment strategy. see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.
as of june 30, 2017, cash and short-term marketable securities were $2,783.6 million, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.
operating, investing and financing cash flows our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows for the years ended 2017, 2016, and 2015, are summarized as follows:
(in millions)                                                                                             years ended june 30,                                    $ change

net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to growth in our business and favorable changes in our working capital, which was due to the timing of payments from our clients and to our vendors in the ordinary course of business.
net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $15,061.8 million, as well as the timing of purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $1,493.5 million. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the proceeds from the sales and maturities of corporate and client fund marketable securities of $1,621.8 million.
net cash flows from financing activities changed due to the net decrease in client funds obligations of $14,923.9 million, as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, and proceeds from our $2.0 billion september 2015 debt issuance.
we purchased approximately 13.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $94.42 during fiscal 2017 as compared to purchases of 13.8 million shares at an average price per share of $82.88 during fiscal 2016. from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs.  the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased due to $226.7 million received from the sale of notes receivable related to dealer services financing arrangements during fiscal 2015.
net cash flows used in investing activities increased due to the timing of receipts and disbursements of restricted cash and cash equivalents held to satisfy client funds obligations of $5,257.6 million and the receipt of the cdk global, inc. ("cdk") dividend during fiscal 2015, partially offset by the timing of purchases of and proceeds from corporate and client funds marketable securities of $545.7 million.
net cash flows provided by financing activities increased due to the net increase in client funds obligations of $2,728.9 million, as a result of the timing of cash received and payments made related to client funds, proceeds from our $2.0 billion september 2015 debt issuance, a decrease in our repurchases of common stock, and the timing of borrowings and repayments of commercial paper. we purchased approximately 13.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $82.88 during fiscal 2016 as compared to purchases of 18.2 million shares at an average price per share of $85.28 during fiscal 2015. from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase programs. the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
capital resources and client fund obligations in september 2015, we issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025. we may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. however, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. see note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term financing, including this fiscal 2016 debt issuance.
our u.s. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. during the majority of fiscal 2017, this commercial paper program provided for the issuance of up to $9.25 billion in aggregate maturity value and in june 2017, we increased our commercial paper program to $9.5 billion. our commercial paper program is rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 by moody's. these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days.  in fiscal 2017 and 2016, our average daily borrowings were $3.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. the weighted average maturity of the company's commercial paper
our u.s. and canadian short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days.  we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2017 and 2016, there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. for fiscal 2017 and 2016, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $274.8 million and $341.0 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for client fund investments used as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements.
we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. we have a $3.5 billion, 364-day credit agreement with a group of lenders that matures in june 2018 with a one year term-out option. in addition, we have a five-year $3.75 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.25 billion credit facility maturing in june 2021 and june 2022, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  we had no borrowings through june 30, 2017 under the credit agreements. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.5 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. see note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.
our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-a mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. we own aaa rated senior tranches of fixed rate credit card, auto loan, equipment lease, and rate reduction, secured predominately by prime collateral.  all collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected.  in addition, we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks.  we do own mortgage-backed securities, which represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in a group or pool of one or more residential mortgages.  these securities are collateralized by the cash flows of 15-year and 30-year residential mortgages and are guaranteed primarily by federal national mortgage association as to the timely payment of principal and interest.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. see note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.
capital expenditures for continuing operations for fiscal 2017 were $249.1 million, as compared to $165.7 million for fiscal 2016. we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 to be about $200 million.
obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits (4)                                   $-                     $-                    $-                       $-              $74.6                     $74.6
other long-term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets:
compensation and benefits (5)                                                        $3.8                 $250.1                $123.1                   $273.0              $93.7                    $743.7
acquisition-related obligations (6)                                                  $2.6                   $8.1                    $-                       $-              $-                        $10.7
(2)   included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases. we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment. the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
(3)   purchase obligations are comprised of a $235.0 million reinsurance premium with chubb for the fiscal 2018 policy year, as well as obligations related to software subscription licenses and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.
(4)   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid.
(5)   compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $9.5 million in fiscal 2018.
(6)   acquisition-related obligations relate to contingent consideration for a business acquisition for which the amount of contingent consideration was determinable at the date of acquisition and therefore included on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability.
in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. as of june 30, 2017, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2018, total $27,189.4 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. we had $27,291.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30, 2017.
separately, adp indemnity paid a premium of $235.0 million in july 2017 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2018 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2017 reinsurance policy. at june 30, 2017, adp indemnity had total assets of $533.9 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $459.7 million for the policy years since july 1, 2003. adp indemnity paid claims of $10.7 million and $14.0 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. refer to the "analysis of reportable segments - other" above for additional information regarding adp indemnity.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes.  all of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.
we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  as part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities.  we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client's funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client's obligation.  as a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets.  such risks include the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations.  however, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations.  we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.5 billion commercial paper program (rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 ("p-1") by moody's, the highest possible credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreements and available borrowings under our $9.5 billion committed credit facilities. the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business.  in addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
we have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments.  the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb, for asset-backed securities is aaa, and for municipal bonds is a.  the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is 5 years, for single a rated securities is 7 years, and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is 10 years. time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a-1 and/or p-1. money market funds must be rated aaa/aaa-mf.

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested.  factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.  this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes.  the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased slightly to 1.6% for fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016.  a hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $11 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2018.  a hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $6 million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2018.
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  we limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily aaa and aa rated securities, as rated by moody's, standard & poor's, and for canadian securities, dbrs. approximately 79% of our available-for-sale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30, 2017.  in addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than u.s. and canadian government or government agency securities.
we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30, 2017 or 2016.
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 1, new accounting pronouncements, of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
revenue recognition. our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services (e.g., employer services' payroll processing fees), investment income on payroll funds, payroll tax filing funds and other employer services' client-related funds, and fees charged to implement clients on the company's solutions. we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction (e.g., number of payees or number of payrolls processed). fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
peo provides a comprehensive human resources outsourcing solution, including offering benefits, providing workers' compensation insurance, and administering state unemployment insurance, among other human resources functions. amounts collected from peo worksite employers include payroll, fees for benefits, and an administrative fee that also includes payroll taxes, fees for workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes.
the payroll and payroll taxes collected from the worksite employers are presented in revenue net, as the company is not the primary obligor with respect to this aspect of the peo arrangement. with respect to the payroll and payroll taxes, the worksite employer is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, and determines the service specifications.
the fees collected from the worksite employers for benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes are presented in revenues and the associated costs of benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes are included in operating expenses, as the company acts as a principal with respect to this aspect of the arrangement. with respect to the fees for benefits, workers' compensation and state unemployment taxes, the company is the primary obligor, has latitude in establishing price, selects suppliers, determines the service specifications and is liable for credit risk.
we recognize interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients in revenues as earned, as the collection, holding and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services.
we assess the collectability of revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer's payment history.
goodwill. we account for goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification ("asc") 350, "intangibles - goodwill and other," which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. according to asc 350, we can opt to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment or can directly perform the two-step impairment test. based on a qualitative assessment, if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test prescribed by asc 350 would be performed.
our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30, 2017 was performed using a qualitative approach. the qualitative assessment considered industry and market considerations for any deterioration in the environment in which we operate, the competitive environment, a decline (both absolute and relative to peers) in market-dependent multiples or metrics, any changes in the market for our services, and regulatory and political development. additionally, we assessed financial
performance by reporting unit and considered cost factors, such as labor or other costs, that would have a negative effect on results. the annual goodwill impairment assessments performed for fiscal 2017 have indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is substantially in excess of carrying value and not at risk of failing step one of the quantitative goodwill impairment test. based on our qualitative assessment, the company has determined that goodwill is not impaired.
income taxes. the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities. a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. specifically, the likelihood of an entity's tax benefits being sustained must be "more likely than not" assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements. if a tax position drops below the "more likely than not" standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the "more likely than not" standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes. a change in the assessment of the "more likely than not" standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. as of june 30, 2017 and 2016, the company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $74.6 million and $27.4 million, respectively.
if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. based on current estimates, favorable settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to $35 million in the next twelve months. audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
stock-based compensation. we measure stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. the binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and employee exercise behavior. expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price, and other factors. similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. the risk-free rate is derived from the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. determining these assumptions is subjective and complex, and, therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options.

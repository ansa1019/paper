item 1a   risk factors
before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere, and the other information contained, in this report and in our other filings with the sec, including our subsequent reports on forms 10-q and 8-k. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. in that event, the market price for our common stock will likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
our inability to compete successfully in our markets may harm our business.    the markets for our sdb products are highly competitive and are characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology. our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, on our ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative new products. the development of innovative new products by our competitors or the discovery of alternative treatments or potential cures for the conditions that our products treat could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete. current competitors, new entrants, academics, and others are trying to develop new devices, alternative treatments or cures, and pharmaceutical solutions to the conditions our products treat.
additionally, some of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. the past several years have seen a trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry and in the markets for our products. industry consolidation could result in greater competition if our competitors combine their resources, if our competitors are acquired by other companies with greater resources than ours, or if our competitors become affiliated with customers of ours. this competition could increase pressure on us to reduce the selling prices of our products or could cause us to increase our spending on research and development and sales and marketing. if we are unable to develop innovative new products, maintain competitive pricing, and offer products that consumers perceive to be as good as those of our competitors, our sales or gross margins could decrease which would harm our business.
our business depends on our ability to market effectively to dealers of home healthcare products and sleep clinics.    we market our products primarily to home healthcare dealers and to sleep clinics that diagnose osa and other sleep disorders, as well as to non-sleep specialist physician practices that diagnose and treat sleep disorders. we believe that these groups play a significant role in determining which brand of product a patient will use. the success of our business depends on our ability to market effectively to these groups to ensure that our products are properly marketed and sold by these third-parties.
we have limited resources to market to the sleep clinics, home healthcare dealer branch locations and to the non-sleep specialists, most of whom use, sell or recommend several brands of products. in addition, home healthcare dealers have experienced price pressures as government and third-party reimbursement has declined for home healthcare products, and home healthcare dealers are requiring price discounts and longer periods of time to pay for products purchased from us. we cannot assure you that physicians will continue to prescribe our products, or that home healthcare dealers or patients will not substitute competing products when a prescription specifying our products has been written.
we have expanded our marketing activities in some markets to target the population with a predisposition to sleep-disordered breathing as well as primary care physicians and various medical specialists. we cannot assure you that these marketing efforts will be successful in increasing awareness or sales of our products.
consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.    many home health care dealers are consolidating which may result in greater concentration of market power. as the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants may become more intense. these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices and components produced by us. if we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the health care industry, our revenues may decrease and our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows may suffer.
if we are unable to support our continued growth, our business could suffer.    as we continue to grow, the complexity of our operations increases, placing greater demands on our management. our ability to manage our growth effectively depends on our ability to implement and improve our financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to effect other changes in our business including, the ability to monitor and improve manufacturing systems, information technology, and quality and regulatory compliance systems, among others. unexpected difficulties during expansion, the failure to attract and retain qualified employees, the failure to successfully replace or upgrade our management information systems, the failure to manage costs or our inability to respond effectively to growth or plan for future expansion could cause our growth to stop. if we fail to manage our growth effectively and efficiently, our costs could increase faster than our revenues and our business results could suffer.
if we fail to integrate our recent acquisitions with our operations, our business could suffer.    in fiscal 2016 we completed a number of acquisitions, including among others, the acquisition of brightree, curative medical and inova labs. the success of these acquisitions, as well as our other recent acquisitions, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate the business and operations of the acquired companies and fully realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions. additionally, our management may have their attention diverted while trying to integrate these businesses. if we are not able to successfully integrate the operations, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.
we are subject to various risks relating to international activities that could affect our overall profitability.    we manufacture substantially all of our products outside the united states and sell a significant portion of our products in non-u.s. markets. sales outside north and latin america accounted for approximately 37% and 39% of our net revenues in the years ended june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016 respectively. we expect that sales within these areas will account for approximately 35% to 40% of our net revenues in the foreseeable future. our sales and operations outside of the u.s. are subject to several difficulties and risks that are separate and distinct from those we face in the u.s., including:
   fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
   compliance with foreign medical device manufacturing regulations;
   difficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;
   reduction in third-party payor reimbursement for our products;
   inability to obtain import licenses;
   changes in trade policies and in u.s. and foreign tax policies;
   possible changes in export or import restrictions; and
   the modification or introduction of other governmental policies with potentially adverse effects.
any of the above factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase or maintain our non-u.s sales.
government and private insurance plans may not adequately reimburse our customers for our products, which could result in reductions in sales or selling prices for our products.    our ability to sell our products depends in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for our products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. these third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can, without notice, deny coverage for our products or treatments that may include the use of our products. therefore, even if a product is approved for marketing, we cannot make assurances that coverage and reimbursement will be available for the product, that the reimbursement amount will be adequate or that the reimbursement amount, even if initially adequate, will not be subsequently reduced. for example, in some markets, such as spain, france and germany, government coverage and reimbursement are currently available for the purchase or rental of our products but are subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations. in other markets, such as australia, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sdb conditions. as we continue to develop new products, those products will generally not qualify for coverage and reimbursement until they are approved for marketing, if at all.
in the united states, we sell our products primarily to home healthcare dealers, hospitals and sleep clinics. reductions in reimbursement to our customers by third-party payers, if they occur, may have a material impact on our customers and, therefore, may indirectly affect our pricing and sales to, or the collectability of receivables we have from, those customers. a development negatively affecting reimbursement stems from the medicare competitive bidding program mandated by the mma. under the program, our customers who provide home healthcare services must compete to offer products in designated competitive bidding areas, or cbas. in addition, under the aca, in 2016, cms adjusted the prices in non-competitive bidding areas to match competitive bidding prices. cms phased in the new rates beginning january 1, 2016, and were fully effective july 1, 2016. this program has significantly reduced the medicare reimbursement to our customers compared with reimbursement in 2011, at the beginning of the program. similarly, provisions of the 21st century cures act were signed into law, which retroactively adjusted rates in non-bid areas to allow for the higher phase-in rates to be paid for items furnished between july 1, 2016 and december 31, 2016, rather than the lower fully-adjusted rates. these payment adjustments are expected to be completed by october 2017. if changes are made to this law in the future, it could affect amounts being recovered by our customers.
we cannot predict at this time the full impact the competitive bidding program and the developments in the competitive bidding program will have on our business and financial condition.
healthcare reform may have a material adverse effect on our industry and our results of operations.    in march 2010, the aca was signed into law in the united states. the aca made changes that significantly impacted the healthcare industry, including medical device manufacturers. one of the principal purposes of the aca was to expand health insurance coverage to millions of americans who were uninsured. the aca required adults not covered by an employer- or government-sponsored insurance plan to maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty, a provision commonly referred to as the individual mandate.
the aca also contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions. this included new fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. beginning in 2013, entities that manufacture, produce or import medical devices were required to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such devices are sold in the united states. this excise tax is applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs, which includes the apnealink, vpap tx, certain respiratory care and dental sleep products. the medical device tax was suspended for 2016 and 2017 calendar years, but is scheduled to return beginning in 2018, absent further congressional action. in addition to the competitive bidding changes discussed above, the aca also included, among other things, demonstrations to develop organizations that are paid under a new payment methodology for voluntary coordination of care by groups of providers, such as physicians and hospitals, and the establishment of a new patient-centered outcomes research institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research. the increased funding and focus on comparative clinical effectiveness research, which compares and evaluates the risks and benefits, clinical outcomes, effectiveness and appropriateness of products, may result in lower reimbursements by payers for our products and decreased profits to us.
other federal legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the aca was enacted. these changes included an aggregate reduction in medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on april 1, 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken. on january 2, 2013, the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
the full impact on our business of the aca and other new laws is uncertain. nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our products. future actions by the administration and the u.s. congress including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement of the aca could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. additionally, all or a portion of the aca and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge.
various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level within the united states. the aca as well as other federal and/or state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, singularly or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
failure to comply with anti-kickback and fraud regulations could result in substantial penalties and changes in our business operations.    although we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from medicare, medicaid or other third-party payors for our products, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal, state and foreign governments, which could significantly impact our business. we also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country.
in the united states, the laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
                                                      the federal anti-kickback statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid. a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate the anti-kickback statute itself to have committed a violation. the u.s. government has interpreted this law broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us;
                                                   federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. these laws may apply to manufacturers and distributors who provide information on coverage, coding, and reimbursement of their products to persons who do bill third-party payers;
                  hipaa, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation;
                                              the federal physician sunshine act requirements under the aca, which impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device and drug manufacturers for any transfer of value made or distributed by certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to physicians (including doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
   federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers;
                                                    state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.
the scope and enforcement of these laws are uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. for example, in july 2016, we received a federal administrative subpoena from the office of inspector general, or oig, of the department of health and human services. the subpoena contains a request for documents and other materials that relate primarily to industry offerings of patient resupply software to home medical equipment providers. in november 2016, we received a second subpoena, requesting documents and other materials regarding other promotional programs. we are cooperating with the governments request for documents and information. responding to investigations can be time-and resource-consuming and can divert managements attention from the business. additionally, as a result of these investigations, healthcare providers and entities may face litigation or have to agree to settlements that can include monetary penalties and onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement. any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from governmental health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
our use and disclosure of individually identifiable information, including health information, is subject to federal, state and foreign privacy and security regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm.    the privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored, maintained, received or transmitted electronically is a major issue in the united states and abroad. while we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, legal standards for privacy, including but not limited to unfairness and deception, as enforced by the ftc and state attorneys general, continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose audience and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. recently, there has been an increase in public awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about the activities of various government agencies and in the number of private privacy-related lawsuits filed against companies. concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personally identifiable information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, could damage our reputation and harm our business.
numerous foreign, federal and state laws and regulations govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of personally identifiable health information, including (i) state privacy and confidentiality laws (including state laws requiring disclosure of breaches); (ii) hipaa; and (iii) european and other foreign data protection laws.
hipaa establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information, including what is known as protected health information, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers that submit certain covered transactions electronically, or covered entities, and their business associates, which are persons or entities that perform certain services for, or on behalf of, a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. certain portions of our business, such as the cloud-based software digital health applications, are subject to hipaa as a business associate of our covered entities clients. to provide our covered entity clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of phi, hipaa requires us to enter into business associate agreements that require us to safeguard phi in accordance with hipaa. as a business associate, we are also directly liable for compliance with hipaa. penalties for violations of hipaa regulations include civil and criminal penalties.
hipaa authorizes state attorneys general to file suit under hipaa on behalf of state residents. courts can award damages, costs and attorneys fees related to violations of hipaa in such cases. while hipaa does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for hipaa violations, its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care claim in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of phi.
hipaa further requires business associates like us to notify our covered entity clients without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach if their unsecured phi is subject to an unauthorized access, use or disclosure. if a breach affects 500 patients or more, covered entities must report it to hhs and local media without unreasonable delay, and hhs will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. if a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals, the covered entity must log it and notify hhs at least annually.
if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of health information entrusted to us, our solutions may be perceived as not secure, we may incur significant liabilities and customers may curtail their use of or stop using our solutions. in addition, if we fail to comply with the terms of our business associate agreements with our clients, we are liable not only contractually but also directly under hipaa.
we are also subject to laws and regulations in non-u.s. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. eu member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information, and sensitive personal data such as health data. these laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations, and have generally become more stringent over time.
for example, the new eu-wide gdpr will implement more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information and mandatory data breach notification requirements. compliance with such laws and regulations could cause our costs to increase and harm our business and financial condition. additionally, limitations on our ability to use and share personal data could adversely affect our business.
we are also subject to evolving eu laws on data export, as we may transfer personal data from the eu to other jurisdictions. for example, in february 2016, the eu and the united states agreed to a new framework regarding the transfer of personal data from the eu to the united states called the privacy shield. however, there is currently litigation challenging this framework, and it is uncertain whether the privacy shield framework will be invalidated by the eu courts, similar to the treatment of the prior governing framework. we do not transfer any personal data relating to patients between the eu and united states. all other personal data transfers are subject to our internal controls as well as standard model clauses with any relevant european countries.
in recent years, u.s. and european lawmakers and regulators have also expressed concern over electronic marketing and the use of third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising. in the eu, informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie on a users device. the current eu laws that cover the use of cookies and similar technology and marketing online or by electronic means are under reform. a draft of the new eprivacy regulation was announced on january 10, 2017 and is targeted to become applicable on may 25, 2018 (alongside the gdpr). unlike the current eprivacy directive, this will be directly implemented into the laws of each of the eu member states, without the need for further enactment. when implemented, the eprivacy regulation is expected to alter rules on third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising and to impose stricter requirements on companies using these tools. the draft also extends the strict opt-in marketing rules with limited exceptions to business to business communications, and significantly increases penalties.
any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations, fines and penalties, litigation and/or adverse publicity, including by consumer advocacy groups, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations or suffer a security breach, such violations may also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations and/or could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business.
our business activities are subject to extensive regulation, and any failure to comply could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.    we are subject to extensive u.s. federal, state, local and international regulations regarding our business activities. failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, recalls of our products, substantial fines and criminal charges against us or against our employees. furthermore, our products could be subject to recall if the food and drug administration, or the fda, other regulators or we determine, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective. any recall or other regulatory action could increase our costs, damage our reputation, affect our ability to supply customers with the quantity of products they require and materially affect our operating results.
actual or attempted breaches of security, unauthorized disclosure of information, denial of service attacks or the perception that personal and/or other sensitive or confidential information in our possession is not secure, could result in a material loss of business, substantial legal liability or significant harm to our reputation.     we receive, collect, process, use and store a large amount of information from clients and our own employees, including personally identifiable, protected health and other sensitive and confidential information. this data is often accessed by us through transmissions over public and private networks, including the internet. the secure transmission of such information over the internet and other mechanisms is essential to maintain confidence in our information technology systems. we have implemented security measures, technical controls and contractual precautions designed to identify, detect and prevent unauthorized access, alteration, use or disclosure of our and our clients and employees data. however, there is no guarantee that these measures can provide absolute security. beyond external criminal activity, systems that access or control access to our services and databases may be compromised as a result of human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address all possible techniques or implement adequate preventive measures for all situations.
if someone is able to circumvent or breach our security systems, they could steal any information located therein or cause interruptions to our operations. security breaches or attempts thereof could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of monetary loss and/or litigation, fines and sanctions. we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our clients and others who interact with our data. while we maintain insurance that covers certain security and privacy breaches, we may not carry appropriate insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for all potential liability.
we are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, including hipaa and european data privacy laws. complying with these numerous and complex regulations is expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could result in regulatory scrutiny, fines and civil liability. in addition, any security breach or attempt thereof could result in liability for stolen assets or information, additional costs associated with repairing any system damage, incentives offered to clients or other business partners to maintain business relationships after a breach, and implementation of measures to prevent future breaches, including organizational changes, deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies, employee training and engagement of third-party experts and consultants. furthermore, these rules are constantly changing; for example, as stated above, the eu-u.s. safe harbor framework has been declared invalid and the eu-u.s. privacy shield framework has recently been formally adopted by the european commission. additionally, the costs incurred to remediate any data security or privacy incident could be substantial.
we cannot assure you that any of our third-party service providers with access to our or our clients and/or employees personally identifiable and other sensitive or confidential information will maintain appropriate policies and practices regarding data privacy and security in compliance with all applicable laws or that they will not experience data security breaches or attempts thereof, which could have a corresponding effect on our business.
product sales, introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of fda regulations or similar foreign regulations, which could cause our sales and profits to decline.    unless a product is exempt, before we can market or sell a new medical device in the united states, we must obtain fda clearance or approval, which can be a lengthy and time-consuming process. we generally receive clearance from the fda to market our products in the united states under section 510(k) of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act or our products are exempt from the section 510(k) clearance process. the 510(k) clearance process can be expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. in the 510(k) clearance process, the fda must determine that a proposed device is substantially equivalent to a device legally on the market, known as a predicate device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. the fda has a high degree of latitude when evaluating submissions and may determine that a proposed device submitted for 510(k) clearance is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. after a device receives 510(k) premarket notification clearance from the fda, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, technology, materials, packaging, and certain manufacturing processes may require a new 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. we have modified some of our section 510(k) approved products without submitting new section 510(k) notices, which we do not believe were required. however, if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit new section 510(k) notifications for modifications to our existing products, we may be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the section 510(k) notification.
any new product introduction or existing product modification could be subjected to a lengthier, more rigorous fda examination process. for example, in certain cases we may need to conduct clinical trials of a new product before submitting a 510(k) notice. we may also be required to obtain premarket approvals for certain of our products. indeed, recent trends in the fdas review of premarket notification submissions suggest that the fda is often requiring manufacturers to provide new, more expansive, or different information regarding a particular device than what the manufacturer anticipated upon 510(k) submission. this has resulted in increasing uncertainty and delay in the premarket notification review process.
for example, the fda recently evaluated its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510(k) for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device. although the fda had proposed a number of changes to a long-standing guidance from 1997 on this topic, the fda concluded that manufacturers should continue adhering to the principles in the 1997 guidance. in august 2016, the fda issued a new draft guidance, which fda believes preserves the basic format and content of the 1997 guidance with updates to add clarity. the fdas ongoing review of the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products, either by imposing more strict requirements on when a manufacturer must submit a new 510(k) for a modification to a previously cleared product, or by applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. fda continues to review its 510(k) clearance process which could result in additional changes to regulatory requirements or guidance documents which could increase the costs of compliance, or restrict our ability to maintain current clearances. the requirements of the more rigorous premarket approval process and/or significant changes to the 510(k) clearance process could delay product introductions and increase the costs associated with fda compliance. marketing and sale of our products outside the united states are also subject to regulatory clearances and approvals, and if we fail to obtain these regulatory approvals, our sales could suffer. we cannot assure you that any new products we develop will receive required regulatory approvals from u.s. or foreign regulatory agencies.
we are subject to substantial regulation related to quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes. our failure to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.    the fda regulates the approval, manufacturing, and sales and marketing of many of our products in the u.s. significant government regulation also exists in canada, japan, europe, and other countries in which we conduct business. as a device manufacturer, we are required to register with the fda and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fdas quality system regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. in addition, the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda. in the european community, we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls or related field actions, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing. efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions, withdrawals, and/or declining sales.
laws regulating consumer contacts could adversely affect our business operations or create liabilities.    our business activities include contacts with consumers in different parts of the world. certain laws, such as the u.s. telephone consumer protection act, regulate telemarketing practices and certain automated outbound contacts with consumers, such as phone calls, texts or emails. our use of outbound contacts may be restricted by existing laws, or by laws, regulations, or regulatory decisions that may be adopted in the future. if we are found to have violated these laws or regulations, we may be subjected to substantial fines, penalties, or liabilities to consumers.
our products are the subject of clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors, or other third parties, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.    as a part of the regulatory process to obtain marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, or for other reasons, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. we, our competitors, or other third parties may also conduct clinical trials involving our commercially marketed products. the results of clinical trials may be unfavorable or inconsistent with previous findings, or could identify safety signals associated with our products. for example, in may 2015, we announced the preliminary analysis of the data from the serve-hf clinical trial, which was designed to assess whether the treatment of moderate to severe predominant central sleep apnea with adaptive servo-ventilation, or asv therapy could reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure. the preliminary headline results showed no significant difference with respect to all-cause mortality and hospitalization. however, the analysis of the data identified a statistically significant, 2.5% absolute, increased risk of cardiovascular mortality for those patients in the trial who received asv therapy with moderate to severe predominant central sleep apnea and symptomatic chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. we worked with global regulatory authorities to revise the labels and instructions for use for resmed asv devices as well as informing healthcare providers, physicians, and patients of the cardiovascular safety signal observed in serve-hf. current or future clinical trials may not meet primary endpoints, may reveal disadvantages of our products and solutions for various markets we address, or could generate unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data. clinical data, or the markets or regulatory bodies perception of the clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product clearances or approvals, and our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate. moreover, if these clinical trials identify serious safety issues associated with our marketed products, potentially adverse consequences could result, including that regulatory authorities could withdraw clearances or approvals of our products, we could be required to halt the marketing and sales of our products or recall our products, we could be required to update our product labeling with additional warnings, we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients, and our reputation may suffer. any of these could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.    the fda strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about fda-cleared products. in particular, clearance under section 510(k) only permits us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the fda. we may request additional label indications for our current products, and the fda may deny those requests outright, require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. if the fda determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we could be subject to fines, injunctions or other penalties. it is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment of our operations. any of these events could significantly harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.
disruptions in the supply of components from our single source suppliers could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability.    we purchase uniquely configured components for our devices from various suppliers, including some who are single-source suppliers for us. we cannot assure you that a replacement supplier would be able to configure its components for our devices on a timely basis or, in the alternative, that we would be able to reconfigure our devices to integrate the replacement part. a reduction or halt in supply while a replacement supplier reconfigures its components, or while we reconfigure our devices for the replacement part, would limit our ability to manufacture our devices, which could result in a significant reduction in sales and profitability. we cannot assure you that our inventories would be adequate to meet our production needs during any prolonged interruption of supply.
we are subject to potential product liability claims that may exceed the scope and amount of our insurance coverage, which would expose us to liability for uninsured claims.    we are subject to potential product liability claims as a result of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates. in addition, we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of our policy limits. our insurance policies have various exclusions, and thus we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage, in which case, we may have to pay the entire amount of any award. we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate or that all claims brought against us will be covered by our insurance and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. a successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could harm our business.
our intellectual property may not protect our products, and/or our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third-parties.    we rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain united states and foreign patent protection for our products, their uses and our processes to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third-parties. we have a number of pending patent applications, and we do not know whether any patents will issue from any of these applications. we do not know whether any of the claims in our issued patents or pending applications will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable. legal standards regarding the validity of patents and the proper scope of their claims are still evolving, and there is no consistent law or policy regarding the valid breadth of claims. additionally, there may be third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our products and technology which are not known to us and that block or compete with our products. we face the risks that:
   we will not have adequate remedies for infringement;
   our trade secrets will become known to or independently developed by our competitors; or
   third-parties will be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require us to license and pay fees or royalties in order for us to be able to market some of our products.
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our proprietary rights, or to defend third-party claims that we have infringed on proprietary rights of others. for example, we are involved in litigation with fisher & paykel healthcare, which has sued us in the u.s. district court for the southern district of california for allegedly infringing various of their patents. related cases are now pending in new zealand, germany and the united kingdom. if the outcome of any litigation or proceeding brought against us were adverse, we could be subject to significant liabilities to third-parties, could be required to obtain licenses from third-parties, could be forced to design around the patents at issue or could be required to cease sales of the affected products. a license may not be available at all or on commercially viable terms, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. additionally, the laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country, and we cannot assure you that any patent issues we face will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits.
tax laws, regulations, and enforcement practices are evolving and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.    tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions are evolving and may be subject to significant changes due to economic, political, and other conditions. there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for taxes. governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues, particularly from multinational corporations, which may lead to an increase in audit activity and aggressive positions taken by tax authorities.
for example, the current u.s. administration and certain members of congress have made public statements indicating that corporate tax reform is a priority. changes to u.s. tax laws could materially affect the tax treatment of our domestic and foreign earnings. the organisation for economic co-operation and development, an international association of 34 countries, including the united states, released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting, or beps, action plans, which aim to standardize and modernize global tax policies. the beps action plans propose revisions to numerous tax rules, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment, hybrid entities and instruments, transfer pricing, and tax treaties. the beps action plans have been or are being enacted by countries where we have operations.
developments in relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and enforcement practices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows, including the need to obtain additional financing.
we are subject to tax audits by various tax authorities in many jurisdictions.    our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. we are currently under audit by the australian taxation office for the tax years 2009 to 2013. although we do not believe that any material adjustments will result from this audit, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. any final assessment resulting from tax audits may result in material changes to our past or future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets, and may require us to pay penalties and interest that could materially adversely affect our financial results.
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation for a variety of reasons.    our operating results have, from time to time, fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future. these fluctuations may result from a number of factors, including:
   the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
   the success and costs of our marketing efforts in new regions;
   changes in third-party payor reimbursement;
   timing of regulatory clearances and approvals;
   expenditures incurred for research and development;
   competitive pricing in different regions;
   the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses; and
   other activities of our competitors.
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate.
if a natural or man-made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities, we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline.    our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead-time to repair or replace. the facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster, we would be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers. although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from causalities, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
delaware law and provisions in our charter and could make it difficult for another company to acquire us.    provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management which might be beneficial to us or our security holders. in particular, our board of directors is divided into three classes, serving for staggered three-year terms. because of this classification, it will require at least two annual meetings to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors. additionally, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without further vote or action by the stockholders. the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.
you may not be able to enforce the judgments of u.s. courts against some of our assets or officers and directors.    a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states. additionally, some of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states, along with all or a substantial portion of their assets. as a result, it may not be possible for investors to enforce judgments of u.s. courts relating to any liabilities under u.s. securities laws against our assets, those persons or their assets. in addition, investors may not be able to pursue claims based on u.s. securities laws against these assets or these persons in australian courts, where most of these assets and persons reside.
we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure.    our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and other events. likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public, or may be permanently lost. while we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation, business, operations or financial condition of the company. in addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities.
our results of operations may be materially affected by global economic conditions generally, including conditions in the financial markets.    recently, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the ability of sovereign nations to pay their debts have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the financial markets going forward. these factors, combined with volatile commodity prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown. it is difficult to predict how long the current economic conditions will continue and whether the economic conditions will continue to deteriorate. if the economic climate in the united states or outside the united states continues to deteriorate or there is a shift in government spending priorities, customers or potential customers could reduce or delay their purchases, which could impact our revenue, our ability to manage inventory levels, collect customer receivables, and ultimately decrease our profitability.
our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business.    as of june 30, 2017, our total consolidated debt was approximately $1.1 billion. we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. our indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:
   making it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations;
   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions
   limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
   limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and
our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal in indebtedness, which could impede our growth. our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness, and to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
we may write-off intangible assets, such as goodwill.    we have recorded intangible assets, including goodwill in connection with our acquisitions of brightree, curative medical and inova labs. at least on an annual basis, we will evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate any impairment of the values of these intangible assets. as circumstances change, we cannot assure you that the value of these intangible assets will be realized by us. if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we will be required to write-off the impaired portion of intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write-off occurs.
before we acquired brightree, curative medical and inova labs, those companies were each privately-held, and their new obligations of being a part of a public company may require significant resources and management attention.    when we acquired brightree, curative medical and inova labs, the acquired entities became subsidiaries of our consolidated company, and are now required to comply with the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the sec and the public company accounting oversight board. we will need to ensure that each of the acquired companies establishes and maintains effective disclosure controls as well as internal controls and procedures for financial reporting, and such compliance efforts may be costly and may divert the attention of management.
item 7   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
overview managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of resmed inc. and subsidiaries. it is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report.
we are a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating, diagnosing, and managing sdb and other respiratory disorders. during the fiscal year, we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market. in our efforts, we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on co-morbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity.
we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. during fiscal year 2017, we invested approximately $144.5 million on research and development activities, which represents approximately 7.0% of net revenues. since the development of cpap, we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including devices, informatics solutions, diagnostic products, mask systems, headgear and other accessories. during fiscal year 2017, we released new products including the airmini pap device, airfit mask range and airtouch masks. we also introduced a number of new software solutions including our resmed resupply, goscripts and new features and enhancements within our cloud-based software offerings. through our acquisition of brightree in 2016, we also acquired a suite of software-as-a-service solutions for u.s. based distributors and home health and hospice customers. these products, our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth.
net revenue in fiscal year 2017 increased to $2,066.7 million, an increase of 12% compared to fiscal year 2016. gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $1,201.7 million, from $1,066.5 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $135.2 million or 13%. our net income for the year ended june 30, 2017 was $342.3 million or $2.40 per diluted share compared to net income of $352.4 million or $2.49 per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2016.
total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2017 was $414.1 million and at june 30, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $821.9 million. at june 30, 2017, our total assets were $3.5 billion and our stockholders equity was $2.0 billion. we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to the acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016. accordingly, we did not purchase any shares during fiscal year 2017. during fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $102.1 million under our share repurchase program. we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share during fiscal 2017 with a total amount of $186.3 million paid to stockholders.
in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a constant currency basis, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. in order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. however, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to u.s. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
net revenues.    net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased to $2,066.7 million from $1,838.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $228.0 million or 12% (a 13% increase on a constant currency basis). net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2017 includes revenue of $138.1 million from our brightrees operations. excluding revenue attributable to brightree, net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2017 was $1,928.7 million, an increase of $118.9 million or 7% compared to the year ended june 30, 2016 (an 8% increase on a constant currency basis). the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. movements in international currencies against the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $17.2 million for the year ended june 30, 2017.
net revenue in north and latin america for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased to $1,310.1 million from $1,130.4 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $179.7 million or 16%. excluding revenue attributable to brightree, net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $1,172.1 million, an increase of $70.5 million or 6%. the increase in net revenue in north and latin america, excluding revenue attributable to brightree, is primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
net revenue in markets outside north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $756.6 million from $708.3 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $48.3 million or 7% (a 9% increase on a constant currency basis). the constant currency increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
net revenue from devices for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased to $1,161.0 million from $1,064.2 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $96.8 million or 9%, including an increase of 9% in north and latin america and an increase of 10% outside north and latin america (a 12% increase on a constant currency basis). net revenue from masks and other accessories for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased to $767.7 million from $745.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of 3%, including an increase of 4% in north and latin america and an increase of 1% outside north and latin america (a 4% increase on a constant currency basis). excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, device sales for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased by 10%, and masks and accessories sales increased by 4%, compared to the year ended june 30, 2016.
the following table summarizes the percentage movements in our net revenue, excluding revenue attributable to brightree following the closing of our acquisition, for the year ended june 30, 2017 compared to the year ended june 30, 2016:
north and latin         markets outside         total         markets outside               total america               north and                             north and           (constant latin america                         latin america          currency)*
masks and other accessories                   4   %                   1   %         3   %                   4   %               4   %
gross profit.    gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $1,201.7 million from $1,066.5 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $135.2 million or 13%. gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 58.1% for the year ended june 30, 2017, compared with the 58.0% for the year ended june 30, 2016. the increase in gross margin was due primarily to manufacturing and procurement efficiencies, and an incremental contribution from the brightree acquisition, partly offset by declines in our average selling prices and unfavorable product mix as sales of our lower margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $554.0 million from $488.1 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $65.9 million or 14%. the selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported in u.s. dollars, were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $1.2 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased by 14% compared to the year ended june 30, 2016. as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2017 were 26.8%, compared to 26.5% for the year ended june 30, 2016.
the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional personnel to support our commercial activities, increased legal expenses, increased professional fees and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
research and development expenses.    research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2017 to $144.5 million from $118.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2016, an increase of $25.8 million or 22%. the research and development expenses were unfavorably impacted by the appreciation of the australian dollar against the u.s. dollar, which increased our expenses by approximately $3.7 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended june 30, 2017 increased by 19% compared to the year ended june 30, 2016. as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 7.0% for the year ended june 30, 2017 compared to 6.5% for the year ended june 30, 2016.
the increase in research and development expenses in constant currency terms was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel, an increase in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
restructuring expenses.    during the year ended june 30, 2017, we incurred restructuring expenses of $12.4 million associated with the reorganization of our paris manufacturing activities and german research and development activities. the restructuring expenses consisted primarily of severance payments to employees in our german and paris facilities, site closure costs and associated project cancellation costs. we recorded the full amount of $12.4 million during the year ended june 30, 2017, within our operating expenses and separately disclosed the amount as restructuring expenses and had $6.5 million remaining in our employee related costs accrual at year end. during the year ended june 30, 2016, we incurred restructuring expenses of $6.9 million associated with the rationalizing our european research and development operations and manufacturing facilities. the restructuring expenses consisted primarily of severance payments and an asset write-down of a legacy manufacturing facility.
amortization of acquired intangible assets.    amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30, 2017 totaled $46.6 million compared to $23.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2016. the increase in amortization expense was attributable to our acquisitions from the prior year, in particular brightree, curative medical and inova labs.
total other income (loss), net.    total other income (loss), net for the year ended june 30, 2017 was a loss of $7.1 million, compared with an income of $10.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2016. the change was due primarily to an increase in interest expense due to higher borrowings.
income taxes.    our effective income tax rate decreased to 18.3% for the year ended june 30, 2017 from 19.8% for the year ended june 30, 2016. our effective income tax rate is affected by the geographic mix of our taxable income, including lower taxes associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations. our singapore and malaysia operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30, 2020. as of june 30, 2017, we have not provided for u.s. income taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. we intend for these earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states.
net income and earnings per share.    as a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended june 30, 2017 was $342.3 million compared to net income of $352.4 million for the year ended june 30, 2016. our earnings per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2017 was $2.40 compared to $2.49 for the year ended june 30, 2016, a decrease of 4%.
net revenues.    net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased to $1,838.7 million from $1,678.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $159.8 million or 10% (a 13% increase on a constant currency basis). net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2016 includes revenue of $28.9 million from brightrees operations since the closing of our acquisition of brightree. excluding revenue attributable to brightree, net revenue for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $1,809.8 million, an increase of $130.9 million or 8% compared to the year ended june 30, 2015 (an 11% increase on a constant currency basis). the increase in net revenue was attributable to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices. movements in international currencies against the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $55.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2016.
net revenue in north and latin america for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased to $1,130.4 million from $962.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $167.7 million or 17%. excluding revenue attributable to brightree, net revenue in north and latin america increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $1,101.5 million, an increase of $138.8 million or 14%. the increase in net revenue in north and latin america, excluding revenue attributable to brightree, is primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
net revenue in markets outside north and latin america decreased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $708.3 million from $716.2 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, a decrease of $7.9 million or 1% (a 6% increase on a constant currency basis). the constant currency increase in sales outside north and latin america predominantly reflects an increase in unit sales of our devices, masks and accessories, partially offset by a decline in average selling prices.
net revenue from devices for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased to $1,064.2 million from $975.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $88.3 million or 9%, including an increase of 19% in north and latin america and a decrease of 1% outside north and latin america (a 6% increase on a constant currency basis). net revenue from masks and other accessories for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased to $745.6 million from $703.0 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of 6%, including an increase of 10% in north and latin america and a decrease of 2% outside north and latin america (a 5% increase on a constant currency basis). excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, device sales for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased by 13%, and masks and accessories sales increased by 9%, compared to the year ended june 30, 2015.
the following table summarizes the percentage movements in our net revenue, excluding revenue attributable to brightree following the closing of our acquisition, for the year ended june 30, 2016 compared to the year ended june 30, 2015:
north and       markets outside           total         markets outside               total latin america       north and                                     north and           (constant latin america                             latin america          currency)*
masks and other accessories                10   %                  -2   %         6   %                   5   %               9   %
gross profit.    gross profit increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $1,066.5 million from $1,011.4 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $55.1 million or 5%. gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 58.0% for the year ended june 30, 2016, compared with the 60.2% for the year ended june 30, 2015. the decline in gross margins was primarily due to an unfavorable product mix as sales of our lower margin products represented a higher proportion of our sales, declines in our average selling prices and an unfavorable geographic mix with sales in our lower margin geographic areas representing a higher proportion of our overall sales.
selling, general and administrative expenses.    selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $488.1 million from $478.6 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $9.4 million or 2%. the selling, general and administrative expenses, as reported in u.s. dollars, were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $25.6 million. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased by 7% compared to the year ended june 30, 2015. as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended june 30, 2016 was 26.5%, compared to 28.5% for the year ended june 30, 2015.
the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional personnel to support our commercial activities, increased legal expenses, acquisition expenses and incremental expenses due to the inclusion of our recent business acquisitions.
research and development expenses.    research and development expenses increased for the year ended june 30, 2016 to $118.7 million from $114.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of $3.8 million or 3%. the research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the depreciation of the australian dollar and euro against the u.s. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $13.9 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended june 30, 2016 increased by 15% compared to the year ended june 30, 2015. as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.5% for the year ended june 30, 2016 compared to 6.8% for the year ended june 30, 2015.
the increase in research and development expenses in constant currency terms was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel, an increase in materials and tooling costs incurred to facilitate development of new products and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
restructuring expenses.    during the year ended june 30, 2016 we incurred restructuring expenses of $6.9 million associated with rationalizing our european research & development operations and manufacturing facilities. the restructure cost consisted primarily of severance payments and an asset write-down of a legacy manufacturing facility.
amortization of acquired intangible assets.    amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended june 30, 2016 totaled $23.9 million compared to $8.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2015. the increase in amortization expense was attributable to our acquisitions during the year, in particular brightree, curative medical and inova labs.
total other income, net.    total other income, net for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $10.6 million, compared with $26.7 million for the year ended june 30, 2015. the decrease in total other income, net, was due primarily to lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on cash balances held, an increase in interest expense due to higher borrowings and reduced foreign currency hedging gains due to the depreciation of the australian dollar against the u.s. dollar and euro.
income taxes.    our effective income tax rate increased to 19.8% for the year ended june 30, 2016 from 19.0% for the year ended june 30, 2015. during the year ended june 30, 2016, we adopted the new accounting standard, asu 2016-09 improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. as a result of adopting this standard, we recognized a tax benefit of $11.2 million. the impact of this tax benefit was offset by an additional tax expense relating to an increase in our foreign cash repatriation to the u.s. our effective income tax rate is affected by the geographic mix of our taxable income, including lower taxes associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations. our singapore and malaysia operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs which will expire in whole or in part at various dates through june 30, 2020. as of june 30, 2016, we have not provided for u.s. income taxes for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. we intend for these earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states.
net income and earnings per share.    as a result of the factors above, our net income for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $352.4 million compared to net income of $352.9 million for the year ended june 30, 2015. as a result of lower share count due to our stock repurchases during the year ended june 30, 2016, our earnings per share for the year ended june 30, 2016 was $2.49 per diluted share compared to $2.47 per diluted share for the year ended june 30, 2015, an increase of 1% over the year ended june 30, 2015.
liquidity and capital resources as of june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $821.9 million and $731.4 million, respectively. working capital was $1.3 billion and $0.8 billion, at june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016, respectively. as of june 30, 2017, we had $1.1 billion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility agreement.
as of june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalent balances held within the united states amounted to $23.2 million and $40.9 million, respectively. our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at june 30, 2017 and june 30, 2016, of $798.7 million and $690.5 million, respectively, were held by our non-u.s. subsidiaries, indefinitely invested outside the united states. our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.
as of june 30, 2017, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries was approximately $1.5 billion, and those undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. we intend to reinvest the cash and cash equivalents of those entities whose undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested in our international operations. we reassess our reinvestment intentions each reporting period and currently believe that we have sufficient sources of liquidity to support our assertion that the undistributed earnings held by foreign subsidiaries may be considered to be reinvested permanently. if these earnings had not been permanently reinvested, deferred taxes of approximately $358 million would have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements.
we repatriated $215 million and $190 million to the u.s. in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. the amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the u.s. in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2018 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the u.s., such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations. the majority of our repatriation of foreign subsidiaries earnings to the u.s. has historically occurred at year-end, although we may repatriate funds earlier in the year based on our business needs, as we did during the year ended june 30, 2017. when we repatriate funds to the u.s., we are required to pay taxes in the u.s. on these amounts based on applicable u.s. tax rates, net of any foreign tax that would be allowed to be deducted or taken as a credit against u.s. income tax. we paid $24.6 million and $34.2 million in additional u.s. federal income taxes in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, as a result of repatriation of foreign earnings generated in those years.
inventories at june 30, 2017 increased by $43.9 million or 20% to $268.3 million compared to june 30, 2016 inventories of $224.5 million. the increase in inventories was required to support our revenue growth and new product introductions.
accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, at june 30, 2017 were $450.5 million, an increase of $68.4 million or 18% over the june 30, 2016 accounts receivable balance of $382.1 million. accounts receivable days sales outstanding of 68 days at june 30, 2017 increased by 5 days compared to 63 days at june 30, 2016. our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total accounts receivable at june 30, 2017 and 2016 was 2.4% and 3.2%, respectively. we believe the credit quality of our customers remains broadly consistent with our past experience.
during the year ended june 30, 2017, we generated cash of $414.1 million from operations. this was lower than the cash generated from operations for the year ended june 30, 2016 of $547.9 million, which was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable and corporate income tax payments. movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended june 30, 2017 had the effect of increasing our cash and cash equivalents by $21.2 million, as reported in u.s. dollars. during fiscal year 2016, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to acquisitions. accordingly, we did not purchase any shares during fiscal year 2017. during fiscal year 2016, we repurchased 1.9 million shares at a cost of $102.1 million. during fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we also paid dividends totaling $186.3 million and $168.1 million, respectively.
capital leases                           488                  244                      133                   111                 -                     -                       -

*these guarantees mainly relate to requirements under contractual obligations with insurance companies transacting with our german subsidiaries and guarantees provided under our facility leasing obligations.
refer to note 19 legal actions and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details of our contingent obligations under recourse provisions.
segment information we have determined that we predominantly operate in a single operating segment, which is the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry. due to the acquisition of brightree llc in april 2016, our operations now include the supply of business management software and services to medical equipment and home health providers. however, these operations, both in terms of revenue and profit, are not material to our global operations and therefore have not been separately reported as a segment. see note 15  segment information of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
credit facility on october 31, 2013, we entered into a revolving credit agreement, as borrower, with lenders, including union bank, n.a., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, swing line lender and letters of credit issuer, and hsbc bank usa, national association, as syndication agent and joint lead arranger, providing for a revolving credit facility of $700 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300 million. on april 4, 2016, in connection with our acquisition of brightree llc (brightree), we entered into a first amendment to the revolving credit agreement to increase the size of the revolving credit facility from $700 million to $1 billion, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300 million, and to make other modifications to provide for the acquisition of brightree. on january 9, 2017, we entered into a second amendment to our agreement with our existing lenders, including mufg union bank, n.a. as successor in interest to union bank, n.a., as administrative agent, joint lead arranger, swing line lender and l/c issuer; and hsbc bank usa, national association, as syndication agent and joint lead arranger. the second amendment, among other things, increases the size of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility from $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional $300 million. the credit facility terminates on october 31, 2018, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. the outstanding principal amount due under the credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus 1.0% to 2.0% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio). at june 30, 2017, the interest rate that was being charged on the outstanding principal amount was 2.7%. a commitment fee of 0.15% to 0.25% (depending on the then-applicable leverage ratio) applies on the unused portion of the credit facility. the credit facility also includes a $25 million sublimit for letters of credit.
our obligations under the revolving credit agreement (as amended) are unsecured but are guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect u. s. subsidiaries, including resmed corp.; resmed motor technologies inc.; birdie inc.; inova labs, inc.; brightree llc; brightree services llc; brightree home health & hospice llc; and strategic ar llc, under an unconditional guaranty. the credit agreement contains customary covenants, including certain financial covenants and an obligation that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio of funded debt to ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement) and an interest coverage ratio.
at june 30, 2017, we were in compliance with our debt covenants and there was $1,080.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
we expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and long-term debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt facilities.
term loan on april 4, 2016, in connection with the brightree acquisition, we also entered into a credit agreement, or the term loan credit agreement, providing a $300 million senior unsecured one-year term loan credit facility. the proceeds from the funding of the term loan credit facility were used to pay a portion of the acquisition consideration for the brightree acquisition, as well as to pay fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition, the amendment to the revolving credit agreement and the term loan credit agreement. on march 30, 2017 we drew down $300 million from the revolving credit facility to pay off all outstanding amounts under the term loan credit facility, in advance of the scheduled termination of the term loan credit facility on april 3, 2017.
tax expense our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the jurisdictions where our income is recognized. to date, a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was 30% in fiscal years june 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. during fiscal years june 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between 18% and 20%. these and future effective tax rate fluctuations resulted from and depend on numerous factors including the level of foreign earnings repatriated to the u.s.; the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits and benefits available to us under applicable tax laws, including the lower statutory tax rates and incentives associated with our singapore and malaysia manufacturing operations, and any future changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
critical accounting principles and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory adjustments, warranty obligations, goodwill, impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes, deferred tax valuation allowances and stock-based compensation costs.
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
(1)    allowance for doubtful accounts. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which results in bad debt expense. we determine the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating individual customer receivables, considering a customers financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
(2)    inventory adjustments. inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first-in, first-out method. we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales. the likelihood of any material inventory write-downs depends on changes in competitive conditions, new product introductions by us or our competitors, or rapid changes in customer demand.
(3)    valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. we make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segment. the criteria used for these evaluations include managements estimate of the assets continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives. if assets are considered to be impaired, we recognize as impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value. we base useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the assets ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.
we conducted our annual review for goodwill impairment during the final quarter of fiscal 2017, which indicated that no impaired goodwill exists as the fair value for each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
(4)    income tax. we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. if we determine that it is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. alternatively, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. these changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results.
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. although currently immaterial, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. based on our regular assessment, we may adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
(5)    provision for warranty. we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. we determine the amount of this provision by using a financial model, which takes into consideration actual historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products. we use this financial model to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision. although we engage in product improvement programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures. should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates, we would be required to revise our estimated warranty provision.
(6)    revenue recognition. we generally record revenue on product sales at the time of shipment, which is when title transfers to the customer. we initially defer service revenue received in advance from service contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the service contract. we initially defer revenue we receive in advance from rental unit contracts and recognize that deferred revenue ratably over the life of the rental contract. otherwise, we recognize revenue from rental unit contracts ratably over the life of the rental contract. we include in revenue freight charges we bill to customers. we charge all freight-related expenses to cost of sales. taxes assessed by government authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions, such as sales and value added taxes, are excluded from revenue.
we do not normally offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products, other than returns for product defects or other warranty claims. we do not recognize revenues if we offer a right of return or variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities. however, as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders, one-time special pricing to support new product introductions, sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price-breaks for regular order volumes. we record the costs of all such programs as an adjustment to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized. our products are predominantly therapy-based equipment and require no installation. therefore, we have no significant installation obligations. for multiple-element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method. the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence.
we also generate revenue from time-based licensing of our software and associated services. in most instances, revenue is generated under sales agreements with multiple elements comprising subscription fees and professional services, which typically have contract terms of one to three years. we evaluate each element in these multiple-element arrangements to determine whether they represent a separate unit of accounting and recognize each element as the services are performed.
(7)    stock-based compensation. we measure the compensation cost of all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant. we recognize that value as compensation expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. we estimate the fair value of employee stock options and purchase rights granted using a black-scholes valuation model. the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards, the expected dividend per share and the expected life of the awards. the risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon the u.s. treasury yield curve at the time of grant appropriate for the expected life of the awards. expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options. we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends. while there is a tradeable market of options on our common stock, less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options. in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we use historical rates by employee groups. the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. the aforementioned inputs entered into the black-scholes valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary.
we estimate the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of the underlying shares as determined at the grant date less the fair value of dividends that holders are not entitled to, during the vesting period. we estimate the weighted average grant date fair value of performance restricted stock units, or prsus, which contain a market condition, using a monte-carlo simulation valuation model.
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 3  new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of june 30, 2017, we are not involved in any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k promulgated by the sec.

item 1a. risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995
the reports, filings, and other public announcements of williams may contain or incorporate by reference statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. such statements are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended (securities act) and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (exchange act). these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management's plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions, and other matters. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
all statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events, or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as "anticipates," "believes," "seeks," "could," "may," "should," "continues," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "intends," "might," "goals," "objectives," "targets," "planned," "potential," "projects," "scheduled," "will," "assumes," "guidance," "outlook," "in-service date," or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding:
•   expected levels of cash distributions by wpz with respect to limited partner interests;
•   future credit ratings of williams, wpz, and their affiliates;
•   amounts and nature of future capital expenditures;
•   expected in-service dates for capital projects;
•   financial condition and liquidity;
•   seasonality of certain business components;
forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties, and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:
•   availability of supplies, including lower than anticipated volumes from third parties served by our midstream business, and market demand;
•   volatility of pricing including the effect of lower than anticipated energy commodity prices and margins;
•   inflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on our customers and suppliers);
•   the strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition;
•   whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate, and timely execute our capital projects and other investment opportunities in accordance with our forecasted capital expenditures budget;
•   our ability to successfully expand our facilities and operations;
•   the impact of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions, and the availability of adequate insurance coverage;
•   the impact of existing and future laws (including, but not limited to, the tax cuts and job acts of 2017), regulations, the regulatory environment, environmental liabilities, and litigation, as well as our ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals and achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes;
•   our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans;
•   changes in the current geopolitical situation;
•   our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties;
•   risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from debt agreements, future changes in credit ratings as determined by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, and the availability and cost of capital;
•   the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate;
•   risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities;
•   acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions;
•   additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec).
in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise.
because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section.
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and, in some cases our reputation. the occurrence of any of such risks could also adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.
risks related to our business the financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve.
our ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. we do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. in addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital could adversely affect the development and production of additional natural gas reserves, the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities and the import and export of natural gas supplies. localized low natural gas prices in one or more of our existing supply basins, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas made available to us. the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation, and processing facilities.
demand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy, as well as technological advances and renewable sources of energy, could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business.
a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
prices for natural gas, ngls, oil, and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain our existing businesses.
our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of natural gas, ngls, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of current low commodity prices, or a further decline in commodity prices. price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. price volatility has and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
the markets for natural gas, ngls, oil, and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including:
•   worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, oil, and related commodities;
•   the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries;
•   the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks;
•   the availability of pipeline capacity;
•   the price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil;
•   the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold.
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, including chesapeake energy corporation and its affiliates, and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk.
we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy, or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. in a low commodity price environment certain of our customers could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress including, in some cases, to file for bankruptcy protection or to renegotiate contracts. to the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with the customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code, or may be renegotiated. further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. for example, chesapeake
energy corporation and its affiliates, which accounted for approximately 10 percent of our 2017 consolidated revenues, have experienced significant, negative financial results due to sustained low commodity prices. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take or are unable to take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness, and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
as part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. we have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. these are processes we use to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. we may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. if we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner.
our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines, and facilities, ngl transportation, or fractionation or storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities. in the current environment, we may face political opposition by landowners, environmental activists, and others resulting in the delay and/or denial of required governmental permits. additional risks associated with construction may include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed, on time or at all, and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that:
•   we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets;
•   we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate;
•   acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, and procedures;
•   acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access capital markets or obtain acceptable terms.
if realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, or cash flows.
we may face opposition to the construction and operation of our pipelines and facilities from various groups.
we may face opposition to the construction and operation of our pipelines and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. such opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving
our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the operation of our assets and business. in addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. any such event that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
•   the amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow;
•   the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements;
•   the cost of acquisitions, if any.
a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage, and a decrease in the value of our stock price.
our partnership interest in wpz is our largest cash-generating asset. therefore, we are indirectly exposed to all of the risks to which wpz is subject, as our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of wpz to make distributions to its partners. a significant decline in wpz's earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us.
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, williams partners l.p. as such, this subsidiary's operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations.
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz, a publicly traded limited partnership. this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken contractual obligations with respect to wpz as the general partner and to the limited partners of wpz. activities, determined to involve such obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. our control of the general partner of wpz may increase the possibility of claims of breach of such duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts of interest that may arise between wpz, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner's affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material.
our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.
we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. any current or future competitor that delivers natural gas, ngls, or other commodities into the areas that we operate could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price, location, facilities or other factors. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion, or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. failure to successfully
compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
we do not own all of the interests in the partially owned entities, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and control these assets in a manner beneficial to us.
because we do not control the partially owned entities, we may have limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. the partially owned entities' organizational documents generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis; however, in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating the businesses. as of december 31, 2017, our investments in the partially owned entities accounted for approximately 7 percent of our total consolidated assets. conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our partially owned entities, on the other hand, with regard to our partially owned entities' governance, business, or operations. if a conflict of interest arises between us and a partially owned entity, other owners may control the partially owned entity's actions with respect to such matter (subject to certain limitations), which could be detrimental to our business. any future disagreements with the other co-owners of these assets could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic or industry conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we will conduct certain operations through joint ventures that may limit our operational flexibility or require us to make additional capital contributions.
some of our operations are conducted through joint venture arrangements, and we may enter additional joint ventures in the future. in a joint venture arrangement, we have less operational flexibility, as actions must be taken in accordance with the applicable governing provisions of the joint venture. in certain cases:
•   we cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to these operations;
•   we are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures;
•   we may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets;
•   we have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations.
in addition, joint venture participants may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay substantial carried costs pertaining to the joint venture and to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture, the performance of which is outside our control. similarly, if we fail to make a required capital contribution under the applicable governing provisions of a joint venture arrangement, we could be deemed to be in default under the joint venture agreement. joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, and disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.
the risks described above or the failure to continue joint ventures, or to resolve disagreements with joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations that are the subject of any joint venture, which could in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow.
we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•   the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative sources, such as electricity, renewable resources, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy;
•   natural gas and ngl prices, demand, availability, and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact our ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems;
•   general economic, financial markets, and industry conditions;
•   our ability to understand our customers' expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. the results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market.
our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a "negotiated rate" that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these "negotiated rate" contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.
some of our businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers.
some of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. if a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services, such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. if our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.
certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
an impairment of our assets, including goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings.
gaap requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. the outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity method investments. additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings.
there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including:
•   damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment;
•   security risks, including cybersecurity;
any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to us. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. an event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance.
we do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims.
in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to repay our debt.
our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers' assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. a significant disruption in our or our customers' operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
our business could be negatively impacted by acts of terrorism and security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions.
given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store, and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. a terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport, or distribute natural gas, ngls, or other commodities. acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants, and assets. we could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, "hacktivists", or private individuals. the age, operating systems, or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. we could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, could result in damage to our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected.
we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver
natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated, or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns.
we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.
we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited terms. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
in recent years, stockholder activism, including threatened or actual proxy contests, has been directed against numerous public companies, including ours. during the latter part of fiscal year 2016, we were the target of a proxy contest from a stockholder activist, which resulted in our incurring significant costs. if stockholder activists were to again take or threaten to take actions against the company or seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction or operations of the company, we could incur significant costs as well as the distraction of management, which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results. in addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.
litigation pertaining to the etc merger, including litigation related to energy transfer equity, l.p.'s (ete's) termination of and failure to close the etc merger, may negatively impact our business and operations.
we have incurred and may continue to incur additional costs in connection with the prosecution, defense or settlement of the currently pending and any future litigation relating to the etc merger or ete's termination of and failure to close the etc merger. we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. such litigation may also create a distraction for our management team and board of directors and require time and attention. in addition, any litigation relating to the etc merger or ete's termination of and failure to close the etc merger could, among other things, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control.
we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other postretirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates, and changes in pension laws.
changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, or unavailability of contract labor may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including with the workforce needs associated with projects and ongoing operations. failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate the businesses. if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted.
if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc. (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying a u.s. internal revenue service (irs) private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities.
in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities.
the wpx spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with wpx.
the spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. a court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. under the separation and distribution agreement between us and wpx, from and after the spin-off, each of wpx and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities, and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to wpx, particularly if wpx were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations.
risks related to financing our business downgrades of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, impact our liquidity, access to capital, and our costs of doing business.
downgrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. in addition, our ability to access capital markets could continue to be limited by the downgrading of our credit ratings.
credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market, and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. as of the date of the filing of this report, we have been assigned below investment-grade credit ratings by each of the three credit ratings agencies.
our ability to obtain credit in the future could be affected by wpz's credit ratings.
a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through, and our cash flows are substantially derived from, distributions paid to us by wpz. due to our relationship with wpz, our ability to obtain credit will be affected by wpz's credit ratings. if wpz were to experience a deterioration in its credit standing or financial condition, our access to capital, and our ratings could be adversely affected. any future downgrading of a wpz credit rating could also result in a downgrading of our credit rating. a downgrading of a wpz credit rating could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future upon favorable terms, if at all.
difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations.
our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. in addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal and monetary policies. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manner described above.
restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility.
the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our, and our material subsidiaries', ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants, and other limitations with which we will need to comply.
•   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness;
•   impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes;
•   diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes, or other purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.
our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.
our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read note 13 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.
increases in interest rates could adversely impact our share price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels.
interest rates may increase in the future. as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. as with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our dividends and implied dividend yield. the dividend yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels.
our hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results.
in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used, and may in the future use, fixed-price, forward, physical purchase, and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract's counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default.
risks related to regulations the natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return.
in addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, under the natural gas act of 1938, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. federal regulation extends to such matters as:
•   rates, operating terms, types of services, and conditions of service;
•   certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities;
•   acquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities;
•   relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business;
•   market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases, or transportation of natural gas.
regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business.
public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations.
certain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance.
in addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by our businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner which differs from prior regulatory action. new laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might also be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers, or our business activities. if new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process, and treat could decline, our compliance costs could increase, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of industrial facilities. substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, and delays or denials in granting permits.
joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours.
we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses.
in addition, climate change regulations and the costs associated with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) have the potential to affect our business. regulatory actions by the environmental protection agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, or administer and manage our ghg compliance program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. climate change and ghg regulation could also reduce demand for our services.
we expect that certain aspects of tax cuts and jobs act signed into law on december 22, 2017 (tax reform), including regulatory liabilities relating to reduced corporate federal income tax rates, could adversely impact our financial condition and our future financial results.
certain of the rates we charge to our customers are subject to the rate-making policies of the ferc. these policies permit us to include in our cost-of-service an income tax allowance that includes a deferred income tax component. the recently enacted tax reform makes significant changes to the u.s. federal income tax rules applicable to both individuals and entities, including among other things, a reduction in corporate federal income tax rates. although we expect the decreased federal income tax rates will require us to return amounts to certain customers for this item through future rates and have recognized a regulatory liability, the details of any regulatory implementation guidance remain uncertain.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an energy infrastructure company focused on connecting north america's significant hydrocarbon resource plays to growing markets for natural gas and ngls. our operations are located principally in the united states. we have one reportable segment, williams partners. all remaining business activities are included in other.
williams partners williams partners consists of our consolidated master limited partnership, wpz, which includes gas pipeline and midstream businesses. the gas pipeline businesses include interstate natural gas pipelines and pipeline joint project investments; and the midstream businesses provide natural gas gathering, treating, and processing services; ngl production, fractionation, storage, marketing, and transportation; deepwater production handling and crude oil transportation services; and are comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries and joint project investments. as of december 31, 2017, we own 74 percent of the interests in wpz.
williams partners' gas pipeline businesses consist primarily of transco and northwest pipeline. the gas pipeline business also holds interests in joint venture interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline systems including a 50 percent equity-method investment in gulfstream and a 41 percent interest in constitution (a consolidated entity), which is developing a pipeline project. (see note 3 - variable interest entities of notes to consolidated financial statements.) as of december 31, 2017, transco and northwest pipeline owned and operated a combined total of approximately 13,600 miles of pipelines with a total annual throughput of approximately 4,533 tbtu of natural gas and peak-day delivery capacity of approximately 18.8 mmdth of natural gas.
williams partners' midstream businesses primarily consist of (1) natural gas gathering, treating, compression, and processing; (2) ngl fractionation, storage, and transportation; (3) crude oil production handling and transportation; and (4) olefins production. (see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the primary service areas are concentrated in major producing basins in colorado, texas, oklahoma, kansas, new mexico, wyoming, the gulf of mexico, louisiana, pennsylvania, west virginia, new york, and ohio, which include the barnett, eagle ford, haynesville, marcellus, niobrara, and utica shale plays as well as the mid-continent region.
the midstream businesses include equity-method investments in natural gas gathering and processing assets and ngl fractionation and transportation assets, including a 62 percent equity-method investment in ueom, a 69 percent equity-method investment in laurel mountain, a 58 percent equity-method investment in caiman ii, a 60 percent equity-method investment in discovery, a 50 percent equity-method investment in oppl, and appalachia midstream services, llc, which owns an approximate average 66 percent equity-method investment interest in multiple gas gathering systems in the marcellus shale (appalachia midstream investments), as well as our previously owned 50 percent equity-method investment in the delaware basin gas gathering system (dbjv) in the mid-continent region (see note 5 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements).
the midstream businesses previously included canadian midstream operations, which were comprised of an oil sands offgas processing plant near fort mcmurray, alberta and an ngl/olefin fractionation facility at redwater, alberta. in september 2016, these canadian operations were sold.
williams partners' ongoing strategy is to safely and reliably operate large-scale, interstate natural gas transmission and midstream infrastructures where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. we focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers and investing in growing markets and areas of increasing natural gas demand.
williams partners' interstate transmission and related storage activities are subject to regulation by the ferc and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things, are subject to regulation. the rates are established through the ferc's ratemaking process. changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have
limited near-term impact on these revenues because the majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates.
other other is comprised of business activities that are not operating segments, as well as corporate operations. other also includes certain domestic olefins pipeline assets as well as certain canadian assets, which included a liquids extraction plant located near fort mcmurray, alberta, that began operations in march 2016, and a propane dehydrogenation facility which was under development. in september 2016, the canadian assets were sold.
financial repositioning in january 2017, we entered into agreements with wpz, wherein we permanently waived the general partner's idrs and converted our 2 percent general partner interest in wpz to a noneconomic interest in exchange for 289 million newly issued wpz common units. pursuant to this agreement, we also purchased approximately 277 thousand wpz common units for $10 million. additionally, we purchased approximately 59 million common units of wpz at a price of $36.08586 per unit in a private placement transaction, funded with proceeds from our equity offering (see note 14 - stockholders' equity of notes to consolidated financial statements). according to the terms of this agreement, concurrent with wpz's quarterly distributions in february 2017 and may 2017, we paid additional consideration totaling $56 million to wpz for these units. subsequent to these transactions and as of december 31, 2017, we own a 74 percent limited partner interest in wpz.
unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and liquidity relates to our current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii, item 8 of this report.
overview net income (loss) attributable to the williams companies, inc., for the year ended december 31, 2017, changed favorably by $2.598 billion compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, reflecting a $1.949 billion improvement in the provision (benefit) for income taxes primarily due to tax reform, the absence of $430 million of impairments of equity-method investments incurred in 2016, a $219 million increase in other investing income (loss) - net primarily associated with the disposition of certain equity-method investments in 2017, a $204 million increase in operating income and reduced interest expense, partially offset by a $261 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily due to increased income at wpz. the increase in operating income reflects a gain of $1.095 billion from the sale of our geismar interest, increased service revenue from expansion projects, and lower costs and expenses, partially offset by a $674 million regulatory charge resulting from tax reform, a $375 million increase in impairments of certain assets, and a $184 million decrease in product margins primarily due to the loss of olefins volumes as a result of the sale of our gulf olefins and canadian operations.
tax reform in december 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted, which, among other things, reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent (tax reform). as a result, we have remeasured our existing deferred income tax assets and liabilities, to reflect the expected future realization of existing temporary differences at the lower income tax rate. this resulted in the recognition of a net income tax provision benefit of $1.923 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017. certain adjustments within the provision benefit are considered provisional and are potentially subject to change in the future. (see note 7 - provision (benefit) for income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
transco and northwest pipeline have recognized regulatory liabilities to reflect the probable return to customers through future rates of the future decrease in income taxes payable associated with tax reform. these liabilities represent an obligation to return amounts directly to our customers. the regulatory liabilities were recorded in december 2017 through regulatory charges to operating income totaling $674 million. (see note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the timing and actual amount of such return will be subject to future negotiations regarding this matter and many other elements of cost-of-service rate proceedings, including other costs of providing service.
revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of accounting standards update 2014-09, revenues from contracts with customers (asc 606), we expect that our 2018 revenues will increase in situations where we receive noncash consideration, which exists primarily in certain of our gas processing contracts where we receive commodities as full or partial consideration for services provided. this increase in revenues will be offset by a similar increase in costs and expenses when the commodities received are subsequently sold. based on commodities received during 2017 as consideration for services and market prices during 2017, we estimate the impact to revenues and costs would have been approximately $350 million.
additionally, we expect future revenues will be impacted by application of the new accounting standard to certain contracts for which we received prepayments for services and have recorded deferred revenue (contract liabilities). for these contracts, which underwent modifications in periods prior to january 1, 2018, the modification is treated as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract. the new accounting guidance requires that the transaction price, including any remaining deferred revenue from the old contract, be allocated to the performance obligations over the term of the new contract. as a result, we will recognize the deferred revenue over longer periods than application of revenue recognition under accounting guidance prior to january 1, 2018. the application of asc 606 to prior periods related to these contracts would have resulted in lower revenues in 2016 and 2017. revenues will also be lower in 2018 and 2019 than what would have been recorded under the previous guidance, offset by increased revenues in later reporting periods given the longer period of recognition.
we are adopting asc 606 utilizing the modified retrospective transition approach, effective january 1, 2018, by recognizing the cumulative effect of initially applying asc 606 for periods prior to january 1, 2018, which we expect to result in a decrease of approximately $255 million, net of tax, to the opening balance of total equity in the consolidated balance sheet. this adjustment is primarily associated with the impact to the timing of deferred revenue (contract liabilities) for certain contracts as noted above.
pension deferred vested benefit early payout program in september 2017, we initiated a program to pay out certain deferred vested pension benefits to reduce investment risk, cash funding volatility, and administrative costs. in december 2017, the lump-sum payments were made and the annuity payments were commenced in relation to this program. as a result of these lump-sum payments, as well as lump-sum benefit payments made throughout 2017, settlement accounting was required. we settled $261 million in liabilities and recognized a pre-tax, non-cash settlement charge of $71 million. (see note 9 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
expansion project completions virginia southside ii in december 2017, the virginia southside ii expansion project to the transco system was placed into service. the project expanded transco's existing natural gas transmission system together with greenfield facilities to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from our station 210 in new jersey and our station 165 in virginia to a new lateral extending from our brunswick lateral in virginia. the project increased capacity by 250 mdth/d.
new york bay expansion in october 2017, the new york bay expansion to the transco system was placed into service. the project expanded transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 195 in pennsylvania to the rockaway delivery lateral transfer point and the narrows meter station in new york. the project increased capacity by 115 mdth/d.
dalton in august 2017, the dalton expansion to the transco system was placed into service. this project expanded transco's existing natural gas transmission system together with greenfield facilities to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from our station 210 in new jersey to markets in northwest georgia. on april 1, 2017, we began providing firm transportation service through the mainline portion of the project on an interim basis and we placed the full project into service in august 2017. the project increased capacity by 448 mdth/d.
hillabee in july 2017, phase i of the hillabee expansion project was placed into service. the project involves an expansion of transco's existing natural gas transmission system from our station 85 in west central alabama to a new interconnection with the sabal trail pipeline in alabama. the project will be constructed in phases, and all of the project expansion capacity is dedicated to sabal trail pursuant to a capacity lease agreement. we placed a portion of phase i into service in june of 2017 and the remainder of phase i into service in july of 2017. phase i increased capacity by 818 mdth/d. the in-service date of phase ii is planned for the second quarter of 2020 and together they are expected to increase capacity by 1,025 mdth/d.
in march 2016, wpz entered into an agreement with the member-sponsors of sabal trail to resolve several matters. in accordance with the agreement, the member-sponsors paid us an aggregate amount of $240 million in three equal installments as certain milestones of the project were met. the first $80 million payment was received in march 2016, the second installment was received in september 2016 and the third installment was received in july 2017. wpz expects to recognize income associated with these receipts over the term of the capacity lease agreement.
in august 2017, the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit granted an appeal of the ferc certificate order for the southeast market pipelines projects (a group of related projects, including the hillabee expansion project) filed by certain non-governmental organizations. in doing so, the court (i) remanded the matter to the ferc for preparation of an environmental impact statement (eis) that conforms with the court's opinion regarding quantifying certain greenhouse gas emissions, and (ii) vacated the ferc's certificate order for the projects, which would be effective following the court's mandate (by court order, the mandate will not issue until after disposition of all petitions for rehearing). we, along with other intervenors, and the ferc filed petitions for rehearing with the court to overturn the remedy that would involve vacating the ferc certificate order, but on january 31, 2018 the court denied the petitions. in compliance with the court's directive, on february 5, 2018, the ferc issued a final supplemental eis for the projects, reaffirming that while the projects would result in temporary and permanent impacts on the environment, those impacts would not be significant. on february 6, 2018, we, along with other intervenors, and the ferc filed motions with the court to stay the issuance of the mandate in order to give the ferc time to re-issue the authorizations for the projects. the filing of the motions automatically stays the effectiveness of the court's mandate. if the court's mandate is issued prior to the ferc re-issuing the authorizations for the projects, we believe that the ferc will take the necessary steps (which may include issuing temporary certificate authority) to avoid any lapse in federal authorization for the projects.
geismar olefins facility monetization in july 2017, wpz completed the sale of its geismar interest for $2.084 billion in cash. wpz received a final working capital adjustment of $12 million in october 2017. additionally, wpz entered into a long-term supply and transportation agreement with the purchaser to provide feedstock to the plant via its bayou ethane pipeline system, which is expected to provide a long-term, fee-based revenue stream. (see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
following this sale, the cash proceeds were used to repay wpz's $850 million term loan. wpz has also been using these proceeds to fund a portion of the capital and investment expenditures that are a part of its growth portfolio.
acquisition of additional interests in appalachia midstream investments during the first quarter of 2017, wpz exchanged all of its 50 percent interest in dbjv for an increased interest in two natural gas gathering systems that are part of the appalachia midstream investments and $155 million in cash. following this exchange, wpz has an approximate average 66 percent interest in the appalachia midstream investments. wpz also sold all of its interest in ranch westex jv llc for $45 million. these transactions resulted in a total gain of $269 million reflected in other investing income (loss) - net in the consolidated statement of operations within the williams partners segment. (see note 5 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
commodity prices ngl per-unit margins were approximately 62 percent higher in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a 42 percent increase in per-unit non-ethane prices. the per-unit margin increase also reflects the absence of our former canadian operations which had lower per-unit non-ethane margins in the prior year compared to our domestic operations. these favorable impacts were partially offset by an approximate 26 percent increase in per-unit natural gas feedstock prices.
ngl margins are defined as ngl revenues less any applicable btu replacement cost, plant fuel, and third-party transportation and fractionation. per-unit ngl margins are calculated based on sales of our own equity volumes at the processing plants. our equity volumes include ngls where we own the rights to the value from ngls recovered at our plants under both "keep-whole" processing agreements, where we have the obligation to replace the lost heating value with natural gas, and "percent-of-liquids" agreements whereby we receive a portion of the extracted liquids with no obligation to replace the lost heating value.
the potential impact of commodity prices on our business is further discussed in the following company outlook.
company outlook our strategy is to provide large-scale energy infrastructure designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exists in the united states. we accomplish this by connecting the growing demand for cleaner fuels and feedstocks with our major positions in the premier natural gas and natural gas products supply basins. we continue to maintain a strong commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction. we believe that accomplishing these goals will position us to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers and an attractive return to our shareholders.
our business plan for 2018 includes a continued focus on growing our fee-based businesses, executing growth projects and accomplishing cost discipline initiatives to ensure operations support our strategy. we anticipate operating results will increase through organic business growth driven primarily by transco expansion projects and continued growth in the northeast region. wpz intends to fund planned growth capital with retained cash flow and debt, and based on currently forecasted projects, does not expect to access public equity markets for the next several years.
our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2018 are expected to be approximately $2.7 billion. approximately $1.7 billion of our growth capital funding needs include transco expansions and other interstate pipeline growth projects, most of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements. the remaining growth capital spending in 2018 primarily reflects investment in gathering and processing systems in the northeast region limited primarily to known new producer volumes, including volumes that support transco expansion projects including our atlantic sunrise project. in addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments.
as a result of our significant continued capital and investment expenditures on transco expansions and fee-based gathering and processing projects, fee-based businesses are a significant component of our portfolio and serve to reduce the influence of commodity price fluctuations on our operating results and cash flows. we expect to benefit as continued growth in demand for low-cost natural gas is driven by increases in lng exports, industrial demand and power generation. for 2018, current forward market prices indicate oil prices are expected to be higher compared to 2017, while natural gas and ngl prices are expected to be lower or comparable with 2017. we continue to address certain pricing risks through the utilization of commodity hedging strategies. however, some of our customers may continue to curtail or delay drilling plans until there is a more sustained recovery in prices, which may negatively impact our gathering and processing volumes. the credit profiles of certain of our producer customers have been, and may continue to be, challenged as a result of lower energy commodity prices. unfavorable changes in energy commodity prices or the credit profile of our producer customers may also result in noncash impairments of our assets.
in 2018, our operating results are expected to include increases from our regulated transco fee-based business, primarily related to projects recently placed in-service or expected to be placed in-service in 2018 including the atlantic sunrise project. for our non-regulated businesses, we anticipate increases in fee-based revenue in the northeast region, partially offset by lower fee-based revenue in the west region. as previously discussed, under the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition, deferred revenue under certain contracts will be recognized over longer periods than under the prior guidance, resulting in a decrease in revenue for the west region. we expect overall gathering and processing volumes to grow in 2018 and increase thereafter to meet the growing demand for natural gas and natural gas products. we also anticipate lower general and administrative expenses due to the full year impact of prior year cost reduction initiatives.
•   certain aspects of tax reform, including regulatory liabilities relating to reduced corporate federal income tax rates, could adversely impact the rates we can charge on our regulated pipelines;
•   opposition to infrastructure projects, including the risk of delay or denial in permits and approvals needed for our projects;
•   unexpected significant increases in capital expenditures or delays in capital project execution;
•   counterparty credit and performance risk, including that of chesapeake energy corporation and its affiliates;
•   lower than anticipated demand for natural gas and natural gas products which could result in lower than expected volumes, energy commodity prices and margins;
•   physical damages to facilities, including damage to offshore facilities by named windstorms;
•   other risks set forth under part i, item 1a. risk factors in this report.
we seek to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity, as well as manage a diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets which continue to serve key growth markets and supply basins in the united states.
atlantic sunrise in february 2017, we received approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system along with greenfield facilities to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from the northeastern marcellus producing area to markets along transco's mainline as far south as station 85 in west central alabama. we placed a portion of the mainline project facilities into service in september 2017 and it increased capacity by 400 mdth/d. we plan to place the full project into service during mid-2018, assuming timely receipt of all remaining regulatory approvals. the full project is expected to increase capacity by 1,700 mdth/d.
constitution pipeline we currently own 41 percent of constitution with three other parties holding 25 percent, 24 percent, and 10 percent, respectively. we are the operator of constitution. the 126-mile constitution pipeline is proposed to connect our gathering system in susquehanna county, pennsylvania, to the iroquois gas transmission and tennessee gas pipeline systems in new york, as well as to a local distribution company serving new york and pennsylvania.
in december 2014, constitution received approval from the ferc to construct and operate its proposed pipeline, which will have an expected capacity of 650 mdth/d. however, in april 2016, the new york state department of environmental conservation (nysdec) denied the necessary water quality certification under section 401 of the clean water act for the new york portion of the pipeline. in may 2016, constitution appealed the nysdec's denial of the section 401 certification to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit and in august 2017, the court issued a decision denying in part and dismissing in part constitution's appeal. the court expressly declined to rule on constitution's argument that the delay in the nysdec's decision on constitution's section 401 application constitutes a waiver of the certification requirement. the court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to address that contention, and found that jurisdiction over the waiver issue lies exclusively with the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit. as to the denial itself, the court determined that nysdec's action was not arbitrary or capricious. constitution filed a petition for rehearing with the second circuit court of appeals, but in october the court denied our petition.
in october 2017, we filed a petition for declaratory order requesting the ferc to find that, by operation of law, the section 401 certification requirement for the new york state portion of constitution's pipeline project was waived due to the failure by the nysdec to act on constitution's section 401 application within a reasonable period of time as required by the express terms of such statute. in january 2018, the ferc denied our petition, finding that section 401 provides that a state waives certification only when it does not act on an application within one year from the date of the application.
the project's sponsors remain committed to the project, and, in that regard, we are pursuing two separate and independent paths in order to overturn the nysdec's denial of the section 401 certification. in january 2018, we filed a petition with the united states supreme court to review the decision of the second circuit court of appeals that upheld the merits of the nysdec's denial of the section 401 certification. and, in february 2018, we filed a request with the ferc for rehearing of its finding that the nysdec did not waive the section 401 certification requirement. if the ferc denies such request, we will file a petition for review with the d.c. circuit court of appeals.
we estimate that the target in-service date for the project would be approximately 10 to 12 months following any court or ferc decision that the nysdec denial order was improper or that the nysdec waived the section 401 certification requirement. (see note 3 - variable interest entities of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
garden state in april 2016, we received approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 210 in new jersey to a new interconnection
on our trenton woodbury lateral in new jersey. the project will be constructed in phases and is expected to increase capacity by 180 mdth/d. we placed the initial phase of the project into service in september 2017 and plan to place the remaining portion of the project into service during the first quarter of 2018.
gateway in november 2017, we filed an application with the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from penneast pipeline company's proposed interconnection with transco's mainline south of station 205 in new jersey to other existing transco meter stations within new jersey. we plan to place the project into service in the first quarter of 2021, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. the project is expected to increase capacity by 65 mdth/d.
gulf connector in november 2017, we received approval from the ferc allowing transco to expand its existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 65 in louisiana to delivery points in wharton and san patricio counties, texas. the project will be constructed in two phases and we plan to place both phases into service during the first half of 2019, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. the project is expected to increase capacity by 475 mdth/d.
hillabee in february 2016, the ferc issued a certificate order for the initial phases of transco's hillabee expansion project. the project involves an expansion of transco's existing natural gas transmission system from station 85 in west central alabama to a new interconnection with the sabal trail pipeline in alabama. the project will be constructed in phases, and all of the project expansion capacity will be leased to sabal trail. we placed a portion of phase i into service in june of 2017 and the remainder of phase i into service in july of 2017. phase i increased capacity by 818 mdth/d. the in-service date of phase ii is planned for the second quarter of 2020 and together they are expected to increase capacity by 1,025 mdth/d. see expansion project completions within overview.
norphlet project in march 2016, we announced that we have reached an agreement to provide deepwater gas gathering services to the appomattox development in the gulf of mexico. the project will provide offshore gas gathering services to our existing transco lateral, which will provide transmission services onshore to our mobile bay processing facility. we also plan to make modifications to our main pass 261 platform to install an alternate delivery route from the platform, as well as modifications to our mobile bay processing facility. the project is scheduled to go into service during the second half of 2019.
north seattle lateral upgrade in may 2017, we filed an application with the ferc to expand delivery capabilities on northwest pipeline's north seattle lateral. the project consists of the removal and replacement of approximately 5.9 miles of 8-inch diameter pipeline with new 20-inch diameter pipeline. we plan to place the project into service as early as the fourth quarter of 2019. the project is expected to increase capacity by up to 159 mdth/d.
northeast supply enhancement in march 2017, we filed an application with the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 195 in pennsylvania to the rockaway delivery lateral transfer point in new york. we plan to place the project into service in late 2019 or during the first half of 2020, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. the project is expected to increase capacity by 400 mdth/d.
ohio river supply hub expansion we agreed to expand our services to a customer to provide 660 mmcf/d of processing wet gas capacity in the marcellus and upper devonian shale in west virginia. associated with this agreement, we expect to further expand the processing capacity of our oak grove facility, which has the ability to increase capacity by an additional 1.8 bcf/d. additionally, with the same customer, we secured a gathering dedication agreement to gather dry gas in this same region. these expansions will be supported by long-term, fee-based agreements and volumetric commitments.
rivervale south to market in august 2017, we filed an application with the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from the existing rivervale interconnection with tennessee gas pipeline on transco's north new jersey extension to other existing transco locations within new jersey. we plan to place the project into service as early as the fourth quarter of 2019, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. the project is expected to increase capacity by 190 mdth/d.
susquehanna supply hub expansion the susquehanna supply hub expansion, which involves two new compression facilities with an additional 49,000 horsepower and 59 miles of 12 inch to 24 inch pipeline, is expected to increase gathering capacity, allowing a certain producer to fulfill its commitment to deliver 850 mdth/d to our atlantic sunrise development. we placed a portion of this project into service in january 2018 and anticipate this expansion will be fully commissioned in the first quarter of 2018.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. we believe that the nature of these estimates and assumptions is material due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary, or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations.
pension and postretirement obligations we have employee benefit plans that include pension and other postretirement benefits. net periodic benefit cost and obligations for these plans are impacted by various estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, expected rate of compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, and employee demographics, including retirement age and mortality. these assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made as needed. the assumptions utilized to compute cost and the benefit obligations are shown in note 9 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements.
the following table presents the estimated increase (decrease) in net periodic benefit cost and obligations resulting from a one-percentage-point change in the specific assumption.
benefit cost                                                                                                                           benefit obligation one-percentage-pointincrease                 one-percentage-pointdecrease           one-percentage-pointincrease        one-percentage-pointdecrease

our expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, as determined at the beginning of each fiscal year, are based on the average rate of return expected on the funds invested in the plans. we determine our long-term expected rates of return on plan assets using our expectations of capital market results, which include an analysis of historical results as well as forward-looking projections. these capital market expectations are based on a period of at least 10 years and take into account our investment strategy and mix of assets. we develop our expectations using input from our third-party independent investment consultant. the forward-looking capital market projections start with current conditions of interest rates, equity pricing, economic growth, and inflation and those are overlaid with forward looking projections of normal inflation, growth, and interest rates to determine expected returns. the capital market return projections for specific asset classes in the investment portfolio are then applied to the relative weightings of the asset classes in the investment portfolio. the resulting rates are an estimate of future results and, thus, likely to be different than actual results.
in 2017, the benefit plans' assets outperformed their respective benchmarks for fixed income strategies, but generally underperformed the respective benchmarks for equity strategies. while the 2017 investment performance was greater than our expected rates of return, the expected rates of return on plan assets are long-term in nature and are not significantly impacted by short-term market performance. changes to our asset allocation would also impact these expected rates of return. our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used for our pension plans was 6.45 percent in 2017. the 2017 actual return on plan assets for our pension plans was approximately 15.5 percent. the 10-year average rate of return on pension plan assets through december 2017 was approximately 4.3 percent.
the discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the objective of the discount rates is to determine the amount, if invested at the december 31 measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt securities, that will provide the necessary cash flows when benefit payments are due. increases in the discount rates decrease the obligation and, generally, decrease the related cost. the discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined separately based on an approach specific to our plans and their respective expected benefit cash flows as described in note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies and note 9 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements. our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term, high-quality debt securities as well as by the duration of our plans' liabilities.
the assumed health care cost trend rates are based on national trend rates adjusted for our actual historical cost rates and plan design. an increase in this rate causes the other postretirement benefit obligation and cost to increase.
property, plant, and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets we evaluate our property, plant, and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in our judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. when an indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets to determine whether an impairment has occurred and we may apply a probability-weighted approach to consider the likelihood of different cash flow assumptions and possible outcomes including selling in the near term or holding for the remaining estimated useful life. if an impairment of the carrying value has occurred, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. this evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which separately identifiable cash flows exist.
during the third quarter of 2017, we received solicitations and engaged in negotiations for the sale of certain gas gathering assets within the mid-continent region. as a result of these events, we evaluated the mid-continent asset group, which includes property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets, for impairment. our evaluation considered the likelihood of divesting certain assets within the mid-continent region as well as information developed from the negotiation process that impacted our estimate of future cash flows associated with these assets. the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were determined to be below the carrying amount for these assets. we computed the
estimated fair value using an income approach and incorporated market inputs based on ongoing negotiations for the potential sale of a portion of the underlying assets. for the income approach, we utilized a discount rate of 10.2 percent, reflecting an estimated cost of capital and risks associated with the underlying assets. as a result of this evaluation, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.019 billion for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of these assets.
judgments and assumptions are inherent in estimating undiscounted future cash flows, fair values, and the probability-weighting of possible outcomes. the use of alternate judgments and assumptions could result in a different determination affecting the consolidated financial statements.
equity-method investments at december 31, 2017, our consolidated balance sheet includes approximately $6.6 billion of investments that are accounted for under the equity-method of accounting. we evaluate these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in our management's judgment, that the carrying value of such investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. we continue to monitor our equity-method investments for any indications that the carrying value may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. when evidence of a loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate of the fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. we generally estimate the fair value of our investments using an income approach where significant judgments and assumptions include expected future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate. in some cases, we may utilize a form of market approach to estimate the fair value of our investments.
as of december 31, 2017, the carrying value of our equity-method investment in discovery is $534 million. during the fourth quarter of 2017, certain customers of discovery terminated a significant offshore gas gathering agreement following the shut-in of production after the associated wells ceased flowing. as a result, we evaluated this investment for impairment and determined that no impairment was necessary.
we estimated the fair value of our investment in discovery using an income approach that primarily considered probability-weighted assumptions of additional commercial development, the continued operation of the business under existing contracts, and a discount rate of 11.3 percent. higher probabilities were generally assigned to those commercial development opportunities that were more advanced in the discussion and contracting process, utilizing existing infrastructure due to producer capital constraints, and/or we believe discovery has a competitive advantage due to geographical proximity to the prospect. the estimated fair value of our investment in discovery exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6 percent and thus no impairment was necessary.
judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimates of future cash flows, discount rates, and additional development probabilities. it is reasonably possible that an impairment could be required in the future if commercial development activities are not as successful or as timely as assumed. the use of alternate judgments and assumptions
could result in a different calculation of fair value, which could ultimately result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the consolidated financial statements.
constitution pipeline capitalized project costs as of december 31, 2017, property, plant, and equipment - net in our consolidated balance sheet includes approximately $381 million of capitalized project costs for constitution, for which we are the construction manager and own a 41 percent consolidated interest. as a result of the events discussed in company outlook, we evaluated the capitalized project costs for impairment as recently as december 31, 2017, and determined that no impairment was necessary. our evaluation considered probability-weighted scenarios of undiscounted future net cash flows, including scenarios assuming construction of the pipeline, as well as a scenario where the project does not proceed. these scenarios included our most recent estimate of total construction costs. the probability-weighted scenarios also considered our assessment of the likelihood of success of the two separate and independent paths to obtain necessary certification, as described in company outlook. it is reasonably possible that future unfavorable developments, such as a reduced likelihood of success, increased estimates of construction costs, or further significant delays, could result in a future impairment.
regulatory liabilities resulting from tax reform in december 2017, tax reform was enacted, which, among other things, reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. rates charged to customers of our regulated natural gas pipelines are subject to the rate-making policies of the ferc, which permit the recovery of an income tax allowance that includes a deferred income tax component. as a result of the reduced income tax rate from tax reform and the collection of historical rates that reflected historical federal income tax rates, we expect that our regulated natural gas pipelines will be required to return amounts to certain customers through future rates and have established regulatory liabilities accordingly. these liabilities were recorded in december 2017 through regulatory charges to operating income totaling $674 million. (see note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the timing and actual amount of such return will be subject to future negotiations regarding this matter and many other elements of cost-of-service rate proceedings, including other costs of providing service.
our estimation of these regulatory liabilities incorporated the following significant judgments and assumptions involving income taxes collected from our customers.
•   we utilized current ferc guidance for the default income tax rate for non-corporate taxpayers, which is an element of our overall effective tax rate. it is possible that the ferc will provide updated implementation guidance in the future, including an updated default income tax rate for non-corporate taxpayers. we estimate that a decline of one percentage point in our assumed overall effective tax rate would increase our regulatory liabilities by approximately $42 million.
•   we made assumptions regarding the allocation of wpz taxable income among the states in which wpz conducts business. this allocation is subject to annual variation that could impact the weighted average state tax component of the overall income tax allowance rate. it is possible that certain states may change their income tax laws and/or rates in the future in response to tax reform.
•   in determining the estimated liability that we currently believe is probable of return to customers through future rates, we considered the mix of services provided by our regulated natural gas pipelines, taking into consideration that certain of these services are provided under contractually-based rates, in lieu of recourse-based rates. the contractually-based rates are designed to recover the cost of providing those services, with
no expected future rate adjustment for the term of those contracts. we estimate that a one percent change in the relative mix of services would change the regulatory liability by approximately $8 million.
the use of alternative judgments and assumptions could result in the recognition of different regulatory liabilities and associated charges in the consolidated financial statements.

service revenues increased due to higher transportation fee revenues at transco and in the eastern gulf reflecting expansion projects placed in-service in 2016 and 2017; partially offset by a decrease in gathering, processing, and fractionation revenue including lower rates, primarily in the barnett shale region associated with the restructuring of
contracts in the fourth quarter of 2016; lower volumes in the western regions, driven by natural declines and extreme weather conditions in the rocky mountains in 2017; and the sale of our former canadian and gulf olefins operations.
product sales increased primarily due to higher marketing revenues reflecting significantly higher prices and volumes. revenues from the sale of our equity ngls increased primarily due to higher non-ethane ngl prices, partially offset by lower volumes. these increases were partially offset by lower olefin production sales due to lower volumes resulting from the sale of our former gulf olefins and canadian operations.
the increase in product costs is primarily due to the same factors that increased marketing sales, partially offset by lower olefin feedstock purchases associated with the sale of our gulf olefins and canadian operations.
operating and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to higher pipeline integrity testing and general maintenance at transco and a settlement charge from a pension early payout program (see note 9 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements), partially offset by the absence of costs associated with our former canadian and gulf olefins operations and lower labor-related costs resulting from our workforce reductions that occurred late in first-quarter 2016, and ongoing cost containment efforts.
selling, general, and administrative expenses (sg&a) decreased primarily due to the absence of certain project development costs associated with the canadian pdh facility that were expensed in 2016, lower labor-related costs resulting from our workforce reductions that occurred late in first-quarter 2016, ongoing cost containment efforts, lower strategic development costs, and the absence of costs associated with our former canadian and gulf coast operations. these decreases were partially offset by higher severance and organizational realignment costs in 2017 (see note 6 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements) and a settlement charge from a pension early payout program.
the unfavorable change in  impairment of certain assets reflects 2017 impairments of certain gathering operations in the mid-continent and marcellus south regions, certain ngl pipeline assets, and an olefins pipeline project in the gulf coast region. these 2017 impairments are partially offset by the absence of 2016 impairments of our former canadian operations and certain mid-continent assets (see note 16 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements).
the gain on sale of geismar interest reflects the gain recognized on the sale of our geismar interest in july 2017. (see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
regulatory charges resulting from tax reform relates to the recognition of regulatory liabilities for the probable return to customers through future rates of the future decrease in income taxes payable associated with tax reform. (see note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements).
the favorable change in other (income) expense - net within operating income (loss) includes the absence of the 2016 loss on the sale of our canadian operations, gains from certain contract settlements and terminations in 2017, a gain on the sale of our rgp splitter in 2017, and the absence of an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange associated with our former canadian operations. these favorable changes are partially offset by additional expense associated with an annual revision to the aro liability, accrual of additional expenses in 2017 related to the geismar incident, as well as the absence of a gain in first-quarter 2016 associated with the sale of unused pipe.
operating income (loss) changed favorably primarily due to the gain on sale of geismar interest, the absence of the 2016 impairments of certain mid-continent assets and our former canadian operations, higher service revenues primarily from expansion projects placed in-service in 2016 and 2017, the absence of expensed canadian pdh facility project development costs in 2016, as well as ongoing cost containment efforts, including workforce reductions in first-quarter 2016. operating income (loss) also improved due to the absence of a 2016 loss on the sale of our canadian operations, the absence of an operating loss associated with our former canadian operations, gains from certain contract settlements and the sale of our rgp splitter. these favorable changes were partially offset by 2017 impairments of
certain gathering operations in the mid-continent and marcellus south regions, regulatory charges resulting from tax reform, and certain ngl pipeline assets, as well as the absence of operating income associated with our former gulf olefins operations, and a settlement charge from a pension early payout program.
the favorable change in equity earnings (losses) is due to an increase in ownership of our appalachia midstream investments and improved results at aux sable due to favorable pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by lower ueom results driven by lower processing volumes from the utica gathering system and lower discovery results due to lower volumes.
the decrease in impairment of equity-method investments reflects the absence of 2016 impairment charges associated with our appalachia midstream investments, dbjv, laurel mountain, and ranch westex equity-method investments. (see note 16 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
other investing income (loss) - net reflects the gain on disposition of our investments in dbjv and ranch westex jv llc in 2017, partially offset by the absence of interest income received in 2016 associated with a receivable related to the sale of certain former venezuelan assets and the absence of a 2016 gain on the sale of an equity-method investment interest in a gathering system that was part of our appalachia midstream investments. (see note 5 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements).
interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest incurred primarily attributable to debt retirements in 2017 and lower borrowings on our credit facilities in 2017. (see note 13 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
other income (expense) - net below operating income (loss) changed unfavorably primarily due to charges reducing regulatory assets related to deferred taxes on equity funds used during construction (afudc) resulting from tax reform and a settlement charge from a pension early payout program, partially offset by a net gain on early debt retirements in 2017, and other favorable changes related to afudc. (see note 5 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
provision (benefit) for income taxes changed favorably primarily due to a reduction in the federal statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent with the enactment of tax reform. the remeasurement of our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities at the reduced rate resulted in the recognition of a net income tax provision benefit of $1.923 billion. adjustments within this provision benefit are considered provisional and are potentially subject to change in the future. see note 7 - provision (benefit) for income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods.
the unfavorable change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to the impact of decreased income allocated to us driven by the permanent waiver of idrs and higher operating results at wpz, partially offset by a decrease in the ownership of the noncontrolling interests. both the permanent waiver of idrs and the change in ownership are associated with the first-quarter 2017 financial repositioning (see note 1 - general, description of business, and basis of presentation of notes to consolidated financial statements). in addition, improved results in our gulfstar operations also contributed to the increase in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by lower results for our cardinal gathering system.
product sales increased primarily due to higher olefin sales reflecting increased volumes at our former geismar plant as a result of the plant operating at higher production levels in 2016, partially offset by a decrease from our other olefin operations associated with lower volumes and per-unit sales prices. product sales also reflect higher marketing revenues associated with higher ngl and propylene prices and natural gas and crude oil volumes, partially offset by lower ngl volumes, and crude oil prices.
the decrease in product costs includes lower olefin feedstock purchases and lower costs associated with other product sales, partially offset by higher marketing purchases primarily due to the same factors that increased marketing sales. the decline in olefin feedstock purchases is primarily associated with lower per-unit feedstock costs and volumes at our other olefin operations, partially offset by an increase in olefin feedstock purchases at our former geismar plant reflecting increased volumes resulting from higher production levels in 2016.
operating and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to lower labor-related and outside service costs resulting from our first-quarter 2016 workforce reductions and cost containment efforts and lower costs associated with general maintenance activities in the marcellus shale, as well as the absence of acmp transition-related costs recognized in 2015. these decreases are partially offset by $16 million of severance and related costs recognized in 2016 and higher pipeline testing and general maintenance costs at transco.
sg&a decreased primarily due to lower merger and transition costs associated with the acmp merger and lower labor-related costs resulting from our first-quarter 2016 workforce reductions and cost containment efforts. these decreases were partially offset by certain project development costs associated with the canadian pdh facility that we began expensing in 2016, as well as $26 million of severance and related costs recognized in 2016 and $17 million of higher costs associated with our evaluation of strategic alternatives.
impairment of goodwill decreased due to the absence of a 2015 impairment charge associated with certain goodwill. (see note 16 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
impairment of certain assets reflects 2016 impairments of our canadian operations and certain mid-continent assets, and other assets. impairments recognized in 2015 relate primarily to previously capitalized development costs and surplus equipment write-downs. (see note 16 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
the unfavorable change in other (income) expense - net within operating income (loss) includes a loss on the sale of our canadian operations that were sold in september 2016, project development costs at constitution as we discontinued capitalization of these costs in april 2016, and an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange that primarily relates to losses incurred on foreign currency transactions and the remeasurement of the u.s. dollar-denominated current assets and liabilities within our former canadian operations, partially offset by a $10 million gain on the sale of idle pipe in 2016.
operating income (loss) changed favorably primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment in 2015, higher olefin margins related to the geismar plant operating at higher production levels in 2016, lower costs related to the merger and integration of acmp, and lower costs and expenses primarily associated with cost containment efforts. these favorable changes are partially offset by impairments and loss on sale of certain assets in 2016, a decrease in insurance proceeds received, expensed canadian pdh facility project development costs, and higher depreciation expenses related to new projects placed in service.
equity earnings (losses) changed favorably primarily due to a $30 million increase at discovery driven by the completion of the keathley canyon connector in the first quarter of 2015. additionally, oppl, laurel mountain, and dbjv improved $16 million, $11 million, and $10 million, respectively.
impairment of equity-method investments reflects 2016 impairment charges associated with our appalachia midstream investments, dbjv, laurel mountain, and ranch westex equity-method investments, while the 2015 impairment charges relate to our equity-method investments in appalachia midstream investments, dbjv, ueom, and laurel mountain. (see note 5 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
other investing income (loss) - net changed favorably due to a 2016 gain on the sale of an equity-method investment interest in a gathering system that was part of our appalachia midstream investments and higher interest income associated with a receivable related to the sale of certain former venezuela assets. (see note 5 - investing activities  of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense increased due to higher interest incurred of $99 million primarily attributable to new debt issuances in 2016 and 2015 and lower interest capitalized of $36 million primarily related to construction projects that have been placed into service, partially offset by lower interest due to 2015 and 2016 debt retirements. (see note 13 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
other income (expense) - net below operating income (loss) changed unfavorably primarily due to a decrease in afudc due to decreased spending on constitution and the absence of a $14 million gain on early debt retirement in 2015.
provision (benefit) for income taxes changed unfavorably primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax loss in 2016. see note 7 - provision (benefit) for income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective tax rates compared to the federal statutory rate for both years.
the unfavorable change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to higher operating results at wpz, the impact of decreased income allocated to the wpz general partner driven by the impact of reduced incentive distributions from wpz, and the absence of the accelerated amortization of a beneficial conversion feature from the first quarter of 2015. these changes are partially offset by a favorable change primarily related to our partners' share of constitution project development costs in 2016.
year-over-year operating results - segments we evaluate segment operating performance based upon modified ebitda. note 18 - segment disclosures of notes to consolidated financial statements includes a reconciliation of this non-gaap measure to net income (loss). management uses modified ebitda because it is an accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare company performance. in addition, management believes that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets. modified ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with gaap.
proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments         795                   754                   699
williams partners modified ebitda                              $3,616                $3,864                $4,003
modified ebitda decreased primarily due to $713 million of regulatory charges associated with the impact of tax reform for transco and northwest pipeline, impairments of certain gathering operations in 2017 and lower olefin margins due to the sale of our gulf olefins operations early in the third quarter of 2017 and $35 million of expense in 2017 related to a settlement charge from a pension early payout program (see note 9 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements).  these decreases are partially offset by the $1.095 billion gain on the sale of our geismar interest in third-quarter 2017, the absence of impairments of our former canadian operations and certain gathering assets in the mid-continent region in 2016, the absence of a loss on the sale of our former canadian operations in third-quarter 2016, higher service revenues, lower segment costs and expenses, and higher proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments.
•   transco's natural gas transportation fee revenues increased $135 million primarily due to a $150 million increase associated with expansion projects placed in-service in 2016 and 2017, partially offset by lower volume-based transportation services revenues;
•   higher eastern gulf coast region revenue of $103 million associated primarily with higher volumes, including the impact of new volumes at gulfstar one related to the gunflint expansion placed in-service in the third quarter of 2016, the absence of the temporary shut-down and subsequent ramp-up of gulfstar one in the second and third quarters of 2016 to tie-in gunflint and the absence of producers' operational issues in the tubular bells field during the first quarter of 2016. this increase is partially offset by lower volumes as a result of a temporary increase in 2016 due to disrupted operations of a competitor;
•   a $39 million increase related to the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the up-front cash payment received in conjunction with the fourth quarter 2016 barnett shale contract restructuring;
•   a $15 million increase in transco's storage revenue primarily reflecting the absence of an accrual for potential refunds associated with a ruling received in certain rate case litigation in 2016;
•   a $79 million decrease in the west region related to net lower gathering rates in the barnett shale area primarily due to the fourth quarter 2016 contract restructuring, along with lower rates recognized in the niobrara, eagle ford shale, and haynesville shale regions. these rate decreases are offset by higher commodity-based fee revenues in the piceance area primarily due to higher per-unit ngl margins and higher rates in the wamsutter area as a result of renegotiated rates in conjunction with infrastructure expansions. rates recognized in the niobrara region represent a portion of the total contractual rate that is received, with the difference reflected as deferred revenue;
•   a $34 million decrease driven by lower volumes in the west region primarily as a result of natural declines and more extreme weather conditions in the rocky mountains in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher volumes in the haynesville shale region as a result of increased drilling in certain areas;
•   a $15 million decrease in western gulf coast region fee revenues due to lower volumes primarily associated with producer maintenance.
•   a $32 million increase in revenues from our equity ngls including a $102 million increase driven primarily by higher non-ethane prices, partially offset by a $36 million decrease due to the absence of ngl production revenues associated with our former canadian operations and a $34 million decrease primarily related to lower non-ethane volumes at our domestic plants driven by the absence of temporary volumes in 2016 related to disrupted operations of a competitor, severe winter conditions in the first quarter of 2017, and natural declines;
•   a $12 million increase in system management gas sales from transco. system management gas sales are offset in product costs and, therefore, have no impact on modified ebitda;
•   a $380 million decrease in olefin sales primarily due to a $343 million decrease reflecting the absence of third- and fourth-quarter sales of our gulf olefins operations, a $29 million decrease due to the sale of the canadian operations in 2016, and a $16 million decrease at our geismar plant in the first half of 2017 primarily due to lower volumes associated with the electrical outage in second-quarter 2017, as well as planned maintenance downtime in first-quarter 2017. these items were partially offset by $8 million higher sales at the rgp splitter in the first half 2017 primarily due to higher propylene prices.
•   a $725 million increase in marketing purchases primarily due to the same factors that increased marketing sales (more than offset in marketing revenues). the increase in marketing costs does not reflect the intercompany costs associated with certain gathering and processing services performed by an affiliate;
•   a $166 million decrease in olefin feedstock purchases primarily due to the absence of $163 million in feedstock purchases in the second half of 2017 reflecting the sale of the gulf olefins operations, as well as the absence of $9 million in costs associated with our former canadian operations, partially offset by $6 million higher feedstock costs in the first half of 2017.
•   a $2 million decrease in costs from our equity ngls including a $35 million increase driven primarily by higher gas prices, partially offset by a $24 million decrease due to the absence of ngl production revenues associated with our former canadian operations and a $13 million decrease primarily related to lower volumes at our domestic plants driven by severe winter conditions in the first quarter of 2017, and the absence of temporary volumes in 2016 related to disrupted operations of a competitor and natural declines.
the favorable change in other segment costs and expenses includes a decrease in labor-related expenses primarily due to our first quarter 2016 workforce reduction and ongoing cost containment efforts; the absence of $117 million of operating and other expenses associated with our gulf olefins and canadian operations; and the absence of a $34 million loss on the sale of our former canadian operations. additional favorable changes in other segment costs and expenses include a $27 million net gain associated with early debt retirement; a $15 million gain related to favorable contract settlements and terminations; a favorable change in equity afudc, primarily associated with an increase in transco's capital spending, which is partially offset by a decrease in capital spending at constitution; and a $12 million gain on the sale of the rgp splitter. these decreases are partially offset by $35 million of expense in 2017 related to a settlement charge from a pension early payout program (see note 9 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements), higher various maintenance expenses, an increase in pipeline integrity testing on transco, and higher geismar selling expenses and repairs related to a geismar electrical outage.
gain on sale of geismar interest reflects the gain recognized on the sale of our geismar interest in july 2017. (see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
impairment of certain assets increased primarily due to a $1.032 billion impairment of certain gathering operations primarily in the mid-continent region and a $115 million impairment of certain gathering operations in the marcellus south region, partially offset by the absence of a $341 million impairment of our former canadian operations and a $100 million impairment of certain mid-continent gathering assets and impairments or write-downs of other certain assets that may no longer be in use or are surplus in nature during 2016. (see note 16 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
regulatory charges resulting from tax reform reflects $713 million of regulatory charges associated with the impact of tax reform at transco and northwest pipeline with $674 million presented as regulatory charges resulting from tax reform and $39 million included within other income (expense) - net below operating income (loss) in the consolidated statement of operations.
the increase in proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments includes a $100 million increase at appalachia midstream investments reflecting our increased ownership acquired late in the first quarter of 2017, higher gathering volumes reflecting the absence of shut-in volumes from 2016 and increased customer production, and a $20 million increase at aux sable due to increased customer production. these increases are partially offset by a $34 million decrease at ueom reflecting lower processing volumes from the wet gas areas of the utica gathering system, the divestiture of our interests in dbjv and ranch westex jv llc late in the first quarter of 2017, a $12 million decrease from discovery primarily attributable to lower fee revenue driven by production issues at certain wells and higher turbine maintenance expenses.
modified ebitda decreased primarily due to higher impairments, lower insurance recoveries associated with the geismar incident, and loss on sale associated with our canadian operations. these decreases were partially offset by higher olefin margins related to the geismar plant operating at higher production levels in 2016, lower segment costs and expenses, and higher earnings related to our equity-method investments, including the completion of the keathley canyon connector at discovery in the first quarter of 2015. additionally, higher marketing margins, higher service revenues related to projects placed in service, and higher ngl margins improved modified ebitda.
the increase in service revenues is primarily due to a $79 million increase in transco's natural gas transportation fee revenues primarily associated with expansion projects placed in service in 2015 and 2016 and a $31 million transportation and fractionation revenue increase associated with williams' horizon liquids extraction plant in canada. the canadian operations were sold in late september 2016. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in gathering, processing, and fractionation revenue primarily due to lower volumes primarily in the barnett shale and anadarko basin and a $15 million decrease in transco's storage revenue related to potential refunds associated with a ruling received in certain rate case litigation in 2016.
•   a $94 million increase in olefin sales comprised of a $170 million increase from the geismar plant that returned to service in late march 2015, partially offset by a $76 million decrease from our other former olefin operations. the increase at geismar includes $153 million associated with increased volumes as a result of the plant operating at higher production levels in 2016 than when production resumed in march 2015 following the geismar incident and $17 million primarily associated with higher ethylene per-unit sales prices. the decrease in other olefin sales includes a $14 million reduction due to the absence of our former canadian operations in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as lower volumes and lower per-unit sales prices within our other olefin operations;
•   a $6 million increase in revenues from our equity ngls due to a $10 million increase associated with higher volumes, partially offset by a $4 million decrease associated with lower ngl prices;
•   a $39 million decrease in system management gas sales from transco. system management gas sales are offset in product costs and, therefore, have no impact on modified ebitda.
•   a $17 million decrease in olefin feedstock purchases is primarily comprised of $78 million in lower purchases at our former other olefins operations, partially offset by $61 million of higher purchases due primarily to increased volumes at the geismar plant resulting from higher productions levels. the lower costs at our former other olefin operations are comprised of $54 million in lower per-unit feedstock costs and $24 million in primarily lower propylene volumes;
•   a $4 million decrease in natural gas purchases associated with the production of equity ngls reflecting a decrease of $13 million due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by a $9 million increase associated with higher volumes;
•   lower costs associated with various other products, primarily condensate;
•   a $22 million increase in marketing purchases primarily due to the same factors that increased marketing sales (more than offset in marketing revenues). the increase in marketing costs does not reflect the intercompany costs associated with certain gathering and processing services performed by an affiliate.
the decrease in other segment costs and expenses is primarily due to lower operating costs and general and administrative expenses reflecting decreases in primarily labor-related and outside services costs resulting from our first-quarter 2016 workforce reductions and ongoing cost containment efforts and lower costs associated with general maintenance activities in the marcellus shale, as well as $43 million of lower acmp merger and transition-related expenses. other items partially offsetting these decreases are as follows:
•   $37 million increase for severance and related costs associated with workforce reductions incurred in the first quarter of 2016 and the organizational realignment in the fourth quarter of 2016;
•   $28 million higher project development costs at constitution as we discontinued capitalization of development costs related to this project beginning in april 2016;
•   $20 million unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange that primarily relates to losses incurred on foreign currency transactions and the remeasurement of the u.s. dollar-denominated current assets and liabilities within our former canadian operations;
•   $19 million unfavorable change in afudc associated with a decrease in spending on constitution;
impairment of certain assets increased primarily due to 2016 impairments of $341 million associated with our canadian operations and $63 million associated with certain mid-continent gathering assets as well as impairments or write-downs of other certain assets that may no longer be in use or are surplus in nature, partially offset by the absence of 2015 impairments of $94 million associated with previously capitalized project development costs for a gas processing plant and $20 million associated with certain surplus equipment within our ohio valley midstream business. (see note 16 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
the increase in proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments is primarily due to a $30 million increase from discovery primarily associated with higher fee revenues attributable to the completion of the keathley canyon connector in the first quarter of 2015. additionally, caiman ii contributed a $20 million increase resulting from higher volumes due to assets placed into service in 2015, oppl contributed a $16 million increase primarily due to higher transportation volumes and lower expenses, and ueom contributed an $11 million increase primarily associated with an increase in our ownership percentage. these increases were partially offset by a $29 million decrease from appalachia midstream investments primarily due to lower fee revenues driven by lower rates, partially offset by lower impairments and higher volumes.
other modified ebitda   $(150     )         $(542     )         $(112     )
the favorable change in modified ebitda is primarily due to:
•   the absence of the $406 million 2016 impairment of our canadian operations, partially offset by the $23 million impairment of an olefins pipeline project in the gulf coast region in the second quarter of 2017 and the $68 million impairment of a certain ngl pipeline asset in the third quarter of 2017 (see note 16 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements);
•   the absence of $61 million of certain project development costs associated with the canadian pdh facility that we expensed in 2016;
•   the absence of $32 million of transportation and fractionation fees incurred in 2016 related to the redwater fractionation facility, which was included in the sale of our canadian operations in september 2016;
•   a $29 million increase in income associated with an increase in a regulatory asset primarily driven by our increased ownership in wpz.
•   a $35 million settlement charge expense related to the program to pay out certain deferred vested pension benefits of employees associated with former operations. (see note 9 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements);
•   a reduction in revenues associated with an ngl pipeline near the houston ship channel region;
the unfavorable change in modified ebitda is primarily due to:
•   an increase of $61 million of certain project development costs associated with the canadian pdh facility that we began expensing in 2016;
•   a $31 million decrease in acmp merger and transition related costs;
•   the absence of a $64 million write-off of previously capitalized project development costs for an olefins pipeline project in 2015.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and liquidity overview in 2017, we exceeded our target for asset sales, significantly improved our balance sheet to provide ample available liquidity, and continued to focus on growth in our businesses by identifying, contracting, permitting, and constructing attractive expansion projects. examples of this activity included:
•   sale of our geismar interest (see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures of notes to consolidated financial statements).
•   repayment of wpz's $1.4 billion of 4.875 percent senior unsecured notes that were due in 2023 with proceeds from the issuance of wpz's $1.45 billion of 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes due in 2027;
•   extension to 2021 for the maturity dates of our long-term credit facility and wpz's long-term credit facility;
outlook fee-based businesses are a significant component of our portfolio and serve to reduce the influence of commodity price fluctuations on our cash flows. we expect to benefit as continued growth in demand for low-cost natural gas is driven by increases in lng exports, industrial demand, and power generation.
as previously discussed in company outlook, our consolidated growth capital and investment expenditures in 2018 are expected to be approximately $2.7 billion. approximately $1.7 billion of our growth capital funding needs include transco expansions and other interstate pipeline growth projects, most of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements. the remaining growth capital spending in 2018 primarily reflects investment in gathering and processing systems in the northeast region limited primarily to known new producer volumes, including volumes that support transco expansion projects including our atlantic sunrise project. in addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments. wpz intends to fund their planned 2018 growth capital with retained cash flow and debt. we retain the flexibility to adjust planned levels of growth capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in economic conditions or business opportunities.
liquidity based on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage our businesses in 2018. wpz expects to be self-funding and maintain separate bank accounts and credit facilities, including its commercial paper program. our potential material internal and external sources and uses of consolidated liquidity for 2018 are as follows:
distributions from equity-method investees                         ü
utilization of credit facilities and/or commercial paper program   ü             ü
cash proceeds from issuance of debt and/or equity securities       ü             ü
working capital requirements                                       ü             ü
capital and investment expenditures                                ü
quarterly distributions to unitholders                             ü
potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity discussed above include those previously discussed in company outlook.
as of december 31, 2017, we had a working capital deficit of $467 million. our available liquidity is as follows:
available liquidity                                                                                                                            wpz                 wmb                         total

(1)   the highest amount outstanding under our credit facility during 2017 was $805 million. at december 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the financial covenants associated with this credit facility. see note 13 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our credit facility. borrowing capacity available under this facility as of february 20, 2018, was $1.5 billion.
(2)   in managing our available liquidity, we do not expect a maximum outstanding amount in excess of the capacity of wpz's credit facility inclusive of any outstanding amounts under its commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2017, no commercial paper was outstanding under wpz's commercial paper program. the highest amount outstanding under wpz's commercial paper program and credit facility during 2017 was $178 million. at december 31, 2017, wpz was in compliance with the financial covenants associated with this credit facility. see note 13 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on wpz's credit facility and wpz's commercial paper program. borrowing capacity available under wpz's $3.5 billion credit facility as of february 20, 2018, was $3.5 billion.
as described in note 13 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements, we have determined that we have net assets that are technically considered restricted in accordance with rule 4-08(e) of regulation s-x of the securities and exchange commission in excess of 25 percent of our consolidated net assets. we do not expect this determination will impact our ability to pay dividends or meet future obligations as the terms of wpz's partnership agreement require it to make quarterly distributions of all available cash, as defined, to its unitholders.
dividends as part of the financial repositioning, we increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by 50 percent from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share paid in december 2016, to $0.30 per share for the dividends paid in each quarter of 2017.
registrations in september 2016, wpz filed a registration statement for its distribution reinvestment program.
in february 2015, wpz filed a shelf registration statement, as a well-known seasoned issuer, registering common units representing limited partner interests and debt securities. also in february 2015, wpz filed a shelf registration statement for the offer and sale from time to time of common units representing limited partner interests in wpz having an aggregate offering price of up to $1 billion. these sales are to be made over a period of time and from time to time in transactions at prices which are market prices prevailing at the time of sale, prices related to market price, or at negotiated prices. such sales are to be made pursuant to an equity distribution agreement between wpz and certain banks who may act as sales agents or purchase for their own accounts as principals. during 2016 and 2015, wpz received net proceeds of approximately $115 million and approximately $59 million, respectively, from equity issued under this registration; there was no activity during 2017.
distributions from equity-method investees the organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis. in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses. (see note 5 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for our more significant equity-method investees.)
credit ratings our ability to borrow money is impacted by our credit ratings and the credit ratings of wpz. the current ratings are as follows:

operating activities the factors that determine operating activities are largely the same as those that affect net income (loss), with the exception of noncash items such as depreciation and amortization, provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes, net (gain) loss on disposition of equity-method investments, impairment of goodwill, impairment of equity-method investments, impairment of and net (gain) loss on sale of assets and businesses, gain on sale of geismar interest, and regulatory charges resulting from tax reform.
our net cash provided (used) by operating activities in 2017 decreased from 2016 primarily due to the absence in 2017 of receipts from 2016 contract restructurings, partially offset by higher operating income in 2017.
our net cash provided (used) by operating activities in 2016 increased from 2015 primarily due to the impact of net favorable changes in operating working capital and receipts from contract restructurings.
off-balance sheet arrangements and guarantees of debt or other commitments we have various other guarantees and commitments which are disclosed in note 3 - variable interest entities, note 10 - property, plant, and equipment, note 13 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases, note 16 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk, and note 17 - contingent liabilities and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements. we do not believe these guarantees and commitments or the possible fulfillment of them will prevent us from meeting our liquidity needs.
contractual obligations the table below summarizes the maturity dates of our contractual obligations at december 31, 2017:
(1)   includes the borrowings outstanding under credit facilities, but does not include any related variable-rate interest payments.
(2)   includes approximately $348 million in open property, plant, and equipment purchase orders. includes an estimated $314 million long-term ethane purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that is reflected in this table at december 31, 2017 prices. this obligation is part of an overall exchange agreement whereby volumes we transport on oppl are sold at a third-party fractionator near conway, kansas, and we are subsequently obligated to purchase ethane volumes at mont belvieu. the purchased ethane volumes may be utilized or sold at comparable prices in the mont belvieu market. includes an estimated $454 million long-term ethane purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that primarily supplies third parties at their plants and is valued in this table at a price calculated using december 31, 2017 prices. any excess purchased volumes may be sold at comparable market prices. includes an estimated $765 million long-term mixed ngls purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that is reflected in this table at december 31, 2017 prices. includes an estimated $278 million long-term ethane purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that primarily supplies a third party for consumption at their plant and is reflected in this table at a price calculated using december 31, 2017 prices. any excess purchased volumes may be sold at comparable market prices. in addition, we have not included certain natural gas life-of-lease contracts for which the future volumes are indeterminable. we have not included commitments, beyond purchase orders, for the acquisition or construction of property, plant, and equipment or expected contributions to our jointly owned investments. (see company outlook - expansion projects.)
(3)   does not include estimated contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $90 million in 2017 and $72 million in 2016. in 2018, we expect to contribute approximately $91 million to these plans (see note 9 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements). tax-qualified pension plans are required to meet minimum contribution requirements. in the past, we have contributed amounts to our tax-qualified pension plans in excess of the minimum required contribution. these excess amounts can be used to offset future minimum contribution requirements. during 2017, we contributed $80 million to our tax-qualified pension plans. in addition to these contributions, a portion of the excess contributions was used to meet the minimum contribution requirements. during 2018, we expect to contribute approximately $80 million to our tax-qualified pension plans and use excess amounts to satisfy minimum contribution requirements, if needed. additionally, estimated future minimum funding requirements may vary significantly from historical requirements if actual results differ significantly from estimated results for assumptions such as returns on plan assets, interest rates, retirement rates, mortality, and other significant assumptions or by changes to current legislation and regulations.
(4)   we have not included income tax liabilities in the table above. see note 7 - provision (benefit) for income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes, including our contingent tax liability reserves.
effects of inflation our operations have historically not been materially affected by inflation. approximately 43 percent of our gross property, plant, and equipment is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipeline assets. they are subject to regulation, which limits recovery to historical cost. while amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under current ferc practices, we anticipate being allowed to recover and earn a return based on increased actual cost incurred to replace existing assets. cost-based regulations, along with competition and other market factors, may limit our ability to recover such increased costs. for our gathering and processing assets, operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by both competition for specialized services and specific price changes in crude oil and natural gas and related commodities than by changes in general inflation. crude oil, natural gas, and ngl prices are particularly sensitive to the market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in the near future, as well as general economic conditions. however, our exposure to certain of these price changes is reduced through the fee-based nature of certain of our services and the use of hedging instruments.
environmental we are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations, and/or remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently do not own (see note 17 - contingent liabilities and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements). we are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties, the epa, or other governmental authorities. we are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others. current estimates of the most likely costs of such activities are approximately $38 million, all of which are included in accrued liabilities and regulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2017. we will seek recovery of the accrued costs related to remediation activities by our interstate gas pipelines totaling approximately $7 million through future natural gas transmission rates. the remainder of these costs will be funded from operations. during 2017, we paid approximately $6 million for cleanup and/or remediation and monitoring activities. we expect to pay approximately $10 million in 2018 for these activities. estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar cleanup operations. at december 31, 2017, certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield different estimates of most likely costs. therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the epa or other governmental authorities, and other factors.
the epa and various state regulatory agencies routinely promulgate and propose new rules, and issue updated guidance to existing rules. more recent rules and rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine maximum achievable control technology, air quality standards for one hour nitrogen dioxide emissions, and volatile organic compound and methane new source performance standards impacting design and operation of storage vessels, pressure valves, and compressors. on october 1, 2015, the epa issued its rule regarding national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone, setting a stricter standard of 70 parts per billion. we are monitoring the rule's implementation as the reduction will trigger additional federal and state regulatory actions that may impact our operations. implementation of the regulations is expected to result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to property, plant, and equipment - net in the consolidated balance sheet for both new and existing facilities in affected areas. we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost of additions that may be required to meet the regulations at this time due to uncertainty created by various legal challenges to these regulations and the need for further specific regulatory guidance.
our interstate natural gas pipelines consider prudently incurred environmental assessment and remediation costs and the costs associated with compliance with environmental standards to be recoverable through rates.

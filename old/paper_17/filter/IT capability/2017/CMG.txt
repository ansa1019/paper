risk factors," as well as note 10. "commitments and contingencies" in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data," for further discussion of the payment card security incident and related legal proceedings.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded a liability of $30.0 million ($18.2 million after tax), or $0.64 per basic and diluted earnings per share, as an estimate of potential losses associated with anticipated claims and assessments by payment card networks.  we may ultimately be subject to liabilities greater or less than the amount accrued.
restaurant openings, relocations and closures the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated.
the significant factors contributing to the increase in revenue in 2017 were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed $338.8 million to the revenue increase, of which $149.1 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2017, and comparable restaurant sales increased $233.2 million. the increase in comparable restaurant sales was attributable to an increase in average check, including a 1.2% benefit from menu price increases.
food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 primarily due to the benefit of the menu price increases taken in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarters of 2017. food, beverage and packaging costs also benefitted from bringing the preparation of lettuce and bell peppers back into our restaurants after using pre-cut produce during portions of 2016, and cost savings initiatives resulting in lower prices and usage of paper and packaging products. these decreases were partially offset by higher avocado prices. we expect food, beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue in 2018 to be lower than 2017 due to the benefit of menu price increases, and our expectations for stable commodity prices.
labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased during the year ended december 31, 2017 due primarily to increased crew efficiency, including the benefit of lower promotional activity during the year, improved manager deployment, and sales leverage, including the impact of menu price increases.  the decrease was partially offset by wage inflation.   we expect labor costs as a percentage of revenue to be higher in 2018 than 2017 due to labor inflation and the enhanced benefits described above under "overview - tax law changes."
occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to lower average restaurant sales on a largely fixed-cost base. occupancy costs increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to costs associated with new restaurants.
other operating costs include, among other items, marketing and promotional costs, bank and credit card fees, and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs. other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 due primarily to decreased marketing and promotional spend, sales leverage including the benefit of menu price increases, and decreased kitchen supplies expense. marketing and promotional spend decreased to 3.5% of revenue in 2017, as compared to 5.1% of revenue in 2016.  we expect other operating costs as a percentage of revenue in 2018 to remain consistent with 2017 as planned lower marketing and promotional spend is offset by expected higher maintenance costs from investments in our existing restaurants.
general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms in 2017, due to recording a liability of $30.0 million as an estimate of potential losses associated with anticipated claims and assessments by payment card networks for the data security incident that occurred in 2017. increased bonus costs and higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense also contributed to the increase. the increase was partially offset by lower legal costs, and decreased meeting costs because of the biennial all managers conference held in september 2016. the increase in stock-based compensation expense during 2017 was primarily a result of a cumulative reduction of expense in 2016 for performance share awards that were no longer expected to vest.  we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms in 2018 due to increased wages and benefits, the biennial all managers' conference planned for the third quarter of 2018, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense.
the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms for 2016 primarily resulted from increased legal expense, higher payroll costs as we grew, and expenses associated with our biennial all managers' conference held during 2016, partially offset by lower bonus expense and travel costs.
depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 due to sales deleveraging. the increase in dollar terms was due primarily to depreciation and amortization costs associated with new restaurants.
loss on disposal and impairment of assets during the year ended december 31, 2017 consisted primarily of charges related to the closure of underperforming chipotle restaurants and the replacement of certain kitchen equipment.
loss on disposal and impairment of assets increased in 2016 primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge of $14.5 million to write-down substantially all of the value of the long-lived assets of our 15 shophouse restaurants.
the 2017 annual effective tax rate was lower than the 2016 rate due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, resulting in our recording a benefit for the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability, as well as from a lower state tax rate. the decrease in our effective tax rate was partially offset by federal credits on overall higher pre-tax operating income.
the 2016 effective tax rate was higher than 2015 due to a higher state tax rate, not qualifying for the federal research and development tax credit in 2016 whereas we did qualify for the credit in 2015, and other federal credits on overall lower pre-tax operating income.
quarterly financial data/seasonality the following table presents data from the consolidated statement of income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31, 2017. the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter.
seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. historically our average daily restaurant sales are lower, and net income has generally been lower, in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. for example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. seasonal factors, however, might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results, such as unexpected publicity impacting our business in a positive or negative way, as well as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases. the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results, although on an overall annual basis, changes in trading days do not have a significant impact.
our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter, the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and anticipated and unanticipated events. new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, initiatives to improve the guest experience in our restaurants, working capital, and general corporate needs. as of december 31, 2017, we had a cash and short-term investment balance of $509.0 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business, to invest in, maintain and refurbish our existing restaurants, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions, and for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2017, there was $118.3 million remaining available under repurchase authorizations previously approved by our board of directors. under the remaining repurchase authorizations, shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, subject to market conditions. we believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and investment balances, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.
we haven't required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. in addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth.
our total capital expenditures for 2017 were $216.8 million. in 2017, we spent on average about $835,000 in development and construction costs per new restaurant, or about $735,000 net of landlord reimbursements of $100,000.  in 2018, we expect to incur about $300 million in total capital expenditures.  we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to consist of investments in existing restaurants, including remodeling and similar improvements, and upgrading our second make lines and other restaurant equipment.  we also expect about $120 million in capital expenditures related to our construction of new restaurants, before any reductions for landlord reimbursements.  for new restaurants to be opened in 2018, we anticipate average development costs will increase due to initiatives planned in most of our new restaurants such as the addition of the upgraded second make line.  finally, we expect a portion of our capital expenditures for the year to be incurred for additional corporate initiatives.
(1)   see note 8. "leases" of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data."
(2)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms. we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. the majority of our purchase
obligations relate to amounts owed for chicken, produce, and other ingredients and supplies, construction contractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction and planned remodels, and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships.
the above table does not include income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. additionally, we have excluded our estimated loss contingencies related to the data security incident described elsewhere, due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of payment. see note 10. "commitments and contingencies" of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data."
inflation the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, healthcare costs, fuel, utility costs, and materials used in the construction of our restaurants. although a significant majority of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level. additionally, many of our leases require us to pay property taxes, maintenance, and utilities, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases. there have been, and there may be in the future, delays in implementing such menu price increases. if we do raise menu prices in the future, general competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation.
critical accounting estimates we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1. "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data." critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. we believe that of our critical accounting estimates, the following involve a higher degree of judgement and subjectivity.    leases we lease nearly all of our restaurant locations. our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. we have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years.  we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term. the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term.  if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed, our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially.
stock-based compensation we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award's fair value. we use the black-scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock-only stock appreciation rights, or sosars, and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions. both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility, and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data. similarly, the compensation expense of performance share awards, and sosars with performance-based vesting conditions, is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars. we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance. those estimates are based on a number of assumptions, and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards. had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars, or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different. certain awards that contain service, performance and market conditions have vesting criteria based on chipotle's relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in annual average revenue growth,
net income growth, and total shareholder return. our estimates of chipotle's future performance and the future performance of the restaurant industry peer group are assumptions that involve a high degree of subjectivity. if we had arrived at different assumptions for revenue growth or net income for chipotle or the peer group, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different.     insurance liability we are self-insured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers' compensation, general liability, employee health, property and auto damage, but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. our history of claims experience is relatively short and our significant growth during most of our operating history could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated, or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31, 2017 were $52.0 million.
reserves/contingencies for litigation and other matters we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. these actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. consequently, we were unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31, 2017. although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions, our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate, and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability.  as a result, in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved, such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows.
item  7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price risks we are exposed to commodity price risks. many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials and utilities to run our restaurants, are ingredients or commodities that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices, and range forward protocols under which we agree on a price range for the duration of that protocol. however, a majority of the dollar value of our purchases is effectively at spot prices. generally, our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 24 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. in several cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. we've tried to increase, where practical, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase, or if menu price increases result in customer resistance.
changing interest rates we are also exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments. changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. as of december 31, 2017, we had $362.1 million in investments and interest-bearing cash accounts, including insurance-related restricted trust accounts classified in other assets, and $129.3 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income, which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 0.97%.
foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the u.s. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the u.s. dollar. however, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the u.s., and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date.

opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of chipotle mexican grill, inc. (the company), as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). in our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the company at december 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2017, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united stated) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2017, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) and our report dated february 8, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
/s/ ernst & young llp we have served as the company's auditor since 1997.

1. description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in this annual report on form 10-k, chipotle mexican grill, inc., a delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is collectively referred to as "chipotle," "we," "us," or "our."
we develop and operate restaurants that serve a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, and salads, made using fresh, high-quality ingredients. as of december 31, 2017, we operated 2,363 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states as well as 37 international chipotle restaurants and eight non-chipotle restaurants. we transitioned the management of our operations from 11 to nine regions during 2017 and have aggregated our operations to one reportable segment.
principles of consolidation and basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements include our accounts, including wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue, net of discounts and incentives, when payment is tendered at the point of sale. we recognize a liability for offers of free food by estimating the cost to satisfy the offer based on company-specific historical redemption patterns for similar promotions. these costs are recognized in other operating costs in the consolidated statement of income and in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. we report revenue net of sales-related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental taxing authorities.
we sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date and we do not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. we recognize revenue from gift cards when: (i) the gift card is redeemed by the customer; or (ii) we determine the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote (gift card breakage) and there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction. the determination of the gift card breakage rate is based upon company-specific historical redemption patterns. we have determined that 4% of gift card sales will not be redeemed and will be retained. gift card breakage is recognized in revenue as the gift cards are used on a pro rata basis.  during the quarter ended december 31, 2017, we revised the period over which we recognize gift card breakage from six months to eight months from the date of the gift card sale in the consolidated statement of income. breakage recognized during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $3,590, $3,624 and $4,226, respectively.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we offered a limited-time frequency program that awarded free food or merchandise to customers based on frequency of monthly visits. we deferred revenue reflecting the portion of original sales allocated to the rewards that were earned by program participants and not redeemed at the end of the year, and recorded a corresponding liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. the portion of revenue allocated to the rewards was based on the estimated value of the award earned and takes into consideration company-specific historical redemption patterns for similar promotions. rewards expire according to the loyalty awards terms and conditions. deferred revenue related to the frequency program was $0 and $5,489 as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively, and the entire amount that was deferred as of december 31, 2016 was recognized during 2017.
cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investment instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. we have not experienced any losses related to these balances and believe the risk to be minimal.
accounts receivable accounts receivable primarily consists of receivables from third party gift card distributors, tenant improvement receivables, vendor rebates, and interest receivable. the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable based on a specific review of account balances. account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recoverability is considered remote.
investments investments classified as trading securities are carried at fair value with any unrealized gain or loss being recorded in the consolidated statement of income. investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) on the statement of comprehensive income. held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. impairment charges on investments are recognized in interest and other income, net on the consolidated statement of income when management believes the decline in the fair value of the investment is other-than-temporary.
leasehold improvements, property and equipment leasehold improvements, property and equipment are recorded at cost. internal costs directly associated with the acquisition, development and construction of a restaurant are capitalized and were $7,507, $8,076 and $9,554 for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized while expenditures for minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term, which generally includes reasonably assured option periods, or the estimated useful lives of the assets. upon retirement or disposal of assets, the accounts are relieved of cost and accumulated depreciation and any related gain or loss is reflected in loss on disposal and impairment of assets in the consolidated statement of income.
leasehold improvements and buildings   3-20 years furniture and fixtures                  4-7 years equipment                              3-10 years goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of the business acquired. goodwill is not subject to amortization, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually, and we are required to record any necessary impairment adjustments. impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the goodwill. based on our analysis, no impairment charges were recognized on goodwill for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
other assets other assets consist primarily of restricted cash assets of $29,601 and $28,490 as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a rabbi trust as described further in note 7. "employee benefit plans," transferable liquor licenses which are carried at the lower of fair value or cost, and rental deposits related to leased properties. restricted cash assets are primarily insurance-related restricted trust assets.
impairment of long-lived assets long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. for the purpose of reviewing restaurant assets to be held and used for potential impairment, assets are grouped together at the market level, or in the case of a potential relocation or closure, at the restaurant level. we manage our restaurants as a group with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, an aggregate impairment charge of $3,291, $17,394 and $6,675, respectively, was recognized in loss on disposal and impairment of assets in the consolidated statement of income. during the year ended december 31, 2017, the impairment charges resulted primarily from the closure of a small number of underperforming chipotle restaurants. impairment charges recognized during the year ended december 31, 2016 resulted primarily from the impairment of shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants which were closed during 2017. during the year ended december 31, 2015, the impairment charges resulted from an internally developed software program we chose not to implement and the related hardware, the discontinued use of certain kitchen equipment from our restaurants, as well as restaurant relocations. the fair value of restaurants was determined using level 3 inputs (unobservable inputs) based on a discounted cash flows method. see "fair value measurements" below for a description of level inputs.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment. the deferred income tax impacts of investment tax credits are recognized as an immediate adjustment to income tax expense. when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future, we provide a corresponding valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset, except for deferred tax assets related to stock awards when there is sufficient future taxable income to recover the deferred tax assets. when it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained upon examination by a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, we measure the amount of tax benefit from our position and record the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized after settlement with a tax authority. our policy is to recognize interest to be paid on an underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and any related statutory penalties in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of income.
restaurant pre-opening costs pre-opening costs, including rent, wages, benefits and travel for training and opening teams, food and other restaurant operating costs, are expensed as incurred prior to a restaurant opening for business, and are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of income.
insurance liability we are self-insured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers' compensation, employee health, general liability, automobile, and property damage. pursuant to these policies, we are responsible for losses up to varying deductibles and are required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits. this liability is based on our estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and, where applicable, claims not reported as of the balance sheet date. the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions, and economic conditions. if actual trends differ from the estimates, the financial results could be impacted. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, $37,096 and $35,550, respectively, of the estimated liability was included in accrued payroll and benefits and $14,014 and $13,881, respectively, was included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
additionally, certain operating leases contain clauses that provide additional contingent rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts. contingent rent expense is recognized provided the achievement of that target is considered probable.
stock-based compensation we issue shares as part of employee compensation pursuant to the amended and restated chipotle mexican grill, inc. 2011 stock incentive plan (the "2011 incentive plan"). stock only stock appreciation rights ("sosars") and stock awards generally vest equally over two and three years and expire after seven years.  stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis for each separate vesting portion. compensation expense related to employees eligible to retire and retain full rights to the awards is recognized over six months which coincides with the notice period. we estimate forfeitures based on historical data when determining the amount of stock-based compensation costs to be recognized in each period. we have also granted sosars and stock awards with performance vesting conditions and/or market vesting conditions. stock awards with performance or market vesting conditions generally vest based on our achievement versus stated targets or criteria over a three-year performance and service period.  compensation expense on sosars subject to performance conditions is recognized over the longer of the estimated performance goal attainment period or time vesting period. compensation expense on stock awards subject to performance conditions, which is based on the quantity of awards we have determined are probable of vesting, is recognized over the longer of the estimated performance goal attainment period or time vesting period. compensation expense is recognized ratably for awards subject to market conditions regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. some stock-based compensation awards are made to employees involved in our new restaurant development activities, and expense for these awards is recognized as capitalized development and included in leasehold improvements, property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet.
fair value measurements fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. for assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following:
level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.
level 2: observable inputs other than prices included in level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.
level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. this includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
foreign currency translation our international operations use the local currency as the functional currency. assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
recently issued accounting standards in november 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2016-18, "statement of cash flows (topic 230)", which provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts on the statement of cash flows. we will be adopting this pronouncement on january 1, 2018, using a retrospective adoption method. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, $29,601, $28,490 and $22,572, respectively, of restricted cash would have been included in cash and cash equivalents and changes in the balance excluded from net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows if this new guidance had been adopted as of the respective dates.
in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, "leases (topic 842)." the pronouncement requires lessees to recognize a liability for lease obligations, which represent the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet. the guidance requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements which are intended to give financial statement users the ability to assess the amount, timing, and potential uncertainty of cash flows related to leases. we expect to adopt the requirements of the new lease standard effective january 1, 2019. we are currently evaluating the provisions of the new lease standard, including optional practical expedients, and assessing our existing lease portfolio in order to determine the impact to our accounting systems, processes and internal control over financial reporting. the adoption of asu 2016-02 will have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet because we will record material assets and obligations for current operating leases. we are still assessing the expected impact on our consolidated statements of income and cash flows.    in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)," as amended by multiple standards updates. this guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. additionally, this guidance will require us to enhance our disclosures, including disclosing performance obligations to customers arising from gift cards and certain promotional activity. the pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017. the adoption is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.      we reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they were either not applicable or not expected to have a significant impact to the consolidated financial statements.
recently adopted accounting standard in march 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-09, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718)." the pronouncement was issued to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the consolidated statement of cash flows.    we adopted asu 2016-09 on january 1, 2017, prospectively (prior periods have not been restated).  the primary impact of adoption was the recognition for the year ended december 31, 2017, of an excess tax benefit of $448, which reduces our provision for income taxes and the classification of these excess tax benefits in operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows instead of financing activities.
the presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows, since such cash flows have historically been presented in financing activities. we also elected to continue estimating forfeitures when determining the amount of stock-based compensation costs to be recognized in each period. no other provisions of asu 2016-09 had a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures.        2. supplemental financial information leasehold improvements, property and equipment were as follows:
furniture and fixtures                                          166,915                  157,541
accrued payroll and benefits were as follows:

accrued liabilities                     $159,324             $127,129
3.  investments as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, our investments consisted of u.s. treasury notes with maturities up to approximately one year and were classified as available-for-sale.  fair value of u.s. treasury notes is measured on a recurring basis based on level 1 inputs (quoted prices for identical assets in active markets).
the following is a summary of available-for-sale securities:
the following is a summary of unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income:
unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities               $(274)              $2,251        $(2,468)
unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities, net of tax   $(186)              $1,402        $(1,522)
realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded in interest and other income on the consolidated statement of income. we had no realized gains or losses for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2015, and $547 of realized gains on available-for-sale securities for the year ended december 31, 2016. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $244 in interest and other income in the consolidated statement of income in connection with a decline in the fair market value of certain available-for-sale securities.
we have elected to fund certain deferred compensation obligations through a rabbi trust, the assets of which are designated as trading securities, as described further in note 7. "employee benefit plans."
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act, (the "tcja") was enacted.  the tcja includes a number of changes to existing u.s. tax laws that impact the company, most notably a reduction of the u.s. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017.  we recorded a benefit of $6,047 ($0.21 per basic and diluted earnings per share) in deferred income tax expense for the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability at the 21% tax rate. the tcja also provides for acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after september 27, 2017, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018, including additional limitations on deductibility of executive compensation and employee meal benefits.
the $6,047 benefit represents what we believe is the impact of the tcja.  as the benefit is based on currently available information and interpretations, which are continuing to evolve, the benefit should be considered provisional.  we will continue to analyze additional information and guidance related to the tcja as supplemental legislation, regulatory guidance, or evolving technical interpretations become available.  the final impacts may differ from the recorded amounts as of december 31, 2017, and we will continue to refine such amounts within the measurement period provided by staff accounting bulletin no. 118.  we expect to complete our analysis no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.
actual taxes paid for 2016 and 2015 were less than the current tax expense due to the excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation of $1,320 and $74,442 during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

the 2017 effective tax rate was lower than the 2016 rate due to the enactment of the tcja and a lower state tax rate, partially offset by federal credits on overall higher pre-tax operating income. the 2016 effective tax rate was higher than 2015 due to a higher state tax rate, not qualifying for the federal research and development tax credit in 2016, and other federal credits on overall lower pre-tax operating income.
deferred income tax liabilities are taxes we expect to pay in future periods. similarly, deferred income tax assets are recorded for expected reductions in taxes payable in future periods. deferred income taxes arise because of the differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities.
deferred income tax liabilities and assets consist of the following:
deferred income tax liability:
total deferred income tax liability                                147,438                212,508
gift card liability                                                  4,580                  5,563
capitalized transaction costs                                          324                    500
stock-based compensation and other employee benefits                80,447                101,628
state credits                                                        5,589                  4,595
net deferred income tax liability                                     $814                $18,944
the december 31, 2017, deferred tax liability was measured using a 21% u.s. federal tax rate because of the enactment of tcja, which reduced the rate from 35%.
as of december 31, 2017, we have $8,468 of deferred tax assets related to outstanding non-vested stock awards that contain market conditions. if market conditions are not achieved, then we may not realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets, which would result in a higher effective tax rate in future periods.
the unrecognized tax benefits are as follows:
increase resulting from prior year tax position               -               -               402
increase resulting from current year tax position         4,726             435             2,032
during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recognized $364, $430, and $0, respectively, in interest expense related to uncertain tax positions. we have $794 and $430 for the payment of interest accrued at december 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  we are open to federal and state tax audits until the applicable statutes of limitations expire. tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. we are no longer subject to u.s. federal tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2014. for the majority of states where we have a significant presence, we are no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2014.  as of december 31, 2017, we had cumulative gross foreign net operating losses of $50,292, which have no expiration date.
5. shareholders' equity through december 31, 2017, we had announced authorizations by our board of directors of repurchases of shares of common stock, which in the aggregate, authorized expenditures of up to $2,400,000. under the remaining repurchase authorizations, shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, subject to market conditions.
during 2017, 2016, and 2015, shares of common stock were netted and surrendered as payment for minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the exercise and vesting of outstanding stock awards. we deem shares surrendered by the participants in accordance with the applicable award agreements and plan as repurchased, but do not deem such shares to be part of publicly announced share repurchase programs.
6. stock-based compensation we issue shares in connection with stock-based compensation pursuant to the amended and restated chipotle mexican grill, inc. 2011 stock incentive plan. for purposes of counting the shares remaining available under the 2011 incentive plan, each share issuable pursuant to outstanding full value awards, such as restricted stock units and performance shares, counts as two shares used, whereas each share underlying a stock appreciation right or stock option counts as one share used. under the 2011 incentive plan, 5,560 shares of common stock have been authorized and reserved for issuance to eligible participants, of which 1,786 represent shares that were authorized for issuance but not issued or subject to outstanding awards at december 31, 2017. the 2011 incentive plan is administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors, which has the authority to select the individuals to whom awards will be granted or to delegate its authority under the plan to make grants (subject to certain legal and regulatory restrictions), to determine the type of awards and when the awards are to be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each award, the vesting schedule and all other terms and conditions of the awards. the exercise price for stock awards granted under the 2011 incentive plan cannot be less than fair market value at the date of grant.
stock-based compensation expense recognized as capitalized development                       $1,141             $946           $1,554
excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation recognized in provision for income taxes        $448               $-               $-
the tables below summarize the sosar activity under the stock incentive plans (in thousands, except years and per share data):
forfeited or cancelled            (187)                                           $527.53        (113)                                          $559.25         (56)                                          $554.73
in the past, we have granted sosars that included performance conditions. as of december 31, 2017, 278 outstanding sosars that included performance conditions were determined to have met the performance conditions. for the remaining 110 outstanding sosars that included performance conditions, the financial targets underlying the performance conditions had been satisfied as of december 31, 2017, and vesting of the awards was pending confirmation by the compensation committee that the performance conditions were met. the total intrinsic value of options and sosars exercised during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $4,296, $15,946 and $260,466. unearned compensation as of december 31, 2017 was $21,998 for sosar awards, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.
volatility                                                                      29.9   %            32.2   %            30.8   %
the risk-free interest rate is based upon u.s. treasury rates for instruments with similar terms and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data. we have not paid dividends to date and do not plan to pay dividends in the near future. the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility.
a summary of non-vested stock award activity under the 2011 stock incentive plans and prior stock compensation plan is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):
forfeited or cancelled             (31)                                         $502.46         (74)                                        $529.54            -                                        $534.55
there were 141 non-vested stock awards with a weighted average grant date fair value per share of $522.38 that were vested and expected to vest as of december 31, 2017. the aggregate intrinsic value of the shares was $32,829 and the weighted average remaining contractual life was 5.8 years. unearned compensation for non-vested stock awards we have determined are probable of vesting was $37,962 as of december 31, 2017, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. the fair value of shares earned as of the vesting date during the year ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $3,524, $2,787, and $634, respectively.
as of december 31, 2017, 133 of the outstanding non-vested stock awards were subject to performance and/or market conditions, in addition to service vesting conditions. during the first quarter of 2017, we awarded 36 performance shares that are subject to service, market and performance vesting conditions. two-thirds of the shares had a grant date fair value of $485.53 per share and have vesting criteria based on the price of our common stock reaching certain targets for a consecutive number of days during the three-year period starting on the grant date, with the quantity of shares that vest ranging from 0% to 350% of the targeted number of shares. the remaining one-third of the shares had a grant date fair value of $427.61 and have vesting criteria based on reaching certain comparable restaurant sales increases during the three-year period starting on january 1, 2017, with the quantity of shares that vest ranging from 0% to 300% of the targeted number of shares.  if the defined minimum targets are not met, then no shares will vest.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we awarded 73 performance shares, net of cancellations, that are subject to both service and market vesting conditions. the quantity of shares that vest will range from 0% to 400% of a targeted number of shares, and will be determined based on the price of our common stock reaching certain targets for a consecutive number of days during the three-year period starting on the grant date.  if the minimum defined stock price target is not met, then no shares will vest.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we awarded 40 performance shares that were subject to service, performance, and market vesting conditions. the quantity of shares that vest will be determined based on our relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in annual average revenue growth, net income growth, and total shareholder return. the quantity of shares that vest will range from 0% to 200% based on the level of achievement of the performance and market conditions. if minimum targets are not met, then no shares will vest. each performance and market measure will be weighted equally, and performance is calculated over a three-year period beginning january 1, 2015 through december 31, 2017.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, 20 stock awards that were subject to service and performance or market conditions were forfeited.
measurement of the grant date fair value of the stock awards with market conditions included a monte carlo simulation model, which incorporates into the fair value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, using the following assumptions:
volatility                       29.9   %          31.4   %          33.7   %
7. employee benefit plans we maintain the chipotle mexican grill 401(k) plan (the "401(k) plan"). we match 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and 50% on the next 2% of pay contributed. employees become eligible to receive matching contributions after one year of service with the company. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, matching contributions totaled approximately $6,072, $5,939 and $4,995, respectively.
we also maintain the chipotle mexican grill, inc. supplemental deferred investment plan (the "deferred plan") which covers our eligible employees. the deferred plan is a non-qualified plan that allows participants to make tax-deferred contributions that cannot be made under the 401(k) plan because of internal revenue service limitations. participants' earnings on contributions made to the deferred plan fluctuate with the actual earnings and losses of a variety of available investment choices selected by the participant. total liabilities under the deferred plan as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 were $19,887 and $17,843, respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. we match 100% of the first 3% of pay contributed by each eligible employee and 50% on the next 2% of pay contributed once the 401(k) contribution limits are reached. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we made deferred compensation matches of $199, $225, and $617, respectively, to the deferred plan.
we have elected to fund our deferred compensation obligation through a rabbi trust. the rabbi trust is subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency, but the assets held in the rabbi trust are not available for general corporate purposes. amounts in the rabbi trust are invested in mutual funds, consistent with the investment choices selected by participants in their deferred plan accounts, which are designated as trading securities and carried at fair value, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. fair value of mutual funds is measured using level 1 inputs (quoted prices for identical assets in active markets), and the fair values of the investments in the rabbi trust were $19,887 and $17,843 as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. trading gains and losses are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income, along with the offsetting amount related to the increase or decrease in deferred compensation to reflect its exposure of the deferred plan liability.
the following table sets forth unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities held in the rabbi trust:
unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities held in rabbi trust      $1,520           $586        $(571)
we also offer an employee stock purchase plan ("espp"). employees become eligible to participate after one year of service with chipotle and may contribute up to 15% of their base earnings, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount, toward the monthly purchase of our common stock. under the espp, 250 shares of common stock have been authorized and reserved for issuances to eligible employees, of which 246 represent shares that were authorized for issuance but not issued at december 31, 2017.  for each of the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the number of shares issued under the espp were less than 1.
8. leases our restaurants are generally operated in leased premises. lease terms for traditional shopping center or building leases generally include combined initial and option terms of 20-25 years. ground leases generally include combined initial and option terms of 30-40 years. the option terms in each of these leases are typically in five-year increments. typically, the lease includes rent escalation terms every five years including fixed rent escalations, escalations based on inflation indexes, and fair market value adjustments. certain leases contain contingent rental provisions that include a fixed base rent plus an additional percentage of the restaurant's sales in excess of stipulated amounts. our leases generally provide for the payment of common area maintenance, property taxes, insurance and various other use and occupancy costs. in addition, we are the lessee under non-cancelable leases covering certain offices.
we have six sales and leaseback transactions. these transactions do not qualify for sale leaseback accounting because of our deemed continuing involvement with the buyer-lessor due to fixed price renewal options, which results in the transaction being recorded under the financing method. under the financing method, the assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet and the proceeds from the transactions are recorded as a financing liability.  a portion of lease payments are applied as payments of deemed principal and imputed interest. the deemed landlord financing liability was $2,630 and $2,854 as of december 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively, with the current portion of the liability included in accrued liabilities, and the remaining portion included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
9. earnings per share basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. diluted earnings per share ("diluted eps") is calculated using income available to common shareholders divided by diluted weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during each period. potentially dilutive securities include shares of common stock underlying sosars and non-vested stock awards (collectively "stock awards"). diluted eps considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities except in periods in which there is a loss because the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. stock awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted eps in the event they are subject to performance conditions or antidilutive. the following stock awards were excluded from the calculation of diluted eps:
stock awards subject to performance conditions                       217               263            266
10. commitments and contingencies purchase obligations we enter into various purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business, generally of a short term nature. those that are binding primarily relate to commitments for food purchases and supplies, amounts owed under contractor and subcontractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction, and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships.
litigation data security incident    in april 2017, our information security team detected unauthorized activity on the network that supports payment processing for our restaurants, and immediately began an investigation with the help of leading computer security firms. we also self-reported the issue to payment card processors and law enforcement. our investigation detected malware designed to access payment card data from cards used at point-of-sale devices at most chipotle restaurants, primarily in the period from march 24, 2017 through april 18, 2017. the malware searched for track data, which may include cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and internal verification codes; however, no other customer information was affected. we have removed the malware from our systems and continue to evaluate ways to enhance our security measures. we expect that substantially all of our investigation costs will be covered by insurance; however, we may incur legal expenses in excess of our insurance coverage limits associated with the data security incident in future periods. we will recognize these expenses as services are received.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded an expense of $30,000 ($18,234 after tax), or $0.64 per diluted earnings per share, as an estimate of potential liabilities associated with anticipated claims and assessments by payment card networks in connection with the data security incident. we may ultimately be subject to liabilities greater than or less than the amount accrued. the expense is recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income and a corresponding liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
litigation arising from security incident    on may 4, 2017, bellwether community credit union filed a purported class action complaint in the united states district court for the district of colorado alleging that we negligently failed to provide adequate security to protect the payment card information of customers of the plaintiffs and those of other similarly situated credit unions, banks and other financial institutions alleged to be part of the putative class, causing those institutions to suffer financial losses.  the complaint also claims we were negligent per se based on alleged violations of section 5 of the federal trade commission act and similar state laws.  the plaintiff seeks monetary damages, injunctive relief and attorneys' fees.  on may 26, 2017, alcoa community credit union filed a purported class action complaint in the u. s. district court for the district of colorado making substantially the same allegations as the bellwether complaint and seeking substantially the same relief. the bellwether and alcoa cases have been consolidated and will proceed as a single action.
on june 9, 2017, todd gordon filed a purported class action complaint in the u. s. district court for the district of colorado alleging that we negligently failed to provide adequate security to protect the payment card information of the plaintiff and other similarly situated customers alleged to be part of the putative class, causing some customers to suffer alleged injuries and others to be at risk of possible future injuries.  the complaint also claims we were negligent per se based on alleged violations of section 5 of the federal trade commission act and similar state laws, and also alleges breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and violations of the arizona consumer fraud act. additionally, on august 21, 2017, greg lawson and judy conard filed a purported class action complaint in the u. s. district court for the district of colorado making allegations substantially similar to those in the gordon complaint, and stating substantially similar claims as well as claims under the colorado consumer protection act. the gordon and lawson/conard cases have been consolidated and will proceed as a single action.
we intend to vigorously defend each of the aforementioned cases, but it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from these cases.  although certain fees and costs associated with the data security incident and the aforementioned litigation to date have been paid or reimbursed by our cyber liability insurer, the ultimate amount of liabilities arising from the litigation may be in excess of the limits of our applicable insurance coverage.
receipt of grand jury subpoenas on january 28, 2017, we were served with a federal grand jury subpoena from the u.s. district court for the central district of california in connection with an official criminal investigation being conducted by the u.s. attorney's office for the central district of california, in conjunction with the u.s. food and drug administration's office of criminal investigations.  the subpoena requires the production of documents and information related to company-wide food safety matters dating back to january 1, 2013.  we received a follow-up subpoena on july 19, 2017 requesting information related to illness incidents associated with a single chipotle restaurant in sterling, virginia. we intend to continue to fully cooperate in the investigation.  it is not possible at this time to determine whether we will incur, or to reasonably estimate the amount of, any fines or penalties in connection with the investigation pursuant to which the subpoena was issued.
shareholder derivative actions on april 6, 2016, uri skorski filed a shareholder derivative action in colorado state court in denver, colorado, alleging that our board of directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties in connection with our alleged failure to disclose material information about our food safety policies and procedures, and also alleging that our board of directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties in connection with allegedly excessive compensation awarded from 2011 to 2015 under our stock incentive plan. on april 14, 2016, mark arnold and zachary arata filed a shareholder derivative action in colorado state court in denver, colorado, making largely the same allegations as the skorski complaint.  on may 26, 2016, the court issued an order consolidating the skorski and arnold/arata actions into a single case. on august 8, 2016, sean gubricky filed a shareholder derivative action the u.s. district court for the district of colorado, alleging that our board of directors and certain officers failed to institute proper food safety controls and policies, issued materially false and misleading statements in violation of federal securities laws, and otherwise breached their fiduciary duties.  on september 1, 2016, ross weintraub filed a shareholder derivative action in colorado state court in denver, colorado, making largely the same allegations as the gubricky complaint. on march 27, 2017, the weintraub case was consolidated with the skorski and arnold/arata action into a single case.  on december 27, 2016, cyrus lashkari filed a shareholder derivative action the u.s. district court for the district of colorado, making largely the same allegations as the foregoing shareholder derivative complaints.  each of these actions purports to state a claim for damages on our behalf, and is based on statements in our sec filings and related public disclosures, as well as media reports and company records. we have reached an agreement in principle to settle the foregoing actions, and have recorded a corresponding liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet; the proposed settlement has been preliminarily approved by the u.s. district court for the district of colorado, with a final approval hearing set for march 15, 2018.
on july 28, 2017, mark blau filed a shareholder derivative action in the u.s. district court for the district of colorado, making allegations similar to those of the several shareholder derivative actions described above, and adding further allegations related to the board's investigation of the foregoing matters, as well as customer illnesses and operational issues associated with two chipotle restaurants in july 2017.  the action purports to state claims for damages on our behalf, and is based on statements in our sec filings and related public disclosures, as well as media reports and company records.  on february 2, 2018, the court stayed this matter pending the outcome of the march 15, 2018 settlement approval hearing in the consolidated gubricky actions described above.      shareholder class actions     on january 8, 2016, susie ong filed a complaint in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of shares of our common stock between february 4, 2015 and january 5, 2016. the complaint purports to state claims against us, each of the co-chief executive officers serving during the claimed class period and the chief financial officer under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the exchange act and related rules, based on our alleged failure during the claimed class period to disclose material information about our quality controls and safeguards in relation to consumer and employee health. the complaint asserts that those failures and related public statements were false and misleading and that, as a result, the market price of our stock was artificially inflated during the claimed class period. the complaint seeks damages on behalf of the purported class in an unspecified amount, interest, and an award of reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees and other costs. on march 8, 2017, the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint, with leave to amend.  the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on april 7, 2017.  on june 7, 2017, chipotle filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, and briefing on that motion was completed on september 6, 2017.   additionally, on july 20, 2017, elizabeth kelley filed a complaint in the u.s. district court for the district of colorado on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of shares of our common stock between february 5, 2016 and july 19, 2017, with claims and factual allegations similar to the ong complaint, based primarily on media reports regarding illnesses associated with a chipotle restaurant in sterling, virginia. a response to the amended complaint in that matter is due on february 12, 2018.  we intend to defend these cases vigorously, but it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the outcome of or any potential liability from the cases.
miscellaneous    we are involved in various other claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. however, a significant increase in the number of these claims, or one or more successful claims under which we incur greater liabilities than we currently anticipate, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.     11. quarterly financial data (unaudited)
summarized unaudited quarterly financial data:
item 9.changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none.
item  9a.controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act")) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in exchange act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31, 2017, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended december 31, 2017 in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rule 13a-15(f) under the exchange act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.    management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting the management of chipotle mexican grill, inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with item 6. "selected financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data." the discussion contains forward-looking statements involving risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our results to differ materially from expectations. factors that might cause such differences include those described in item 1a. "risk factors" and elsewhere in this report.  overview steve ells, our founder, chairman and ceo, started chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. today, we continue to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in an interactive style allowing people to get what they want. we seek out extraordinary ingredients that are not only fresh, but that are raised responsibly, with respect for the animals, land, and people who produce them. we prepare our food using real, wholesome ingredients and without the use of artificial colors or flavors typically found in fast food. chipotle opened with a single restaurant in denver in 1993 and as of december 31, 2017, we operated 2,408 restaurants.
sales. our sales and profitability improved during 2017 as compared to 2016. comparable restaurant sales increased 6.4% as a result of an increase in the average check, including a 1.2% benefit from menu price increases implemented in about 500 restaurants during the second quarter of 2017 and 900 restaurants during the fourth quarter of 2017. comparable restaurant sales represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants beginning in their 13th full calendar month of operation. average restaurant sales were $1.940 million as of december 31, 2017, increasing from $1.868 million as of december 31, 2016. we define average restaurant sales as the average trailing 12-month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months.  we expect comparable restaurant sales increases in the low single digits for the full year 2018, including the benefit from extending menu price increases to almost 950 additional restaurants in january 2018.  sales growth from new restaurant openings, however, will be lower in 2018 than in the past due to our planned decrease in new restaurant openings during the year, as discussed below under "restaurant development."
during 2017, we invested in improving our digital platforms, including significant improvements to our mobile application and online ordering platform, and equipping select restaurants with an upgraded second make line dedicated to fulfilling out-of-restaurant orders. sales from out-of-restaurant orders represented 8.3% of our revenue during the year ended december 31, 2017, up from 6.4% of revenue during the year ended december 31, 2016. additionally, in september 2017 we introduced an all-natural queso, which was ordered in approximately 10% of our transactions in january 2018.     restaurant operating costs. during the full year 2017, our restaurant operating costs (food, beverage and packaging; labor; occupancy; and other operating costs) as a percent of revenue decreased 4.1% compared to the full year 2016. the decrease was attributable to sales leverage, including the benefit of the menu price increases, lower marketing and promotional spend as a percent of revenue, and labor efficiencies, partially offset by higher wages paid to crew and managers.
restaurant development. as of december 31, 2017, we had 2,408 restaurants in operation, including 2,363 chipotle restaurants throughout the united states, with an additional 37 international chipotle restaurants and eight non-chipotle restaurants that were consolidated into our financial results.  we opened 183 restaurants in 2017, including two relocations, and closed 23 additional restaurants (including 15 shophouse southeast asian kitchen restaurants). we intend to open between 130 and 150 restaurants for the full year 2018, as we focus our resources on improving our operations and delivering an outstanding experience to every one of our guests. most of our 2018 restaurant openings are planned in markets that already have a chipotle presence established.
tax law changes.  in december 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law, and among other changes, the act lowered the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.  as a result, we recognized a $6.0 million benefit in our provision for income taxes related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax position at the lower rate.
we expect our 2018 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 30% to 31%, which includes an underlying effective tax rate of 27% to 28%, and around 3% to 4% related to stock awards. as discussed in note 1. "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data," the adoption of asu no. 2016-09, "compensation-stock compensation (topic 718)" will subject our tax rate to quarterly volatility from the effect of stock award exercise and vesting activities. additionally, we have deferred tax assets related to outstanding non-vested stock awards that contain market conditions. if market conditions are not achieved, then we may not realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets, which would result in a higher effective tax rate in future periods.  we believe the stock awards granted in 2015 and 2016 that contain market conditions will increase our tax rate in the first and fourth quarters of 2018, respectively.
during 2018, we expect to use a portion of the savings from the lower federal corporate income tax rate to provide enhanced benefits to our employees, including by making all restaurant managers and crew eligible for a one-time cash bonus, awarding one-time stock bonuses to a broad group of staff employees, and enhancing a number of other benefits such as parental leave and short-term disability.  additionally, we will use a portion of the savings by investing in our existing restaurants.  we expect these initiatives to increase labor, other operating, and general and administrative expenses, and to result in higher capital expenditures than we have typically incurred.
management and governance. during the second quarter of 2017, we announced that we hired scott boatwright as chief restaurant officer, and scott has assumed oversight of operations for all north american chipotle restaurants. in the fourth quarter of 2017, we announced that steve ells, our chairman and ceo, will become executive chairman following the completion of a search to identify a new ceo.  for risks associated with our planned installation of a new ceo, see "risks related to our unique business strategy - our success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel, and upcoming changes in our management team may not provide the benefits we expect" in item 1a. "risk factors."
data security incident. in april 2017, we detected malware on the network that supports payment processing for our restaurants, and subsequently determined that the malware searched for track data, which may include cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and internal verification codes. we removed the malware from our systems and continue to evaluate ways to enhance our security measures. see "general business risks-we may be harmed by security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer and employee information" in item 1a. "risk factors," as well as note 10. "commitments and contingencies" in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data," for further discussion of the payment card security incident and related legal proceedings.
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we recorded a liability of $30.0 million ($18.2 million after tax), or $0.64 per basic and diluted earnings per share, as an estimate of potential losses associated with anticipated claims and assessments by payment card networks.  we may ultimately be subject to liabilities greater or less than the amount accrued.
restaurant openings, relocations and closures the following table details restaurant unit data for the years indicated.
the significant factors contributing to the increase in revenue in 2017 were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases. revenue from restaurants not yet in the comparable restaurant base contributed $338.8 million to the revenue increase, of which $149.1 million was attributable to restaurants opened in 2017, and comparable restaurant sales increased $233.2 million. the increase in comparable restaurant sales was attributable to an increase in average check, including a 1.2% benefit from menu price increases.
food, beverage and packaging costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 primarily due to the benefit of the menu price increases taken in select restaurants during the second and fourth quarters of 2017. food, beverage and packaging costs also benefitted from bringing the preparation of lettuce and bell peppers back into our restaurants after using pre-cut produce during portions of 2016, and cost savings initiatives resulting in lower prices and usage of paper and packaging products. these decreases were partially offset by higher avocado prices. we expect food, beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue in 2018 to be lower than 2017 due to the benefit of menu price increases, and our expectations for stable commodity prices.
labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased during the year ended december 31, 2017 due primarily to increased crew efficiency, including the benefit of lower promotional activity during the year, improved manager deployment, and sales leverage, including the impact of menu price increases.  the decrease was partially offset by wage inflation.   we expect labor costs as a percentage of revenue to be higher in 2018 than 2017 due to labor inflation and the enhanced benefits described above under "overview - tax law changes."
occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to lower average restaurant sales on a largely fixed-cost base. occupancy costs increased in dollar terms for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to costs associated with new restaurants.
other operating costs include, among other items, marketing and promotional costs, bank and credit card fees, and restaurant utilities and maintenance costs. other operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2017 due primarily to decreased marketing and promotional spend, sales leverage including the benefit of menu price increases, and decreased kitchen supplies expense. marketing and promotional spend decreased to 3.5% of revenue in 2017, as compared to 5.1% of revenue in 2016.  we expect other operating costs as a percentage of revenue in 2018 to remain consistent with 2017 as planned lower marketing and promotional spend is offset by expected higher maintenance costs from investments in our existing restaurants.
general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms in 2017, due to recording a liability of $30.0 million as an estimate of potential losses associated with anticipated claims and assessments by payment card networks for the data security incident that occurred in 2017. increased bonus costs and higher non-cash stock-based compensation expense also contributed to the increase. the increase was partially offset by lower legal costs, and decreased meeting costs because of the biennial all managers conference held in september 2016. the increase in stock-based compensation expense during 2017 was primarily a result of a cumulative reduction of expense in 2016 for performance share awards that were no longer expected to vest.  we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar terms in 2018 due to increased wages and benefits, the biennial all managers' conference planned for the third quarter of 2018, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense.
the increase in general and administrative expenses in dollar terms for 2016 primarily resulted from increased legal expense, higher payroll costs as we grew, and expenses associated with our biennial all managers' conference held during 2016, partially offset by lower bonus expense and travel costs.
depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue in 2016 due to sales deleveraging. the increase in dollar terms was due primarily to depreciation and amortization costs associated with new restaurants.
loss on disposal and impairment of assets during the year ended december 31, 2017 consisted primarily of charges related to the closure of underperforming chipotle restaurants and the replacement of certain kitchen equipment.
loss on disposal and impairment of assets increased in 2016 primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge of $14.5 million to write-down substantially all of the value of the long-lived assets of our 15 shophouse restaurants.
the 2017 annual effective tax rate was lower than the 2016 rate due to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, resulting in our recording a benefit for the remeasurement of our deferred tax liability, as well as from a lower state tax rate. the decrease in our effective tax rate was partially offset by federal credits on overall higher pre-tax operating income.
the 2016 effective tax rate was higher than 2015 due to a higher state tax rate, not qualifying for the federal research and development tax credit in 2016 whereas we did qualify for the credit in 2015, and other federal credits on overall lower pre-tax operating income.
quarterly financial data/seasonality the following table presents data from the consolidated statement of income for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31, 2017. the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter.
seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. historically our average daily restaurant sales are lower, and net income has generally been lower, in the first and fourth quarters due in part to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. for example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. seasonal factors, however, might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results, such as unexpected publicity impacting our business in a positive or negative way, as well as fluctuations in food or packaging costs or the timing of menu price increases. the number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results, although on an overall annual basis, changes in trading days do not have a significant impact.
our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the number of new restaurants opened in a quarter, the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and anticipated and unanticipated events. new restaurants typically have lower margins following opening as a result of the expenses associated with opening new restaurants and their operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction, initiatives to improve the guest experience in our restaurants, working capital, and general corporate needs. as of december 31, 2017, we had a cash and short-term investment balance of $509.0 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business, to invest in, maintain and refurbish our existing restaurants, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions, and for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2017, there was $118.3 million remaining available under repurchase authorizations previously approved by our board of directors. under the remaining repurchase authorizations, shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, subject to market conditions. we believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and investment balances, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.
we haven't required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. in addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverage and supplies some time after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth.
our total capital expenditures for 2017 were $216.8 million. in 2017, we spent on average about $835,000 in development and construction costs per new restaurant, or about $735,000 net of landlord reimbursements of $100,000.  in 2018, we expect to incur about $300 million in total capital expenditures.  we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to consist of investments in existing restaurants, including remodeling and similar improvements, and upgrading our second make lines and other restaurant equipment.  we also expect about $120 million in capital expenditures related to our construction of new restaurants, before any reductions for landlord reimbursements.  for new restaurants to be opened in 2018, we anticipate average development costs will increase due to initiatives planned in most of our new restaurants such as the addition of the upgraded second make line.  finally, we expect a portion of our capital expenditures for the year to be incurred for additional corporate initiatives.

(2)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms. we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. the majority of our purchase
obligations relate to amounts owed for chicken, produce, and other ingredients and supplies, construction contractor agreements, orders submitted for equipment for restaurants under construction and planned remodels, and marketing initiatives and corporate sponsorships.
the above table does not include income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. additionally, we have excluded our estimated loss contingencies related to the data security incident described elsewhere, due to uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of payment. see note 10. "commitments and contingencies" of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data."
inflation the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food, labor, healthcare costs, fuel, utility costs, and materials used in the construction of our restaurants. although a significant majority of our crew members make more than the federal and applicable state and local minimum wage, increases in the applicable federal or state minimum wage may have an impact on our labor costs by causing wage inflation above the minimum wage level. additionally, many of our leases require us to pay property taxes, maintenance, and utilities, all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases. in the past we have largely been able to offset inflationary increases with menu price increases. there have been, and there may be in the future, delays in implementing such menu price increases. if we do raise menu prices in the future, general competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover cost increases attributable to inflation.  critical accounting estimates we describe our significant accounting policies in note 1. "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies" of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data." critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. we believe that of our critical accounting estimates, the following involve a higher degree of judgement and subjectivity.    leases we lease nearly all of our restaurant locations. our leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term as well as optional renewal periods. we have estimated that our lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods, is the lesser of the lease term or 20 years.  we account for our leases by recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term. the majority of our leasehold improvements are also depreciated over the reasonably assured lease term.  if the estimate of our reasonably assured lease term was changed, our depreciation and rent expense could differ materially.
stock-based compensation we recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award's fair value. we use the black-scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock-only stock appreciation rights, or sosars, and we use the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock awards that contain market conditions. both of these models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price volatility, the expected life of the award and expected dividend rates. the volatility assumption was based on our historical data and implied volatility, and the expected life assumptions were based on our historical data. similarly, the compensation expense of performance share awards, and sosars with performance-based vesting conditions, is based in part on the estimated probability of our achieving levels of performance associated with particular levels of payout for performance shares and with vesting for performance sosars. we determine the probability of achievement of future levels of performance by comparing the relevant performance level with our internal estimates of future performance. those estimates are based on a number of assumptions, and different assumptions may have resulted in different conclusions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance relevant to the payout levels for the awards. had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected lives of our sosars, or different assumptions regarding the probability of our achieving future levels of performance with respect to performance share awards and performance sosars, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different. certain awards that contain service, performance and market conditions have vesting criteria based on chipotle's relative performance versus a restaurant industry peer group in annual average revenue growth,
net income growth, and total shareholder return. our estimates of chipotle's future performance and the future performance of the restaurant industry peer group are assumptions that involve a high degree of subjectivity. if we had arrived at different assumptions for revenue growth or net income for chipotle or the peer group, our stock-based compensation expense and results of operations could have been different.     insurance liability we are self-insured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers' compensation, general liability, employee health, property and auto damage, but have third party insurance coverage to limit exposure to these claims. we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. our history of claims experience is relatively short and our significant growth during most of our operating history could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. if a greater amount of claims occurs compared to what we have estimated, or if medical costs increase beyond what we expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated, which would result in expense reductions. unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs. the total estimated insurance liabilities as of december 31, 2017 were $52.0 million.
reserves/contingencies for litigation and other matters we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. these actions are subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcomes with any degree of certainty. consequently, we were unable to estimate the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters as of december 31, 2017. although we have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions, our estimates used to determine the amount of these liabilities may not be accurate, and there are other legal actions for which we have not recorded a liability.  as a result, in the event legal actions for which we have not accrued a liability or for which our accrued liabilities are not accurate are resolved, such resolution may affect our operating results and cash flows.
item  7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  commodity price risks we are exposed to commodity price risks. many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials and utilities to run our restaurants, are ingredients or commodities that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. we work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices, and range forward protocols under which we agree on a price range for the duration of that protocol. however, a majority of the dollar value of our purchases is effectively at spot prices. generally, our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 24 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. in several cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. we've tried to increase, where practical, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase, or if menu price increases result in customer resistance. changing interest rates we are also exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments. changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. as of december 31, 2017, we had $362.1 million in investments and interest-bearing cash accounts, including insurance-related restricted trust accounts classified in other assets, and $129.3 million in accounts with an earnings credit we classify as interest income, which combined earned a weighted average interest rate of 0.97%.  foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the u.s. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the u.s. dollar. however, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the u.s., and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date.

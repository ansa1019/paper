item 1a | risk factors item 1a | risk factors investing in aig involves risk. in deciding whether to invest in aig, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. any of these risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. they could also cause significant fluctuations and volatility in the trading price of our securities. readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect aig. these factors should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by us with the securities and exchange commission (sec). further, many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
market conditions deterioration of economic conditions, geopolitical tensions or weakening in global capital markets may materially affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. our businesses are highly dependent on global economic and market conditions. weaknesses in economic conditions and the capital markets have in the past led, and may in the future lead, to a poor operating environment, erosion of consumer and investor confidence, reduced business volumes, deteriorating liquidity and declines in asset valuations. adverse economic conditions may result from global economic and political developments, including plateauing business activity and inflationary pressures in developed economies, uncertainty surrounding china's ability to successfully maintain growth, the effects of brexit (as defined below) on business investment, hiring, migration and labor supply, intensifying trade protectionism, and tensions over north korea's nuclear program. these and other market, economic, and political factors could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in many ways, including (i) lower levels of consumer and commercial business activities that could decrease revenues and profitability and decrease value in goodwill, deferred tax assets and other long term assets, (ii) increases in credit spreads and defaults that could reduce investment asset valuations, increase credit losses across numerous asset classes, and increase statutory capital requirements and (iii) increased market volatility and uncertainty that could decrease liquidity and increase borrowing costs. other ways in which we could be negatively affected by economic conditions include, but are not limited to: increases in policy surrenders and cancellations; write-offs of deferred policy acquisition costs; increases in liability for future policy benefits due to loss recognition on certain long-duration insurance contracts; and increases in expenses associated with reinsurance, or decreased ability to obtain reinsurance at acceptable terms.
sustained low interest rates, or rapidly increasing interest rates, may materially and adversely affect our profitability. recent periods have been characterized by low interest rates relative to historical levels. sustained low interest rates can negatively affect the performance of our investment securities and reduce the level of investment income earned on our investment portfolios. if a low interest rate environment persists, we may experience lower investment income growth. due to practical and capital markets limitations, we may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities. continued low interest rates could also impair our ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our products at the time they were sold and issued. changes in interest rates may be correlated with inflation trends, which would impact our loss trends.
on the other hand, in periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest rate sensitive products competitive. therefore, we may have to accept a lower credit spread and, thus, lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. in addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates rise. this process may result in cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates. this may result in realized investment losses. an increase in interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio. this in turn could adversely affect our ability to realize our deferred tax assets.
reserves and exposures insurance liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss expenses. we regularly review the adequacy of the established loss reserves and conduct extensive analyses of our reserves during the year. our loss reserves, however, may develop adversely and materially impact our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
table of contents item 1a | risk factors for general insurance, estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process, particularly for long-tail liability lines of business. these lines include, but are not limited to, general liability, commercial automobile liability, environmental, workers' compensation, excess casualty and crisis management coverages, insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products, as well as excess and umbrella liability, errors and omissions, products liability, programs and specialty. there is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to new business, particularly new business that is generated with respect to more recently introduced product lines. in these cases, there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which the actuaries can rely. estimating reserves is further complicated by unexpected claims or unintended coverages that emerge due to changing conditions. these emerging issues may increase the size or number of claims beyond our underwriting intent and may not become apparent for many years after a policy is issued.
while we use a number of analytical reserve development techniques to project future loss development, reserves have been and may be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the reserves. for example, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded net charges of $1.0 billion, $5.4 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, to strengthen our general insurance loss reserves, reflecting adverse development in classes of business with long reporting tails, primarily in casualty and financial lines. these changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be due to changes in actual versus expected claims and losses, difficulties in predicting changes, such as changes in inflation, unemployment duration, or other social or economic factors affecting claims, including the judicial environment. any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period of time after we record the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year or number of years.
for life and retirement, experience may develop adversely such that additional reserves must be established. adverse experience could arise out of a severe short term event such as a pandemic, or due to misestimation of long-term assumptions such as mortality improvement and interest rate assumptions. while mortality experience is relatively stable due to the large amount of historical data available, assumptions in respect of other variables, such as policyholder behavior can be more difficult to estimate and may have a significant impact on reserves. life and retirement reserves and assumptions are reviewed quarterly and loss recognition testing and cash flow testing is carried out annually.
for a further discussion of our loss reserves see item 7. md&a - critical accounting estimates - insurance liabilities - loss reserves and insurance reserves - loss reserves and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events. events such as hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, earthquakes, wildfires, solar storms, acts of terrorism, explosions and fires, cyber-crimes, product defects, pandemic and other highly contagious diseases, mass torts and other catastrophes have adversely affected our business in the past and could do so in the future. for example, we had pre-tax catastrophe losses of $3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2017, which included losses from hurricanes harvey, irma and maria and the earthquake in mexico and pre-tax catastrophe losses of $766 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which included losses from the california wildfires.  in addition, we recognize the scientific consensus that climate change is a reality of increasing concern, indicated by higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, a warming atmosphere and ocean, diminished snow and ice, and sea level rise. we understand that climate change potentially poses a serious financial threat to society as a whole, with implications for the insurance industry in areas such as catastrophe risk perception, pricing and modeling assumptions. because there is significant variability associated with the impacts of climate change, we cannot predict how physical, legal, regulatory and social responses may impact our business.
•     widespread claim costs associated with property, workers' compensation, a&h, business interruption and mortality and morbidity claims;
•     limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets;
•     declines in value and/or losses with respect to companies and other entities whose securities we hold and counterparties we transact business with and have credit exposure to, including reinsurers, and declines in the value of investments; and
natural and man-made catastrophic events are generally unpredictable.  our exposure to catastrophic-related loss depends on various factors, including the frequency and severity of the catastrophes, the rate of inflation and the value and geographic or other concentrations of insured companies and individuals. vendor models and proprietary assumptions and processes that we use to manage catastrophe exposure may prove to be ineffective due to incorrect assumptions or estimates.
18                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors in addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions following major catastrophes could require us to pay the insured beyond the provisions of the original insurance policy and may prohibit the application of a deductible, resulting in inflated catastrophe claims.
for further details on potential catastrophic events, including a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain catastrophes, see item 7. md&a - enterprise risk management - insurance risks.
reinsurance may not be available or affordable and may not be adequate to protect us against losses. our subsidiaries are major purchasers of reinsurance and we use reinsurance as part of our overall risk management strategy. while reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their obligation to pay claims for losses insured under our policies, it does make the reinsurer liable to them for the reinsured portion of the risk. for this reason, reinsurance is an important tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention and to mitigate losses from catastrophes. market conditions beyond our control may impact the availability and cost of reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. for example, reinsurance may be more difficult or costly to obtain after a year with a large number of major catastrophes. we may, at certain times, be forced to incur additional costs for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms. in the latter case, we would have to accept an increase in exposure to risk, reduce the amount of business written by our subsidiaries or seek alternatives in line with our risk limits.
additionally, we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our subsidiaries' reinsurers to the extent the reinsurance receivable is not secured by collateral or does not benefit from other credit enhancements. we also bear the risk that a reinsurer may be unwilling to pay amounts we have recorded as reinsurance recoverable for any reason, including that (i) the terms of the reinsurance contract do not reflect the intent of the parties of the contract or there is a disagreement between the parties as to their intent, (ii) the terms of the contract cannot be legally enforced, (iii) the terms of the contract are interpreted by a court or arbitration panel differently than intended, (iv) the reinsurance transaction performs differently than we anticipated due to a flawed design of the reinsurance structure, terms or conditions, or (v) a change in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation of the laws and regulations, materially impacts a reinsurance transaction. the insolvency of one or more of our reinsurers, or inability or unwillingness to make timely payments under the terms of our contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity.
additionally, the use of reinsurance placed in the capital markets, may not provide the same levels of protection as traditional reinsurance transactions. any disruption, volatility and uncertainty in these markets, such as following a major catastrophic event, may limit our ability to access such markets on terms favorable to us or at all. also, to the extent that we intend to use structures based on an industry loss index or other non-indemnity trigger rather than on actual losses incurred by us, we could be subject to residual risk.
we currently have limited reinsurance coverage for terrorist attacks. further, the availability of private sector reinsurance for terrorism is limited. we rely heavily on the terrorism risk insurance program (trip), which provides u.s. government risk assistance to the insurance industry to manage the exposure to terrorism incidents in the u.s. trip was reauthorized in january 2015 and is scheduled to expire on december 31, 2020. under trip, once our losses for certain acts of terrorism exceed a deductible equal to 20 percent of our commercial property and casualty insurance premiums for covered lines for the prior calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for losses in excess of our deductible, starting at 85 percent of losses in 2015 (83 percent in 2017), and reducing by one percentage point each year, ending at 80 percent in 2020, up to a total industry program limit of $100 billion. trip does not cover losses in certain lines of business such as consumer property and consumer casualty. we also rely on the government sponsored and government arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-u.s. jurisdictions.
for additional information on our reinsurance recoverable, see item 7. md&a - enterprise risk management - insurance risks - reinsurance activities - reinsurance recoverable.
interest rate fluctuations, increased lapses and surrenders, declining investment returns and other events may require our subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (dac) and record additional liabilities for future policy benefits. we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. dac represents deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. the recovery of these costs is generally dependent upon the future profitability of the related business, but dac amortization varies based on the type of contract. for long-duration traditional business, dac is generally amortized in proportion to premium revenue and varies with lapse experience.  actual lapses in excess of expectations can result in an acceleration of dac amortization.
table of contents item 1a | risk factors and we may experience an increase in surrenders and withdrawals of life and annuity contracts, resulting in a decrease in future profitability and an acceleration of the amortization of dac.
we also periodically review products for potential loss recognition events, principally insurance-oriented products.  this review involves estimating the future profitability of in-force business and requires significant management judgment about assumptions including mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns, including net realized capital gains (losses). if actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses, we may be required to amortize any remaining dac and record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense, which could negatively affect our results of operations.
for further discussion of dac and future policy benefits, see item 7. md&a - critical accounting estimates and notes 9 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
investment portfolio, concentration of investments, insurance and other exposures the performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in interest rates.  our investment securities are subject to market risks and uncertainties. in particular, interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including monetary and fiscal policy, domestic and international economic and political issues and other factors beyond our control. changes in monetary policy or other factors may cause interest rate volatility, which would adversely affect the value of the fixed income securities that we hold and could adversely affect our ability to sell these securities. in addition, the evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairments, which may occur if interest rates rise, is a quantitative and qualitative process that is subject to significant management judgment.
for a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain market risk factors see item 7. md&a - enterprise risk management - market risk management.
additionally, on july 27, 2017, the uk financial conduct authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the libor rates after 2021, which is expected to result in these widely used reference rates no longer being available. at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor that may be enacted in the uk or elsewhere. uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for libor-based securities, including those held in our investment portfolio.
for discussion regarding changes to libor rates, see "changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of libor may affect our cost of capital and net investment income" below.
furthermore, our alternative investment portfolio includes investments for which changes in fair value are reported through operating income and are therefore subject to significant volatility.  in an economic downturn or declining market, the reduction in our investment income due to decreases in the fair value of alternative investments could have a material adverse effect on operating income.
our investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy. our results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the degree of concentration in our investment portfolio. we have significant exposure in real estate and real estate-related securities, including residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage loans. we also have significant exposures to financial institutions and, in particular, to money center and global banks; certain industries, such as energy and utilities; u.s. state and local government issuers and authorities; and euro-zone financial institutions, governments and corporations. events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industries or geographic region may adversely affect our investments to the extent they are concentrated in such segments. our ability to sell assets concentrated in such segments may be limited.
concentration of our insurance and other risk exposures may have adverse effects. we may be exposed to risks as a result of concentrations in our insurance policies, derivatives and other obligations that we undertake for customers and counterparties. we manage these concentration risks by monitoring the accumulation of our exposures to factors such as exposure type, industry, geographic region, counterparty and other factors. we also seek to use reinsurance, hedging and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures that exceed the limits we wish to retain. in certain circumstances, however, these risk management arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms or may prove to be ineffective for certain exposures. also, our exposure for certain single risk coverages and other coverages may be so large that adverse experience compared to our expectations may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or result in additional statutory capital requirements for our subsidiaries.

20                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors our valuation of investment securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. during periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our investment securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. there may be cases where certain assets in normally active markets with significant observable data become inactive with insufficient observable data due to the financial environment or market conditions in effect at that time. as a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods that are more complex. these values may not be realized in a market transaction, may not reflect the value of the asset and may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. decreases in value and/or an inability to realize that value in a market transaction or secured lending transaction may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
liquidity, capital and credit aig parent's ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited. as a holding company, aig parent depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends on aig common stock, to fund repurchases of aig common stock, warrants and debt obligations and to make payments due on its obligations, including its outstanding debt. the majority of our investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. our subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to aig parent in the future because of the need to support their own capital levels or because of regulatory limits or rating agency requirements. the inability of our subsidiaries to make payments, dividends or other distributions in an amount sufficient to enable aig parent to meet its cash requirements could have an adverse effect on our operations, and on our ability to pay dividends, repurchase aig common stock, warrants and debt obligations or to meet our debt service obligations.
our internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs, including providing capital that may be required by our subsidiaries. we need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt, maturing debt obligations and to meet capital needs of our subsidiaries. if our liquidity is insufficient to meet our needs, we may at the time need to have recourse to third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity, which may not be available or could be prohibitively expensive. the availability and cost of any additional financing at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit, regulatory actions and our credit ratings and credit capacity. it is also possible that, as a result of such recourse to external financing, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. disruptions, volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets, and downgrades in our credit ratings, may limit our ability to access external capital markets at times and on terms favorable to us to meet our capital and liquidity needs or prevent our accessing the external capital markets or other financing sources.
for a further discussion of our liquidity, see item 7. md&a - liquidity and capital resources.
aig parent's ability to support our subsidiaries is limited. aig parent has in the past and expects to continue to provide capital to our subsidiaries as necessary to maintain regulatory capital ratios, comply with rating agency requirements and meet unexpected cash flow obligations.  if aig parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a subsidiary, the credit rating agencies could downgrade the subsidiary insurer's financial strength ratings or the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could be seized by its regulator.
for further discussion of rating agency requirements, see "a downgrade in the insurer financial strength ratings of our insurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and retaining customers and business" below.
our subsidiaries may not be able to generate cash to meet their needs due to the illiquidity of some of their investments. our subsidiaries have investments in certain securities that may be illiquid, including certain fixed income securities and certain structured securities, private company securities, investments in private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage loans, finance receivables and real estate. collectively, investments in these assets had a fair value of $58 billion at december 31, 2017. adverse real estate and capital markets, and wider credit spreads, have in the past, and may in the future, materially adversely affect the liquidity of our other securities portfolios, including our residential and commercial mortgage‐related securities portfolios. in the event additional liquidity is required by one or more of our subsidiaries and aig parent is unable to provide it, it may be difficult for these subsidiaries to generate additional liquidity by selling, pledging or otherwise monetizing these less liquid investments.
table of contents item 1a | risk factors agency policies concerning the relationship between parent and subsidiary ratings, a downgrade in aig parent's credit ratings could result in a downgrade of the ifs ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. certain rating agencies negatively revised the outlook for our ifs ratings in early 2017, primarily as a result of our reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2016 and related concerns regarding our profitability outlook. we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business.
a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, our results of operations or our liquidity. credit ratings estimate a company's ability to meet its obligations. a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies could potentially increase our financing costs and limit the availability of financing. a downgrade would also require us to post additional collateral payments related to derivative transactions to which we are a party, and could permit the termination of these derivative transactions. this could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period and/or our liquidity. certain rating agencies negatively revised our credit ratings and ratings outlooks in early 2017, primarily as a result of our reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2016 and related concerns regarding our profitability outlook. we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business.
changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of libor may affect our cost of capital and net investment income. as a result of concerns about the accuracy of the calculation of libor, a number of british bankers' association (bba) member banks entered into settlements with certain regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to the alleged manipulation of libor.  actions by the bba, regulators or law enforcement agencies as a result of these or future events may result in changes to the manner in which libor is determined.
potential changes or uncertainty related to such potential changes may adversely affect the market for libor-based securities.  in addition, changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor, which could have an adverse impact on the market for libor-based securities or the value of our investment portfolio.
business and operations our restructuring initiatives may not yield our expected reductions in expenses and improvements in operational and organizational efficiency. we may not be able to fully realize the anticipated expense reductions and operational and organizational efficiency improvements we expect to result from our restructuring initiatives, including the reorganization of aig into general insurance and life and retirement segments. actual costs to implement these initiatives may exceed our estimates or we may be unable to fully implement and execute these initiatives as planned. the implementation of these initiatives may harm our relationships with customers or employees or our competitive position. our businesses and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we are unable to realize these anticipated expense reductions and efficiency improvements or if implementing these initiatives harms our relationships with customers or employees or our competitive position. the successful implementation of these initiatives may continue to require us to effect workforce reductions, business rationalizations, systems enhancements, business process outsourcing, business and asset dispositions and acquisitions and other actions, which depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.
pricing for our products is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks and estimate losses. we seek to price our insurance products such that insurance premiums, policy fees and charges, and future net investment income earned on revenues received will result in an acceptable profit in excess of expenses and the cost of paying claims. our business is dependent on our ability to price our products effectively and charge appropriate premiums.  pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors and assumptions, including proper evaluation of insurance risks, our expense levels, net investment income realized, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, legal and regulatory developments and the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes. some life insurance business has the ability to adjust certain nonguaranteed charges or benefits if necessary; however, this right is limited and may be subject to guaranteed minimums and/or maximums. inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
guarantees within certain of our products may increase the volatility of our results. certain of our variable annuity and life insurance products include features that guarantee a certain level of benefits, including guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (gmwb), and products with guaranteed interest crediting rates tied to an index.
for a discussion of market risk management related to these product features see item 7. md&a - enterprise risk management - insurance risks - life and retirement companies key risks - variable annuity risk management and hedging programs.
differences between the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with some of these guarantees and the related hedging portfolio can be caused by extreme and unanticipated movements in the equity markets, interest rates and market volatility, policyholder behavior that differs from our assumptions and our inability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with the
22                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 1a | risk factors desired risk and return trade-off.  the occurrence of one or more of these events could result in an increase in the liabilities associated with the guaranteed benefits, reducing our net income and shareholders' equity. while we believe that our actions have reduced the risks related to guaranteed benefits and guaranteed interest crediting, our exposure may not be fully hedged.
for more information regarding these products see notes 5 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, item 1. business - regulation, and item 7. md&a - critical accounting estimates - insurance liabilities - guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products.
our foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations. we provide insurance, investment and other financial products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 80 countries and jurisdictions. a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the u.s., and we intend to continue to grow business in strategic markets. operations outside the u.s. may be affected by regional economic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political events or upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which could also affect our other operations.
the degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. aig subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that local licenses may require aig parent to meet certain conditions. licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. consequently, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in some of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country.
on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom (uk) held a referendum in which a majority voted for the uk to withdraw its membership in the european union (eu), commonly referred to as brexit. the terms of withdrawal are subject to a formal two-year negotiation period that was initiated on march 29, 2017 by invoking article 50 of the treaty on european union. it is not clear at this stage (and may not be for some time) what form the uk's future relationship with the remaining eu member states will take. we have significant operations and employees in the uk and other eu member states, including aig europe ltd., which enjoys certain benefits based on the uk's membership in the eu. in order to adapt to brexit, we intend to reorganize our operations and legal entity structure in the uk and the eu through the establishment of a new european subsidiary in luxembourg.  such a reorganization will have various costs associated with it, such as notifications to policyholders, and may involve the replication of certain resources currently in place in the uk. the reorganization is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory and court approvals. there can be no assurance that future regulatory, tax or other developments will not affect this reorganization and change our plans. brexit has also affected the u.s. dollar/british pound exchange rate, increased the volatility of exchange rates among the euro, british pound and the japanese yen, and created volatility in the financial markets. it is possible that the uncertainty around the outcome of the negotiations between the uk and the eu will lead to further turbulence in the financial markets, which may affect the value of our investments.
we may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels. although we distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution channels, we maintain relationships with certain key distributors. distributors have in the past, and may in the future, elect to renegotiate the terms of existing relationships, or reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us, including for such reasons as industry consolidation of distributors or other industry changes that increase the competition for access to distributors, developments in legislation or regulation that affect our business, adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. an interruption in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition.
in addition, when our products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution, despite our training and compliance programs. if our products are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or distributed in any other inappropriate manner, we may suffer reputational and other harm to our business.
table of contents item 1a | risk factors them, and developments in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period.
if we are unable to maintain the availability of our electronic data systems and safeguard the security of our data, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. we use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and use customer, employee, and company data and information. some of these systems, in turn, rely upon third-party systems. our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems to perform necessary business functions. these functions include providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support, executing transactions and managing our investment portfolios. systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. in the event of a natural disaster, a computer virus, unauthorized access, a terrorist attack, cyberattack or other disruption inside or outside the u.s., our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time, and our employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. our systems have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to unauthorized access, such as physical or electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. like other global companies, we are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, system failures and disruptions. there is no assurance that our security measures, including information security policies, will provide fully effective protection from such events. aig maintains cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised. in some cases, such unauthorized access may not be immediately detected. this may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
in addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect personal, confidential or proprietary information. any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations enacted by u.s. federal and state governments, the european union or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. the compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could cause a loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations and result in reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.
we are continuously evaluating and enhancing systems and creating new systems and processes as our business depends on our ability to maintain and improve our technology systems for interacting with customers, brokers and employees. due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems and processes, these changes, as well as changes designed to update and enhance our protective measures to address new threats, increase the risk of a system or process failure or the creation of a gap in our security measures. any such failure or gap could adversely affect our business operations and the advancement of our restructuring initiatives.
business or asset acquisitions and dispositions may expose us to certain risks. the completion of any business or asset acquisition or disposition is subject to certain risks, including those relating to the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the terms and conditions of regulatory approvals, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of a transaction and the risk that parties may not be willing or able to satisfy the conditions to a transaction. as a result, there can be no assurance that any business or asset acquisition or disposition will be completed as contemplated, or at all, or regarding the expected timing of the completion of the acquisition or disposition. once we complete acquisitions or dispositions, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of any transaction. for example, the integration of businesses we acquire may not be as successful as we anticipate or there may be undisclosed risks present in such businesses.  acquisitions involve a number of risks, including operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, compliance and tax risks. difficulties integrating an acquired business may result in the acquired business performing differently than we expected (including through the loss of customers) or in our failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. our existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions. risks resulting from future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our

indemnity claims could be made against us in connection with divested businesses. we have provided financial guarantees and indemnities in connection with the businesses we have sold, as described in greater detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. while we do not currently believe that claims under these indemnities will be material, it is possible that significant indemnity claims could be made against us. if such a claim or claims were successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
for additional information on these financial guarantees and indemnities see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
our risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses. we have developed and continue to develop enterprise-wide risk management policies and procedures to mitigate risk and loss to which we are exposed.
there are, however, inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. if our risk management policies and procedures are ineffective, we may suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. as our businesses change and the markets in which we operate evolve, our risk management framework may not evolve at the same pace as those changes. as a result, there is a risk that new products or new business strategies may present risks that are not appropriately identified, monitored or managed. in times of market stress, unanticipated market movements or unanticipated claims experience resulting from adverse mortality, morbidity or policyholder behavior, the effectiveness of our risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in losses to us. in addition, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will follow our risk management policies and procedures.
regulation our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability. our operations generally, and our insurance subsidiaries, in particular, are subject to extensive and potentially conflicting supervision and regulation by national authorities and by the various jurisdictions in which we do business. supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition. federal, state and foreign regulators also periodically review and investigate our insurance businesses, including aig-specific and industry-wide practices. the primary purpose of insurance regulation is the protection of our insurance contract holders, and not our investors. the extent of domestic regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes, which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments.
we strive to maintain all required licenses and approvals. however, our businesses may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations. the relevant authority's interpretation of the laws and regulations also may change from time to time. regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. if we do not have the required licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, these authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. further, insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision, which permit them to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company.
in the u.s., the rbc formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. every state has adopted, in substantial part, the rbc model law promulgated by the naic or a substantially similar law, which specifies the regulatory actions the insurance regulator may take if an insurer's rbc calculations fall below specific thresholds. those actions range from requiring an insurer to submit a plan describing how it would regain a specified rbc ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. the naic and certain international standard-setting bodies are also considering methodologies for assessing group-wide regulatory capital, which might evolve into more formal group-wide capital requirements on certain insurance companies that may augment state-law rbc standards that apply at the legal entity level, and such capital calculations may be made, in whole or in part, on bases other than the statutory statements of our u.s. insurance subsidiaries. we cannot predict the effect these initiatives may have on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

certain provisions of dodd-frank remain relevant to insurance groups generally, including aig. the financial stability oversight council (council) rescinded our designation as a nonbank systemically important financial institution (nonbank sifi) on september 29, 2017, but the council remains authorized under dodd-frank to determine, subject to certain statutory and regulatory standards, that any nonbank financial company be designated as a nonbank sifi subject to supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system and enhanced prudential standards. the council may also recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that we and other insurers or other nonbank financial services companies, including insurers, engage in. additionally, dodd-frank directs existing and newly created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, which is an ongoing process. following the change in administration in the u.s., there is considerable uncertainty as to the potential adoption and timing of regulatory changes related to dodd-frank. we cannot predict the requirements of the regulations that may be ultimately adopted or the impact they may have on our businesses, results of operations or cash flows and financial condition.
see item 1. business - regulation - u.s. regulation - dodd-frank for further discussion of provisions of dodd-frank that remain relevant to insurance groups generally.
actions by foreign governments, regulators and international standard setters could result in substantial additional regulation to which we may be subject.  we cannot predict the impact laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions may have on the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows. it is possible such laws and regulations, the impact of our designation as a global systemically important insurer (g-sii), our status as an internationally active insurance group (iaig) and certain standard-setting initiatives by the fsb and the iais, including, but not limited to, the application of hla capital and the ongoing development of a risk-based global insurance capital standard (ics), and implementation of solvency ii in the european union, may significantly alter our business practices. they may also limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. it is possible that the laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions will differ from one another, and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions including the u.s.
for further details on these international regulations and their potential impact on aig and its businesses, see item 1. business - regulation - international regulation.
the usa patriot act, the office of foreign assets control regulations and similar laws and regulations that apply to us may expose us to significant penalties. the operations of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations, including, in some cases, the usa patriot act of 2001, which require companies to know certain information about their clients and to monitor their transactions for suspicious activities. also, the department of the treasury's office of foreign assets control administers regulations requiring u.s. persons to refrain from doing business, or allowing their clients to do business through them, with certain organizations or individuals on a prohibited list maintained by the u.s. government or with certain countries. the uk, the eu and other jurisdictions maintain similar laws and regulations. although we have instituted compliance programs to address these requirements, there are inherent risks in global transactions.
attempts to efficiently manage the impact of regulation xxx and actuarial guideline axxx may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. the naic model regulation "valuation of life insurance policies" (regulation xxx) requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees. in addition, naic actuarial guideline 38 (ag 38, also referred to as guideline axxx) clarifies the application of regulation xxx as to certain universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees.
our domestic life and retirement companies manage the capital impact of statutory reserve requirements under regulation xxx and guideline axxx through reinsurance transactions, to maintain their ability to offer competitive pricing and successfully market such products. if regulations change with respect to our ability to manage the capital impact of certain statutory reserve requirements, our statutory reserve requirements could increase, or our ability to take reserve credit for reinsurance transactions could be reduced or eliminated. as a result, we could be required to increase prices on our products, raise capital to replace the reserve credit provided by the reinsurance transactions or incur higher costs to obtain reinsurance, each of which could adversely affect our competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. if our actions to efficiently manage the impact of regulation xxx or guideline axxx on future sales of term and universal life insurance products are not successful, we may incur higher operating costs or our sales of these products may be affected.

new regulations may affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively. legislators and regulators may periodically consider various proposals that may affect our business practices and product designs, how we sell or service certain products we offer, or the profitability of certain of our businesses. new regulations may even affect our ability to conduct certain businesses at all, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions. these proposals could also impose additional taxes on a limited subset of financial institutions and insurance companies (either based on size, activities, geography, government support or other criteria). it is uncertain whether and how these and other such proposals would apply to us or our competitors or how they could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively.

an "ownership change" could limit our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income. as of december 31, 2017, on a tax basis, we had u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $35.6 billion, $305 million in capital loss carryforwards, $4.5 billion in foreign tax credits and $1.2 billion in other tax credits (tax loss and credit carryforwards). our ability to use these tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an "ownership change" as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the code). in general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of aig parent's ownership (by value) of one or more "5-percent shareholders" (as defined in the code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). an entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the irs (subject to certain adjustments). the annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. the limitation on our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards arising from an ownership change under section 382 would depend on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change.  if we were to experience an "ownership change", it is possible that a significant portion of our tax loss and credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income.
on march 9, 2011, our board adopted our tax asset protection plan (the plan) to help protect these tax loss and credit carryforwards, and on december 14, 2016, the board adopted an amendment to the plan, extending its expiration date to december 14, 2019. our shareholders ratified the amendment of the plan at our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders.  at our 2011 annual meeting of shareholders, shareholders adopted a protective amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation (protective amendment), which is designed to prevent certain transfers of aig common stock that could result in an "ownership change".  at our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, our shareholders approved the amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to adopt a successor to the protective amendment that contains substantially the same terms as the protective amendment but would expire on june 28, 2020.
the plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an "ownership change" by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99 percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of aig common stock. the protective amendment generally restricts any transfer of aig common stock that would (i) increase the ownership by any person to 4.99 percent or more of aig stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the percentage of aig stock owned by a five percent stockholder (as defined in the plan). despite the intentions of the plan and the protective amendment to deter and prevent an "ownership change", such an event may still occur. in addition, the plan and the protective amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us, and may discourage open market purchases of aig common stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for aig common stock. accordingly, the plan and the protective amendment may limit a shareholder's ability to realize a premium over the market price of aig common stock in connection with any stock transaction.
table of contents item 1a | risk factors deduction of certain executive compensation costs) will offset a portion of the benefits from the lower statutory rate.  other specific changes, including the calculation of insurance tax reserves and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, will impact the timing of our tax expense items and could impact the pricing of certain insurance products.
in addition to changing the taxation of corporations in general and insurance companies in particular, the tax act temporarily reduces certain tax rates for individuals and increases the exemption for the federal estate tax. these changes could reduce demand in the u.s. for life insurance and annuity contracts, which would reduce our income due to lower sales of these products or potential increased surrenders of in-force business.
furthermore, the overall impact of the tax act is subject to the effect of other complex provisions in the tax act (including the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat) and global intangible low-taxed income (gilti)), which aig continues to review.  it is possible that the impact from beat and gilti could reduce the benefit of the reduction in the statutory u.s. federal rate.  in addition, if beat induces other countries to enact similar legislation that could impact cross-border reinsurance transactions, aig could be negatively impacted by increased tax costs in those countries.
finally, it is possible that tax laws will be further changed either in a technical corrections bill or entirely new legislation.  the overall impact of the tax act also depends on the future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by u.s. tax authorities.  it remains difficult to predict whether or when there will be any tax law changes or further guidance by the authorities in the u.s. or elsewhere in the world having a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, as the impact of broad proposals on our business can vary substantially depending upon the specific changes or further guidance made and how the changes or guidance are implemented by the authorities.

competition and employees we face intense competition in each of our businesses. our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. our principal competitors are other large multinational insurance organizations, as well as banks, investment banks and other nonbank financial institutions. the insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. within the u.s., our general insurance companies compete with other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual insurance companies and other underwriting organizations. our life and retirement companies compete in the u.s. with life insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields. overseas, our subsidiaries compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large u.s. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies. technological advancements and innovation in the insurance industry may present competitive risks; technological advancements and innovation are occurring in distribution, underwriting and operations and at a pace that may increase. our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if technological advancements or innovation limit our ability to retain existing business, write new business at adequate rates or on appropriate terms, render our insurance products less suitable or impact our ability to adapt or deploy current products as quickly and effectively as our competitors.
reductions of our credit ratings or negative publicity may make it more difficult to compete to retain existing customers and to maintain our historical levels of business with existing customers and counterparties. general insurance companies and life and retirement companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, and terms and conditions. retirement services companies compete through crediting rates and the issuance of guaranteed benefits. a decline in our position as to any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability.
competition for employees in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business. our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. due to the intense competition in our industry for key employees with demonstrated ability, we may be unable to hire or retain such employees. in addition, we may experience higher than expected employee turnover and difficulty attracting new employees as a result of uncertainty from strategic actions and organizational and operational changes. losing any of our key people also could have a material adverse effect on our operations given their skills, knowledge of our business, years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key employees.
managing key employee succession and retention is critical to our success. we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key employees. while we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our employees, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.

third-party vendors we rely upon to provide certain business and administrative services on our behalf may not perform as anticipated, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. we have taken action to reduce coordination costs and take advantage of economies of scale by transitioning multiple functions and services to a small number of third-party providers. we periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. if such third-party providers experience disruptions or do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a transition to a third-party provider, we may experience operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations (including, but not limited to, policyholder obligations), a loss of business and increased costs, or suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

estimates and assumptions estimates used in the preparation of financial statements and modeled results used in various areas of our business may differ materially from actual experience. our financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap), which requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. the accounting policies that we consider most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore may be viewed as critical accounting estimates, are described in item 7. md&a - critical accounting estimates. these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. these estimates are based on judgment, current facts and circumstances, and, when applicable, internally developed models. therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates, possibly in the near term, and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
in addition, we employ models to price products, calculate reserves and value assets, as well as evaluate risk and determine capital requirements, among other uses. these models rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain, may use incomplete, outdated or incorrect data or assumptions and may not operate properly. as our businesses continue to expand and evolve, the number and complexity of models we employ has grown, increasing our exposure to error in the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated input data, controls and assumptions and the controls we have in place to mitigate their risk may not be effective in all cases.
changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could impact our reported results of operations and our reported financial position.  our financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised.   accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the financial accounting standards board (fasb). the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet required to be implemented is disclosed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
the international accounting standards board (iasb) has issued international financial reporting standard (ifrs) 17, insurance contracts, with an effective date of january 1, 2021.  this new standard will require significant changes to accounting measurements for long-duration insurance contracts for many of our international operations. the fasb is also nearing completion of its ongoing project to revise accounting standards for insurance contracts.  the fasb has focused on disclosures for short-duration insurance contracts, which primarily relate to our property casualty products, and on targeted improvements to accounting measurements and disclosures for long-duration insurance contracts, which primarily relate to our life and annuity products.  the effects of ifrs 17 are currently under review, while the final resolution of changes to insurance contracts under u.s. gaap has not yet been finalized. changes to the manner in which we account for insurance products could have a significant impact on our future financial reports, operations, capital management and business.  further, the adoption of a new insurance contracts standard as well as other future accounting standards could have a material effect on our reported results of operations and reported financial condition.
changes in our assumptions regarding the discount rate, expected rate of return, and expected compensation for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability. we determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. changes in these assumptions, including from the impact of a sustained low interest rate environment or rapidly rising interest rates, may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.

book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) and book value per common share, excluding aoci and deferred tax assets (dta) (adjusted book value per common share) are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. we believe these measures are useful to investors because they eliminate items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. these measures also eliminate the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. book value per common share excluding aoci, is derived by dividing total aig shareholders' equity, excluding aoci, by total common shares outstanding. adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig shareholders' equity, excluding aoci and dta (adjusted shareholders' equity), by total common shares outstanding. the reconciliation to book value per common share, the most comparable gaap measure, is presented in item 6. selected financial data.
return on equity - adjusted after-tax income excluding aoci and dta (adjusted return on equity) is used to show the rate of return on shareholders' equity. we believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio, foreign currency translation adjustments and u.s. tax attribute deferred tax assets. this measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. we exclude deferred tax assets representing u.s. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. as net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the dta utilized is included in adjusted return on equity. adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to aig by average adjusted shareholders' equity. the reconciliation to return on equity, the most comparable gaap measure, is presented in item 6. selected financial data.
adjusted after-tax income attributable to aig is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre-tax income (apti) adjustments described below and the following tax items from net income attributable to aig:
•     changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and
general operating expenses, adjusted basis is derived by making the following adjustments to general operating and other expenses: include (i) certain loss adjustment expenses, reported as policyholder benefits and losses incurred and (ii) certain investment and other expenses reported as net investment income, and exclude (i) advisory fee expenses, (ii) non-deferrable insurance commissions, (iii) direct marketing and acquisition expenses, net of deferrals and (iv) non-operating litigation reserves. we use general operating expenses, adjusted basis, because we believe it provides a more meaningful indication of our ordinary course of business operating costs, regardless of within which financial statement line item these expenses are reported externally within our segment results. the majority of these expenses are employee-related costs.  for example, other acquisition expenses and loss adjustment expenses primarily represent employee-related costs in the underwriting and claims functions, respectively.  excluded from this measure are non-operating expenses (such as restructuring costs and litigation reserves), direct marketing expenses, insurance company assessments and non-deferrable commissions.
38                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | use of non-gaap measures we use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. we believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. when we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the consolidated results of operations section of this md&a.
adjusted revenues exclude net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in other income for gaap purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in net investment income for gaap purposes). adjusted revenues is a gaap measure for our operating segments.
adjusted pre-tax income is derived by excluding the following items from income from continuing operations before income tax. this definition is consistent across our operating segments. these items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. apti is a gaap measure for our operating segments.

-   ratios: we, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. these ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for general insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. a combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under gaap, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. the underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. in addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.
-   accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted: both the accident year loss and combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. natural and man-made catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on aig in excess of $10 million each and also include certain man-made events, such as terrorism and civil disorders that meet the $10 million threshold. we believe the as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management's control. we also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.

table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment.
the accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of:
· valuation of future policy benefit liabilities and timing and extent of loss recognition;
· valuation of liabilities for guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products;
· estimated gross profits to value deferred acquisition costs for investment-oriented products;
· impairment charges, including other-than-temporary impairments on available for sale securities, impairments on other invested assets, including investments in life settlements, and goodwill impairment;
· liability for legal contingencies;
· fair value measurements of certain financial assets and liabilities; and
income tax assets and liabilities, including recoverability of our net deferred tax asset and the predictability of future tax operating profitability of the character necessary to realize the net deferred tax asset and provisional estimates associated with the tax act.
these accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.
insurance liabilities loss reserves the estimate of the loss reserves relies on several key judgments:
·       the determination of the appropriate groupings of similar product lines and, in some cases, the disaggregation of dissimilar losses within a product line.
all of our methods to calculate net reserves include assumptions about estimated reinsurance recoveries and their collectability. reinsurance collectability is evaluated independently of the reserving process and appropriate allowances for uncollectible reinsurance are established.
40                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates overview of loss reserving process and methods our loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups. short-tail reserves consists principally of u.s. property and special risks, europe property and special risks, u.s. personal insurance, and europe and japan personal insurance. long-tail reserves include u.s. workers' compensation, u.s. excess casualty, u.s. other casualty, u.s. financial lines, europe casualty and financial lines, and u.s. run-off long tail insurance lines.
short-tail reserves for our short-tail coverages, such as property, where the nature of claims is generally high frequency with short reporting periods, with volatility arising from occasional severe events, the process for recording non-catastrophe quarterly loss reserves is geared toward maintaining ibnr based on percentages of net earned premiums for that business, rather than projecting ultimate loss ratios based on reported losses. for example, the ibnr reserve required for the latest accident quarter for a product line such as homeowners might be approximately 20 percent of the quarter's earned premiums. this level of reserve would generally be recorded regardless of the actual losses reported in the current quarter, thus recognizing severe events as they occur. the percent of premium factor reflects both our expectation of the ultimate loss costs associated with the line of business and the expectation of the percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported.  the expected ultimate loss costs generally reflect the average loss costs from a period of preceding accident quarters that have been adjusted for changes in rate and loss cost levels, mix of business, known exposure to unreported losses, or other factors affecting the particular line of business. the expected percentage of ultimate loss costs that have not yet been reported would be derived from historical loss emergence patterns. for more mature quarters, specific loss development methods would be used to determine the ibnr. for other product lines where the nature of claims is high frequency but low severity, methods including loss development, frequency/severity or a multiple of average monthly losses may be used to determine ibnr reserves. ibnr for claims arising from catastrophic events or events of unusual severity would be determined in close collaboration with the claims department's knowledge of known information, using alternative techniques or expected percentages of ultimate loss cost emergence based on historical loss emergence of similar claim types.
long-tail reserves estimation of ultimate net losses and loss adjustment expenses (net losses) for our long-tail casualty lines of business is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, including the product line and volume of business, as well as estimates of  reinsurance recoveries. experience in the more recent accident years generally provides limited statistical credibility of reported net losses on long-tail casualty lines of business. that is because in the more recent accident years, a relatively low proportion of estimated ultimate net incurred losses are reported or paid. therefore, ibnr reserves constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses.
for our longer-tail lines, we generally make actuarial and other assumptions with respect to the following:
2017 loss reserve analysis) and, in some cases for accident years prior to the latest accident year. the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years, adjusted for the loss cost trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio. for low-frequency, high-severity lines of business such as excess casualty, expected loss ratios generally are used for at least the three most recent accident years.
tail factors are development factors used for certain longer tailed lines of business (for example, excess casualty, workers' compensation and general liability),to project future loss development for periods that extend beyond the available development data. the development of losses to the ultimate loss for a given accident year for these lines may take decades and the projection of ultimate losses for an accident year is very sensitive to the tail factors selected beyond a certain age.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates we record quarterly changes in loss reserves for each product line of business. the overall change in our loss reserves is based on the sum of the changes for all product lines of business. for most long-tail product lines of business, the quarterly loss reserve changes are based on the estimated current loss ratio for each subset of coverage less any amounts paid. also, any change in estimated ultimate losses from prior accident years deemed to be necessary based on the results of our latest detailed valuation reviews, large loss analyses, or other analytical techniques, either positive or negative, is reflected in the loss reserve and incurred losses for the current quarter. differences between actual loss emergence in a given period and our expectations based on prior loss reserve estimates are used to monitor reserve adequacy between detailed valuation reviews and may also influence our judgment with respect to adjusting reserve estimates.
we conduct a comprehensive loss detailed valuation review at least annually for each product line of business in accordance with actuarial standards of practice. these standards provide that the unpaid loss estimate may be presented in a variety of ways, such as a point estimate, a range of estimates, a point estimate based on the expected value of several reasonable estimates, or a probability distribution of the unpaid loss amount. our actuarial best estimate for each product line of business represents an expected value generally considering a range of reasonably possible outcomes.
the reserve analysis for each product line of business is performed by a credentialed actuarial team in collaboration with claims, underwriting, business unit management, risk management and senior management. our actuaries consider the ongoing applicability of prior data groupings and update numerous assumptions, including the analysis and selection of loss development and loss trend factors. they also determine and select the appropriate actuarial or other methods used to estimate reserve adequacy for each business product line, and may employ multiple methods and assumptions for each product line. these data groupings, accident year weights, method selections and assumptions necessarily change over time as business mix changes, development factors mature and become more credible and loss characteristics evolve. in the course of these detailed valuation reviews an actuarial best estimate of the loss reserve is determined. the sum of these estimates for each product line of business yields an overall actuarial best estimate for that line of business.
for certain product lines, we measure sensitivities and determine explicit ranges around the actuarial best estimate using multiple methodologies and varying assumptions. where we have ranges, we use them to inform our selection of best estimates of loss reserves by major product line of business. our range of reasonable estimates is not intended to cover all possibilities or extreme values and is based on known data and facts at the time of estimation.
we consult with third party environmental litigation and engineering specialists, third party toxic tort claims professionals, third party clinical and public health specialists, third party workers' compensation claims adjusters and third party actuarial advisors to help inform our judgments, as needed.
a critical component of our detailed valuation reviews is an internal peer review of our reserving analyses and conclusions, where actuaries independent of the initial review evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions used, methods selected and weightings given to different methods.  in addition, each detailed valuation review is subjected to a review and challenge process by specialists in our enterprise risk management group.
42                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates we consider key factors in performing detailed actuarial reviews, including:
an assessment of economic conditions including inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration;
(inflation, intensity and utilization of medical services) and wage inflation trends;
underlying policy pricing, terms and conditions including attachment points and policy limits;
input from underwriters on pricing, terms, and conditions and market trends; and
actuarial and other methods for major lines of business our actuaries determine the appropriate actuarial methods and segmentation. this determination is based on a variety of factors including the nature of the losses associated with the product line of business, such as the frequency or severity of the claims. in addition to determining the actuarial methods, the actuaries determine the appropriate loss reserve groupings of data. this determination is a judgmental, dynamic process and refinements to the groupings are made every year. the changes to groupings may be driven by and may change to reflect observed or emerging patterns within and across product lines, or to differentiate different risk characteristics (for example, size of deductibles and extent of third party claims specialists used by our insureds). as an example of reserve segmentation, we write many unique subsets of professional liability, which cover different products, industry segments, and coverage structures. while for pricing or other purposes, it may be appropriate to evaluate the profitability of each subset individually, we believe it is appropriate to combine the subsets into larger groups for reserving purposes to produce a greater degree of credibility in the loss experience. this determination of data segmentation and related actuarial methods is assessed, reviewed and updated at least annually.
the actuarial methods we use most commonly include paid and incurred loss development methods, expected loss ratio methods, including "bornhuetter ferguson" and "cape cod", and frequency/severity models. loss development methods utilize the actual loss development patterns from prior accident years updated through the current year to project the reported losses to an ultimate basis for all accident years. we also use this information to update our current accident year loss selections. loss development methods are generally most appropriate for classes of business that exhibit a stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next, and for which the components of the product line have similar development characteristics. for example, property exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as casualty exposures, and primary casualty exposures would generally not be combined into the same product line as excess casualty exposures. we continually refine our loss reserving techniques and adopt further segmentations based on our analysis of differing emerging loss patterns for certain product lines. we generally use expected loss ratio methods in cases where the reported loss data lacked sufficient credibility to utilize loss development methods, such as for new product lines of business or for long-tail product lines at early stages of loss development.  frequency/severity models may be used where sufficient frequency counts are available to apply such approaches.
expected loss ratio methods rely on the application of an expected loss ratio to the earned premium for the product line of business to determine the liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses. for example, an expected loss ratio of 70 percent applied to an earned premium base of $10 million for a product line of business would generate an ultimate loss estimate of $7 million. subtracting any paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve for this product line. under the bornhuetter ferguson methods, the expected loss ratio is applied only to the expected unreported portion of the losses. for example, for a long-tail product line of business for which only 10 percent of the losses are expected to be reported at the end of the accident year, the expected loss ratio would be used to represent the 90 percent of losses still unreported. the actual reported losses at the end of the accident year would be added to determine the total ultimate loss estimate for the accident year. subtracting the reported paid losses and loss adjustment expenses would result in the indicated loss reserve. in the example above, the expected loss ratio of 70 percent would be multiplied by 90 percent. the result of 63 percent would be applied to the earned premium of $10 million resulting in an estimated unreported loss of $6.3 million. actual reported losses would be added to arrive at the total ultimate losses. if the reported losses were $1 million, the ultimate loss estimate under the bornhuetter ferguson method would be $7.3 million versus the $7 million amount under the expected loss ratio method described above. thus, the bornhuetter ferguson method gives partial credibility to the actual loss experience to date for the product line of business. loss development methods generally give full credibility to the reported loss experience to date. in the example above, loss development methods would typically indicate an ultimate loss estimate of $10 million, as the reported losses of $1 million would be estimated to reflect only 10 percent of the ultimate losses.
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates a key advantage of loss development methods is that they respond more quickly to any actual changes in loss costs for the product line of business. therefore, if loss experience is unexpectedly deteriorating or improving, the loss development method gives full credibility to the changing experience. expected loss ratio methods would be slower to respond to the change, as they would continue to give more weight to a prior expected loss ratio, until enough evidence emerged to modify the expected loss ratio to reflect the changing loss experience. on the other hand, loss development methods have the disadvantage of overreacting to changes in reported losses if the loss experience is anomalous due to the various key factors described above and the inherent volatility in some of the classes. for example, the presence or absence of large losses at the early stages of loss development could cause the loss development method to overreact to the favorable or unfavorable experience by assuming it is a fundamental shift in the development pattern. in these instances, expected loss ratio methods such as bornhuetter ferguson have the advantage of recognizing large losses without extrapolating unusual large loss activity onto the unreported portion of the losses for the accident year.
frequency/severity methods generally rely on the determination of an ultimate number of claims and an average severity for each claim for each accident year. multiplying the estimated ultimate number of claims for each accident year by the expected average severity of each claim produces the estimated ultimate loss for the accident year. frequency/severity methods generally require a sufficient volume of claims in order for the average severity to be predictable. average severity for subsequent accident years is generally determined by applying an estimated annual loss cost trend to the estimated average claim severity from prior accident years. in certain cases, a structural approach may also be used to predict the ultimate loss cost. frequency/severity methods have the advantage that ultimate claim counts can generally be estimated more quickly and accurately than can ultimate losses. thus, if the average claim severity can be accurately estimated, these methods can more quickly respond to changes in loss experience than other methods. however, for average severity to be predictable, the product line of business must consist of homogenous types of claims for which loss severity trends from one year to the next are reasonably consistent and where there are limited changes to deductible levels or limits. generally these methods work best for high frequency, low severity product lines of business such as personal auto. however, frequency and severity metrics are also used to test the reasonability of results for other product lines of business and provide indications of underlying trends in the data. in addition, ultimate claim counts can be used as an alternative exposure measure to earned premiums in the cape cod method.
structural driver analytics seek to explain the underlying drivers of frequency/severity.  a structural driver analysis of frequency/severity is particularly useful for understanding the key drivers of uncertainty in the ultimate loss cost. for example, for the excess workers' compensation product line of business, we have attempted to corroborate our judgment by considering the impact on severity of the future potential for deterioration of an injured worker's medical condition, the impact of price inflation on the various categories of medical expense and cost of living adjustments on indemnity benefits, the impact of injured worker mortality and claim specific settlement and loss mitigation strategies, etc., using the following:
•     claim by claim reviews, often facilitated by third party specialists, to determine the stability and likelihood of settling an injured worker's indemnity and medical benefits;
•     analysis of the potential for future deterioration in medical condition unlikely to be picked up by a claim file review and associated with potentially costly medical procedures (i.e., increases in both utilization and intensity of medical care) over the course of the injured worker's lifetime;
•     analysis of the cost of medical price inflation for each category of medical spend (services and devices) and for cost of living adjustments in line with statutory requirements;
•     portfolio specific mortality level and mortality improvement assumptions based on a mortality study conducted for our primary and excess workers' compensation portfolios and our opinion of future longevity trends for the open reported cases;
•     ground-up consideration of the reinsurance recoveries expected for the product line of business for reported claims with extrapolation for unreported claims; and
•     the effects of various run-off loss management strategies that have been developed by our run-off unit.
44                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates in recent years, we have expanded our analysis of structural drivers to additional product lines of business as a means of corroborating our judgments using traditional actuarial techniques. for example, we have explicitly used external estimates of future medical inflation and mortality in estimating the loss development tail for excess of deductible primary workers' compensation business. using external forecasts for items such as these can improve the accuracy and stability of our estimates.
the estimation of liability for loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental pollution losses on insurance policies written many years ago is typically subject to greater uncertainty than other types of losses. this is due to inconsistent court decisions, as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies or have expanded theories of liability. in addition, reinsurance recoverable balances relating to asbestos and environmental loss reserves are subject to greater uncertainty due to the underlying age of the claim, underlying legal issues surrounding the nature of the coverage, and determination of proper policy period. for these reasons, these balances tend to be subject to increased levels of disputes and legal collection activity when actually billed. the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures.
we continue to receive claims asserting injuries and damages from toxic waste, hazardous substances, and other environmental pollutants and alleged claims to cover the cleanup costs of hazardous waste dump sites, referred to collectively as environmental claims, and indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. the vast majority of these asbestos and environmental losses emanate from policies written in 1984 and prior years. commencing in 1985, standard policies contained absolute exclusions for pollution-related damage and asbestos. the current environmental policies that we specifically price and underwrite for environmental risks on a claims-made basis have been excluded from the analysis.
the majority of our exposures for asbestos and environmental losses are related to excess casualty coverages, not primary coverages. the litigation costs are treated in the same manner as indemnity amounts, with litigation expenses included within the limits of the liability we incur. individual significant loss reserves, where future litigation costs are reasonably determinable, are established on a case-by-case basis.
the loss cost trend assumption is not believed to be material with respect to our guaranteed cost loss reserves. this is primarily because our actuaries are generally able to use loss development projections for all but the most recent accident year's reserves, so there is limited need to rely on loss cost trend assumptions for primary workers' compensation business.
the tail factor is typically the most critical assumption, and small changes in the selected tail factor can have a material effect on our carried reserves. for example, the tail factors beyond twenty years for guaranteed cost business could vary by one and one-half percent below to two percent above those actually indicated in the 2017 loss reserve review. for excess of deductible business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that tail factors beyond twenty years could vary by four percent below to six percent above those actually indicated in the 2017 loss reserve review.

u.s. excess                                            we utilize various casualty                                               loss cost trend assumptions for different segments of the portfolio. after evaluating the historical loss cost trends from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss cost trends applicable to the year-end 2017 loss reserve review for u.s.
excess casualty may range five percent lower or higher than this estimated loss trend. the loss cost trend assumption is critical for the u.s. excess casualty class of business due to the long-tail nature of the losses, and is applied across many accident years. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years (the expected loss ratio years) to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends that were initially relied upon in setting the loss reserves. these changes in loss trends could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.
u.s. excess casualty is a long-tail class of business and any deviation in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. mass tort claims in particular may develop over a very extended period and impact multiple accident years, so we usually select a separate pattern for them. thus, there is the potential for the loss reserves with respect to a number of accident years to be significantly affected by changes in loss development factors that were initially relied upon in setting the reserves.
1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual loss development factors could vary by an amount equivalent to a six month shift from those actually utilized in the year-end 2017 reserve review. this would impact projections both for accident years where the selections were directly based on loss development methods as well as the a priori loss ratio assumptions for accident years with selections based on bornhuetter-ferguson or cape cod methods. similar to loss cost trends, these changes in loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic conditions affecting losses.

u.s. financial                                         the loss cost lines                                                  trends for u.s. d&amp;o business vary by year and subset, but for the most recent accident years, it is assumed to have been generally close to zero.
after evaluating the historical loss cost levels from prior accident years since the early 1990s, including the potential effect of losses relating to the credit crisis, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the actual variation in loss cost levels for these subsets could vary by approximately
10 percent lower or higher on a year-over-year basis than the assumptions actually utilized in the year-end 2017 reserve review. because u.s. d&amp;o business has exhibited highly volatile loss trends from one accident year to the next, there is the possibility of an exceptionally high deviation. in our analysis, the effects of loss cost trend assumptions affect the results through the a priori loss ratio assumptions used for the bornhuetter-ferguson and cape cod methods, which impact the projections for the more recent accident years.
the selected loss development factors are also an important assumption, but are less critical than for u.s. excess casualty. because these classes are written on a claims made basis, the loss reporting and development tail is much shorter than for u.s. excess casualty. however, the high severity nature of the losses does create the potential for significant deviations in loss development patterns from one year to the next. similar to u.s. excess casualty, after evaluating the historical loss development factors from prior accident years since the early 1990s, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that actual loss development factors could change by an amount equivalent to a shift by six months from those actually utilized in the year-end 2017 reserve review.
u.s. property and                                      for short-tail lines special risks, and europe property and special risks   such as property and special risks, variance in outcomes for individual large claims or events can have a significant impact on results. these outcomes generally relate to unique characteristics of events such as catastrophes or losses with significant business interruption claims.
variance in estimates can result from unique events such as catastrophes. in addition, some subsets of this business, such as auto liability, can be impacted by changes in loss development factors and loss cost trends.

u.s. run-off long      we historically tail insurance lines   have used a combination of loss development methods and expected loss ratio methods for excess workers' compensation and other run-off segments. for environmental claims, we have utilized a variety of methods including traditional loss development approaches, claim department and other expert evaluations of the ultimate costs for certain claims and survival ratio metrics.
u.s. run-off long tail insurance lines is an extremely long-tail class of business, with a much greater than normal uncertainty as to the appropriate loss development factors for the tail of the loss development. specifically for excess workers' compensation, after evaluating the historical loss development factors for prior accident years since the 1980s as well as the development over the past several years of the ground up loss projections utilized to help select the loss development factors in the tail for this class of business, in our judgment, it is reasonably likely that the tail factor beyond 30 years could vary by 10 percent above or below that actually indicated in the 2017 loss reserve review.
other reserve          loss adjustment items                  expenses (lae) are separated into two broad categories, allocated loss adjustment expenses (alae), also referred to as legal defense and cost containment or
we determine reserves for legal expenses for each class of business by one or more actuarial or structural driver methods. for the majority of segments, legal costs are analyzed in conjunction with losses. for segments where they are separately analyzed the methods used generally include development methods comparable to those described for loss development methods. the development could be based on either the paid loss adjustment expenses or the ratio of paid loss adjustment expenses to paid losses, or both. other methods include the utilization of expected ultimate ratios of paid loss expense to paid losses, based on actual experience from prior accident years or from similar product lines of business.
the bulk of adjuster expenses are allocated and charged to individual claim files. for these expenses, we generally determine reserves based on calendar year ratios of adjuster expenses paid to losses paid for the particular product line of business. for other internal claim costs, which generally relate to specific claim department expenses that are not allocated to individual claim files such as technology costs and other broad initiatives, we look at historic and expected expenditures for these items and project these into the future.
the incidence of lae is directly related to the frequency, complexity and level of underlying claims. as a result, a key driver of variability in lae is the variability in the overall claims, particularly for long tail lines.
the following sensitivity analysis table summarizes the effect on the loss reserve position of using certain alternative loss cost trend (for accident years where we use expected loss ratio methods) or loss development factor assumptions rather than the assumptions actually used in determining our estimates in the year-end loss reserve analyses in 2017:
table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts long-duration traditional products include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and certain payout annuities for which the payment period is life-contingent, which include certain of our single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements.
for long-duration traditional business, a "lock-in" principle applies.  the assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and dac are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. the assumptions include mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns. these assumptions are typically consistent with pricing inputs. the assumptions also include margins for adverse deviation, principally for key assumptions such as mortality and interest rates used to discount cash flows, to reflect uncertainty given that actual experience might deviate from these assumptions. establishing margins at contract inception requires management judgment.  the extent of the margin for adverse deviation may vary depending on the uncertainty of the cash flows, which is affected by the volatility of the business and the extent of our experience with the product.
loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. to determine whether loss recognition exists, we determine whether a future loss is expected based on updated current assumptions.  if loss recognition exists, we recognize the loss by first reducing dac through amortization expense, and, if dac is depleted, record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense. because of the long-term nature of many of our liabilities subject to the "lock-in" principle, small changes in certain assumptions may cause large changes in the degree of reserve adequacy. in particular, changes in estimates of future invested asset returns have a large effect on the degree of reserve deficiency.
for additional information on loss recognition see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
groupings for loss recognition testing are consistent with our manner of acquiring, servicing, and measuring the profitability of the business and are applied by product groupings, including traditional life, payout annuities and long-term care insurance.  once loss recognition has been recorded for a block of business, the old assumption set is replaced and the assumption set used for the loss recognition would then be subject to the lock-in principle.  key judgments made in loss recognition testing include the following:
•     to determine investment returns used in loss recognition tests, we typically match liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable, and then project future cash flows on those assets. assets supporting insurance liabilities are primarily comprised of a diversified portfolio of high to medium quality fixed maturity securities, and may also include, to a lesser extent, alternative investments. our projections include a reasonable allowance for investment expenses and expected credit losses over the projection horizon. a critical assumption in the projection of expected investment income is the assumed net rate of investment return at which excess cash flows are to be reinvested.  for products in which asset and liability durations are matched relatively well, this is less of a consideration since interest on excess cash flows are not a significant component of future cash flows.  for the reinvestment rate assumption, anticipated future changes to the yield curves could have a large effect.  given the interest rate environment applicable at the date of our most recent loss recognition tests, we assumed a modest and gradual increase in long-term interest rates over time.
•     for mortality assumptions, key judgments include the extent of industry versus own experience to base future assumptions as well as the extent of expected mortality improvements in the future.  the latter judgment is based on a combination of historical mortality trends and advice from industry, public health and demography specialists that were consulted by aig's actuaries and published industry information.
•     for surrender rates, a key judgment involves the correlation between expected increases/decreases in interest rates and increases/decreases in surrender rates. to support this judgment, we compare crediting rates on our products to expected rates on competing products under different interest rate scenarios.
48                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates significant unrealized appreciation on investments in a low interest rate environment may cause dac to be adjusted and additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded through a charge directly to accumulated other comprehensive income ("shadow loss recognition"). these charges are included, net of tax, with the change in net unrealized appreciation of investments. in applying shadow loss recognition, the company overlays unrealized gains onto loss recognition tests without revising the underlying test.  accordingly, there is limited additional judgment in this process.
for additional information on shadow loss recognition see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products variable annuity products offered by our individual retirement and group retirement product lines offer guaranteed benefit features. these guaranteed features include guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb) that are payable in the event of death or other instances, and living benefits that are payable in the event of annuitization, or, in other instances, at specified dates during the accumulation period. living benefits primarily include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (gmwb).
for additional information on these features see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
the liability for gmdb, which is recorded in future policyholder benefits, represents the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account value, with the excess recognized ratably through policyholder benefits and losses incurred over the accumulation period based on total expected fee assessments. the liabilities for gmwb, which are recorded in policyholder contract deposits, are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value of the liabilities recorded in other realized capital gains (losses).
our exposure to the guaranteed amounts is equal to the amount by which the contract holder's account balance is below the amount provided by the guaranteed feature. a variable annuity contract may include more than one type of guaranteed benefit feature; for example, it may have both a gmdb and a gmwb. however, a policyholder can generally only receive payout from one guaranteed feature on a contract containing a death benefit and a living benefit, i.e., the features are generally mutually exclusive (except a surviving spouse who has a rider to potentially collect both a gmdb upon their spouse's death and a gmwb during his or her lifetime).  a policyholder cannot purchase more than one living benefit on one contract. declines in the equity markets, increased volatility and a sustained low interest rate environment increase our exposure to potential benefits under the guaranteed features, leading to an increase in the liabilities for those benefits.
for sensitivity analysis which includes the sensitivity of reserves for guaranteed benefit features to changes in the assumptions for interest rates, equity market returns, volatility, and mortality see estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products below.

table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates the reserving methodology and assumptions used to measure the liabilities of our two largest guaranteed benefit features are presented in the following table:

mortality rates, which are based upon actual experience modified to allow for variations in policy form
investment returns, using assumptions from a randomly generated model in applying asset growth assumptions for the valuation of the gmdb liability, we use a reversion to the mean methodology, similar to that applied for dac. for a description of this methodology see estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products below.
gmwb                                                                            gmwb living benefits are embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the host contract and carried at fair value. for additional information on how we reserve for variable annuity products with guaranteed benefit features see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, and for information on fair value measurement of these embedded derivatives, including how we incorporate our own non-performance risk see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
the fair value of the embedded derivatives is based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts. key assumptions include:
equity market returns
market volatility
credit spreads
equity / interest rate correlation
policyholder behavior, including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization. estimates of future policyholder behavior are subjective and based primarily on our historical experience
in applying asset growth assumptions for the valuation of gmwbs, we use market-consistent assumptions calibrated to observable interest rate and equity option prices
allocation of fees between the embedded derivative and host contract estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products policy acquisition costs and policy issuance costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts related to universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are generally deferred and amortized, with interest, in relation to the incidence of estimated gross profits to be realized over the expected lives of the contracts, except in instances where significant negative gross profits are expected in one or more periods. estimated gross profits include net investment income and spreads, net realized capital gains and losses, fees, surrender charges, expenses, and mortality gains and losses. in estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on dac amortization. for fixed deferred annuity contracts, the future spread between investment income and interest credited to policyholders is a significant judgment, particularly in a low interest rate environment.
if the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, dac and related reserves, including voba, sia, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserve (urr), are recalculated using the new assumptions, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. updating such assumptions may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.
in estimating future gross profits for variable annuity products as of december 31, 2017, a long-term annual asset growth assumption of 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) was applied to estimate the future growth in assets and related asset-based fees.  in determining the asset growth rate, the effect of short-term fluctuations in the equity markets is partially mitigated through the use of a reversion to the mean methodology, whereby short-term asset growth above or below the long-term annual rate assumption impacts the growth assumption applied to the five-year period subsequent to the current balance sheet date. the reversion to the mean methodology allows us to maintain our long-term growth assumptions, while also giving consideration to the effect of actual investment performance.  when actual performance significantly deviates from the annual

the analysis of dac, embedded derivatives and other reserves related to guaranteed benefits, and unearned revenue reserve is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described above. we estimate each of the above factors individually, without the effect of any correlation among the key assumptions. an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results. the effects on pre-tax income in the sensitivity analysis table above do not reflect the related effects from our economic hedging program, which utilizes derivative and other financial instruments and is designed so that changes in value of those instruments move in the opposite direction of changes in the guaranteed benefit embedded derivative liabilities.

table of contents item 7 | critical accounting estimates reinsurance assets the estimation of reinsurance recoverable involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature.  reinsurance assets include reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses that are estimated as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves.
we assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances through either detailed reviews of the underlying nature of the reinsurance balance or comparisons with historical trends of disputes and credit events.  we record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for uncollectable reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance assets on the balance sheet. this estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:

impairment charges impairments of investments at each balance sheet date, we evaluate our available for sale securities holdings with unrealized losses to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred.  we also evaluate our other invested assets for impairment; these include equity and cost method investments in private equity funds, hedge funds and other entities as well as investments in life settlements, aircraft and real estate.
for additional information on the methodology and significant inputs, by investment type, that we use to determine the amount of impairment see the discussion in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill impairment for a discussion of goodwill impairment see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. in 2017, 2016 and 2015, for substantially all of the reporting units we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. to determine fair value, we primarily use a discounted expected future cash flow analysis that estimates and discounts projected future distributable earnings.  such analysis is principally based on our business projections that inherently include judgments regarding business trends.
liability for legal contingencies we estimate and record a liability for potential losses that may arise from regulatory and government investigations and actions and litigation and other forms of dispute resolution to the extent such losses are probable and can be estimated. determining a reasonable estimate of the amount of such losses requires significant management judgment. in many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution. in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases that are in the early stages of litigation or in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we often cannot predict the outcome or estimate the eventual loss or range of reasonably possible losses related to such matters. given the inherent unpredictability of such matters, the outcome of certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

level 3 fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable. we consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when valuing the asset or liability. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.
we classify fair value measurements for certain assets and liabilities as level 3 when they require significant unobservable inputs in their valuation, including contractual terms, prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, default rates, mortality rates and correlations of such inputs.

income taxes recoverability of net deferred tax asset the evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. the more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.
we consider a number of factors to reliably estimate future taxable income so we can determine the extent of our ability to realize net operating losses (nols), foreign tax credits (ftcs), realized capital loss and other carryforwards. these factors include forecasts of future income for each of our businesses and actual and planned business and operational changes, both of which include assumptions about future macroeconomic and aig specific conditions and events. we subject the forecasts to stresses of key assumptions and evaluate the effect on tax attribute utilization. we also apply stresses to our assumptions about the effectiveness of relevant prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. our income forecasts, coupled with our tax planning strategies, all resulted in sufficient taxable income to achieve realization of the u.s. tax attributes prior to their expiration.

uncertain tax positions our accounting for income taxes, including uncertain tax positions, represents management's best estimate of various events and transactions, and requires judgment.  fasb interpretation no. 48, "accounting for uncertainty in income taxes" (fin 48) now incorporated into accounting standards codification, 740, income taxes (asc 740) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties and additional disclosures. we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, based on technical merits, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recognized in the financial statements. a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
u.s. tax reform on december 22, 2017, the u.s. enacted public law 115-97, known informally as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act).  the tax act reduces the statutory rate of u.s. federal corporate income tax to 21 percent and enacts numerous other changes impacting aig and the insurance industry.  additionally, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin 118 (sab 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the tax act. sab 118 addresses situations where accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act under asc 740 may be incomplete upon issuance of an entity's financial statements and provides a one-year measurement period from the enactment date to complete the accounting under asc 740. as of december 31, 2017, we had not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act.  our provision for income taxes for the periods ended december 31, 2017, is based in part on a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances and of certain provisions of the tax act.

impact of changes in the interest rate environment interest rates have remained at historically low levels throughout 2017. certain markets in which we operate have experienced negative interest rates. a sustained low interest rate environment negatively affects sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and may negatively impact the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. we actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products and economic hedging of interest rate risk from guarantee features in our variable and fixed index annuities.
table of contents item 7 | executive summary annuity sales and surrenders the sustained low interest rate environment has a significant impact on the annuity industry. low long-term interest rates put pressure on investment returns, which may negatively affect sales of interest rate sensitive products and reduce future profits on certain existing fixed rate products.  however, our disciplined rate setting has helped to mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. as long as the low interest rate environment continues, conditions will be challenging for the fixed annuity market. rapidly rising interest rates could create the potential for increased sales, but may also drive higher surrenders. customers are, however, currently buying fixed annuities with surrender charge periods of four to seven years in pursuit of higher returns, which may help mitigate the rate of increase in surrenders in a rapidly rising rate environment. in addition, older contracts that have higher minimum interest rates and continue to be attractive to the contract holders have driven better than expected persistency in fixed annuities, although the reserves for such contracts have continued to decrease over time in amount and as a percentage of the total annuity portfolio.  we will closely monitor surrenders of fixed annuities as contracts with lower minimum interest rates come out of the surrender charge period in a more attractive rate environment. low interest rates have also driven growth in our fixed index annuity products, which provide additional interest crediting tied to favorable performance in certain equity market indices and the availability of guaranteed living benefits. changes in interest rates significantly impact the valuation of our liabilities for guaranteed products with income features and the value of the related hedging portfolio.
reinvestment and spread management we actively monitor fixed income markets, including the level of interest rates, credit spreads and the shape of the yield curve. we also frequently review our interest rate assumptions and actively manage the crediting rates used for new and in-force business. business strategies continue to evolve to maintain profitability of the overall business in a historically low interest rate environment. the low interest rate environment makes it more difficult to profitably price many of our products and puts margin pressure on existing products, due to the challenge of investing recurring premiums and deposits and reinvesting investment portfolio cash flows in the low interest rate environment while maintaining satisfactory investment quality and liquidity. in addition, there is investment risk associated with future premium receipts from certain in‐force business. specifically, the investment of these future premium receipts may be at a yield below that required to meet future policy liabilities.
the contractual provisions for renewal of crediting rates and guaranteed minimum crediting rates included in products may reduce spreads in a sustained low interest rate environment and thus reduce future profitability. although this interest rate risk is partially mitigated through the asset‐liability management process, product design elements and crediting rate strategies, a sustained low interest rate environment may negatively affect future profitability.
for additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies see investments.
for investment-oriented products in our individual retirement, group retirement, life insurance and institutional markets businesses, our spread management strategies include disciplined pricing and product design for new business, modifying or limiting the sale of products that do not achieve targeted spreads, using asset-liability management to match assets to liabilities to the extent practicable, and actively managing crediting rates to help mitigate some of the pressure on investment spreads. renewal crediting rate management is done under contractual provisions that were designed to allow crediting rates to be reset at pre-established intervals in accordance with state and federal laws and subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees. we will continue to adjust crediting rates on in-force business to mitigate the pressure on spreads from declining base yields, but our ability to lower crediting rates may be limited by the competitive environment, contractual minimum crediting rates, and provisions that allow rates to be reset only at pre-established intervals.
of the aggregate fixed account values of our individual retirement and group retirement annuity products, 73 percent were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at december 31, 2017. the percentage of fixed account values of our annuity products that are currently crediting at rates above one percent was 69 percent and 70 percent at december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. these businesses continue to focus on pricing discipline and strategies to reduce the minimum guaranteed interest crediting rates offered on new sales. in the core universal life business in our life insurance business, 71 percent of the account values were crediting at the contractual minimum guaranteed interest rate at december 31, 2017.

assumption updates and loss recognition spreads and surrender rates are important components of the future profit assumptions that drive the rate we use to amortize dac and related reserves for investment-oriented products. if future profit assumptions change significantly, we may be required to recalculate dac and related reserves, and reflect any resulting adjustments in current period income. in addition to investment-oriented products, certain traditional long-duration products for which we do not have the ability to adjust interest rates, such as payout annuities, are exposed to reduced earnings and potential loss recognition reserve increases in a sustained low interest rate environment.
for discussion of such adjustments recorded in our life and retirement and legacy life and retirement run-off lines see insurance reserves - life and annuity reserves and dac - update of actuarial assumptions.
general insurance the impact of low interest rates on our general insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail casualty line of business. we expect limited impacts on our existing long-tail casualty business as the duration of our assets is slightly longer than that of our liabilities. we do expect sustained low interest rates will impact new and renewal business for the long-tail casualty line as we may not be able to adjust our future pricing consistent with our profitability objectives to fully offset the impact of investing at lower rates. however, we will continue to maintain pricing discipline and risk selection.
in addition, for our general insurance segment and general insurance run-off lines reported within the legacy portfolio, sustained low interest rates may unfavorably affect the net loss reserve discount for workers' compensation, and to a lesser extent could favorably impact assumptions about future medical costs, the combined net effect of which could result in higher net loss reserves.
table of contents item 7 | executive summary additionally, sustained low interest rates on discounting of projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans may result in higher pension expense.
department of labor fiduciary rule and related regulatory developments our individual retirement and group retirement operating segments provide products and services that are subject to restrictions imposed by the erisa and the internal revenue code, including the requirements of the dol fiduciary rule, related exemption amendments, and subsequent interpretative guidance and bulletins. overall, the dol fiduciary rule, as currently promulgated, would result in increased compliance costs and may create increased exposure to legal claims under certain circumstances, including class actions. following the extension of the applicability dates of the dol fiduciary rule and related exemptions announced by the dol in april 2017, the new definition of fiduciary and the impartial conduct standards under the dol fiduciary rule became applicable on june 9, 2017, with the remaining provisions of the rule scheduled to become applicable on january 1, 2018. on november 29, 2017, the dol finalized an 18-month delay of the elements of the rule that have not yet taken effect.
uncertainty in the annuity market around the implementation of the dol fiduciary rule has negatively impacted industry sales of annuity products, including those offered by individual retirement as reflected in declines of premiums and deposits and net flows in our variable annuity product line during the 12-month period ended december 31, 2017.  despite these effects, we believe our diverse complement of annuity product offerings position individual retirement and group retirement to effectively compete in this evolving retirement market environment.
in addition to the dol reexamining the fiduciary rule, the securities and exchange commission and state insurance regulators are also engaged in efforts to evaluate standards of conduct for investment advice, and to impose fiduciary duties on financial advisers who give investment advice.  these regulatory initiatives may also create additional uncertainties in the annuity marketplace that could affect our distribution partners and the industry sales of annuity products.  while we cannot yet predict what impact these developments will have on our businesses, we are closely following the ongoing review and assessment of the dol fiduciary rule as well as these other federal and state-level developments.
impact of currency volatility currency volatility remains acute. such volatility affected line item components of income for those businesses with substantial international operations. in particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in u.s. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. the net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected.
these currencies may continue to fluctuate, in either direction, especially as a result of the uk's announced exit from the eu, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in u.s. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability.
unless otherwise noted, references to the effects of foreign exchange in the general insurance discussion of results of operations are with respect to movements in the major currencies included in the preceding table.
other industry developments on september 7, 2017, the uk ministry of justice announced a proposal to increase the ogden rate from negative 0.75 percent to between zero and one percent. this proposal has to be passed by parliament. we will continue to monitor the progress with this potential change.

•     lower general operating and other expenses reflecting strategic actions to reduce expenses and divestitures of businesses, including united guaranty, aig advisor group, inc. (aig advisor group), fuji life and nsm;
•     a net positive adjustment from the update of life and retirement actuarial assumptions compared to a net negative adjustment in the prior year;
•     a decrease in net realized capital losses reflecting:
-   movement in the non-performance or "own credit" risk adjustment (npa), driven by tightening credit spreads and lower expected gmwb payments due to higher equity markets, and higher derivative losses from variable annuity gmwb, net of hedges, including losses from guaranteed living benefit embedded derivatives, net of hedging, primarily due to a higher net negative adjustment from updates of actuarial assumptions; and
-   gains in the prior year on the sale of a portion of our investment in people's insurance company (group) of china limited and picc property & casualty company limited (collectively, our picc investment).
the increase in pre-tax results was partially offset by lower income from divested businesses in 2017 compared to the prior year due to gains on the sales of united guaranty, aig advisor group and nsm, partially offset by losses on the agreements to sell fuji life to fwd group and certain insurance operations and assets to fairfax.
table of contents item 7 | consolidated results of operations pre-tax income (loss) comparison for 2016 and 2015
-   a net decrease of $1.4 billion related to life and retirement guaranteed living benefits, net of hedges, primarily due to movement in the npa component of the embedded derivative fair value measurement and 2016 actuarial assumption updates to surrender and mortality assumptions (see insurance reserves - life and annuity reserves and dac - variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results).
•     favorable adjustments to reserves and dac in life and retirement, including higher net positive adjustments in 2016 to reflect the update of actuarial assumptions in individual retirement and life insurance;
•     lower loss on extinguishment of debt from ongoing liability management activities; and
•     higher income from divested businesses due to gains on the sales of united guaranty, aig advisor group and nsm, partially offset by losses on the agreements to sell fuji life to fwd group and certain insurance operations and assets to fairfax.
changes specific to the insurance industry include the calculation of insurance tax reserves and related transition adjustments, amortization of specified policy acquisition expenses, treatment of separate account dividends received deductions, and computation of pro-ration adjustments.  provisions of the tax act with broader application include reductions or elimination of deductions for certain items, e.g., reductions to corporate dividends received deductions, disallowance of entertainment expenses, and limitations on the deduction of certain executive compensation costs.  these provisions, generally, will result in an increase in aig's taxable income in the years beginning after december 31, 2017.
consistent with current income tax accounting requirements, we have remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities with reference to the statutory income tax rate of 21 percent and taking into consideration other provisions of the tax act.  as of december 31, 2017, we had not fully completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act.  our provision for income taxes for the period ended december 31, 2017, is based in part on a reasonable estimate of the effects on existing deferred tax balances and of certain provisions of the tax act.  to the extent a reasonable estimate of the impact of certain provisions was determinable, we recorded provisional estimates as a component of our provision for income taxes on continuing operations.  to the extent a reasonable estimate of the impact of certain provisions was not determinable, we have not recorded any adjustments and have continued accounting for them in accordance with asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before enactment of the tax act. please refer to note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these provisions.
66                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | consolidated results of operations the tax act includes provisions for global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and for base erosion and anti-abuse tax (beat) under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to affiliated foreign companies.  consistent with accounting guidance, we will treat beat as an in period tax charge when incurred in future periods for which no deferred taxes need to be provided and have made an accounting policy election to treat gilti taxes in a similar manner.  accordingly, no provision for income taxes related to gilti or beat was recorded as of december 31, 2017.
for the period ended december 31, 2017, we recognized a provisional estimate of income tax effects of the tax act of $6.7 billion, including a tax charge of $6.7 billion attributable to the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate and tax benefit of $38 million related to the deemed repatriation tax.
in our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we made certain assumptions related to the impact of the tax act on our future taxable income.  generally, the tax act provisions result in an increase in our taxable income and, thus, accelerate utilization of our tax attribute deferred tax asset.  accordingly, we do not currently anticipate that our reliance on provisional estimates would have a material impact on our determination of the realizability of our deferred tax assets.
repatriation assumptions as a result of the tax act, the majority of accumulated foreign earnings that were previously untaxed will become subject to a one-time deemed repatriation tax. going forward, foreign earnings not taxed as part of the one-time deemed repatriation (or otherwise taxed currently under the gilti or subpart f regimes) will generally be exempt from u.s. tax upon repatriation. notwithstanding the changes, u.s. tax on foreign exchange gain or loss and certain non-u.s. withholding taxes will continue to be applicable upon future repatriations of foreign earnings.  for the year ended december 31, 2017, we consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in canada, south africa, the far east, latin america, bermuda as well as the european, asia pacific and middle east regions to be indefinitely reinvested.  these earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active business operations. deferred taxes have been provided on earnings of non-u.s. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested.
impact of deemed repatriation tax on liquidity the tax act requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax, net of tax credits related to applicable foreign taxes paid, on previously untaxed current and accumulated earnings and profits (e&p) of certain of our foreign subsidiaries.  in the determination of the deemed repatriation tax, we reviewed estimated post-1986 e&p of the relevant foreign subsidiaries, and any related non-u.s. income tax paid on such earnings. based on this analysis, we were able to determine a reasonable estimate and we have recorded a provisional estimated tax benefit of $38 million.  this amount is not considered to be material to our liquidity and capital resources.
impact to effective tax rate on future consolidated results of operations we currently estimate that effective tax rate on future consolidated results of operations would be 21-22 percent, excluding impact of the items that cannot be forecasted.  the effective tax rate is anticipated to exceed the u.s. statutory income tax rate primarily because we have operations in jurisdictions where statutory income tax rates exceed 21 percent.
-   $6.7 billion associated with the enactment of the tax act discussed above,
-   $660 million of tax charges and related interest associated with increases in uncertain tax positions primarily related to cross border financing transactions and other open tax issues,
-   $69 million associated with the effect of foreign operations, and
•     partially offset by tax benefits of:
-   $184 million of reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities, and
-   $40 million of excess tax deductions related to share based compensation payments recorded through the income statement in accordance with relevant accounting literature.
table of contents item 7 | consolidated results of operations the effect of foreign operations is primarily related to losses incurred in our european operations taxed at a statutory tax rate lower than 35 percent and other foreign taxes.
-   $234 million associated with the effect of foreign operations,
-   $216 million of tax and related interest associated with increases in uncertain tax positions related to cross border financing transactions,
-   $118 million related to disposition of subsidiaries,
-   $83 million related to increases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowances associated with u.s. federal and certain foreign jurisdictions;
•     partially offset by tax benefits of:
-   $164 million associated with a portion of the u.s. life insurance companies capital loss carryforwards previously treated as expired that was restored and utilized,
-   $116 million related to the impact of an agreement reached with the internal revenue service (irs) related to certain tax issues under audit, and
-   $132 million of reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities.
the effect of foreign operations is primarily related to foreign exchange losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries related to the weakening of the british pound following the brexit vote taxed at a statutory tax rate lower than 35 percent.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was 32.3 percent. the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to tax benefits of $195 million associated with tax exempt interest income, $127 million related to reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to income from continuing operations related to the disposal of available for sale securities, $58 million associated with the effect of foreign operations, and $109 million related to the partial completion of the irs examination covering tax year 2006, partially offset by $324 million of tax charges and related interest associated with increases in uncertain tax positions related to cross border financing transactions, and $110 million related to increases in the deferred tax asset valuation allowances associated with certain foreign jurisdictions.

we serve our business and individual customers on a global basis - from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. our clients benefit from our substantial underwriting expertise.
•     over capacity in certain lines of business that creates downward market pressure on pricing;
•     tort environment volatility in certain jurisdictions and lines of business; and
•     volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes.
general insurance - north america commercial lines continues to face challenging market conditions, with excess capacity negatively impacting the rate environment and suppressing margins.  however, we continue to achieve positive rate increases across a number of lines and sub-segments as a result of our disciplined underwriting strategy and focus on risk selection. we continue to observe higher loss cost trends in casualty, in particular excess casualty. we anticipate a positive impact on market pricing for property following recent catastrophe activity, and observed progressive rate improvements throughout the fourth quarter of 2017. the more profitable segments of commercial lines remain highly competitive; however, we continue to achieve growth in several of our high margin businesses.
general insurance - international we believe our global presence provides commercial lines and personal insurance a distinct competitive advantage, as the demand for multinational cross-border coverage and services increase due to the internationalization of customers.
the commercial lines market continues to be highly competitive, with increased pressure on rates, particularly in europe and the asia pacific region, due to increased market capacity.  despite this, we are continuing to grow our most profitable segments across all regions and are maintaining market leadership in key developed markets. we are actively remediating our underperforming segments, maintaining our underwriting discipline and continuing our risk selection strategy to maintain profitability.
personal insurance focuses on individual customers, as well as group and corporate clients. although market competition within personal insurance has increased, we continue to benefit from the underwriting quality, portfolio diversity, and low volatility of the short-tailed risk in the business.  we expect our newly formed entity in japan - aig sonpo - to provide the necessary scale and platform to compete more efficiently in the japanese market.  outside of japan, personal insurance continues to invest selectively in international markets, which we believe have higher potential for sustainable profitability.

business and financial highlights the adjusted  pre-tax loss decreased in 2017 primarily due to significantly lower unfavorable prior year loss reserve development. this decrease in adjusted pre-tax loss was partially offset by higher severe losses and higher catastrophe losses due to hurricanes harvey, irma and maria, and the california wildfires during the second half of 2017. net premiums written decreased primarily due to continued underwriting actions to strengthen our portfolio and increased rate pressure.
the increase in net investment income was driven by higher income on alternative investments and gains on securities where we elected the fair value option partially offset by lower interest and dividends due to lower invested assets resulting from the first quarter 2017 funding of the adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico.

table of contents item 7 | business segment operations | life and retirement competition and challenges life and retirement operates in the highly competitive insurance and financial services industry in the u.s. and select international markets, competing against various financial services companies, including mutual funds, banks and  other  life insurance companies. competition  is  primarily  based  on  product  pricing  and  design,  distribution, financial strength, customer service and ease of doing business.
our business remains competitive due to its  long-standing  market leading  positions,  innovative  products,  distribution  relationships across multiple channels, customer-focused service and strong financial ratings.
•     a sustained low interest rate environment, which makes it difficult to profitably price new products and puts margin pressure on existing business due to lower reinvestment yields;

individual retirement increasing life expectancy and reduced expectations for traditional retirement income from defined benefit programs and fixed income securities are leading americans to seek additional financial security as they approach retirement. the strong demand for individual variable and fixed index annuities with guaranteed income features has attracted increased competition in  this product space. in  response  to  the  continued  low interest  rate environment, which  has  added pressure to profit margins, we have developed guaranteed income benefits for both variable and fixed index annuities with margins that are less sensitive  to  the  level of interest rates.
changes in the interest rate environment can have a significant impact on sales, surrender rates, investment returns, guaranteed income features, and spreads in the annuity industry.

life insurance consumers have a significant need for life insurance, whether it is used for income replacement for their surviving family, estate planning or wealth transfer. additionally, consumers use life insurance to provide living benefits in case of chronic, critical or terminal illnesses, as well as to supplement retirement income.

as life insurance ownership remains at historical lows in the united states, efforts to expand the reach and increase the affordability of life insurance are critical. the industry is investing in consumer-centric efforts to reduce traditional barriers to securing life protection by simplifying the sales and service experience. digitally enabled processes and tools provide a fast, friendly and simple path to life insurance protection.
institutional markets institutional markets serves a variety of needs for corporate clients. demand is driven by a number of factors including the macroeconomic and regulatory environment. we expect to see continued growth in the pension risk transfer market as corporate plan sponsors look to transfer asset or liability, longevity, administrative and operational risks associated with their defined benefit plans.
changes in interest rate environment can have significant impact on investment returns and net investment spread, as well as reduce the tax efficiency associated with institutional life insurance products, dampening organic growth opportunities. tax reform may lead to new opportunities in the stable value wrap market.

fixed annuities deposits increased primarily due to higher sales in the bank and broker-dealer distribution channels as a result of customers favoring the safety of fixed annuities in response to equity market volatility. net flows were negative, but improved compared to
variable and index annuities net flows were significantly lower due to a decrease in premiums and deposits, primarily due to lower sales of variable annuities, which reflected a strategic decision to scale back living benefits during the period of very low interest rates, as well as an industry-wide slowdown and uncertainty around the effect of the dol fiduciary rule.

business and financial highlights in 2017, the legacy investment portfolio executed several transactions with external parties for total consideration of approximately $2.5 billion, which included sales of our entire life settlements portfolio with a face value (death benefits) of approximately $9.8 billion, resulting in a loss on the sale of $139 million and total book value impairments of $360 million. a significant portion of the consideration received was used to pay down intercompany loans and notes with affiliated insurance companies. in addition, the legacy investment portfolio returned approximately $3.0 billion of cash proceeds to aig parent in 2017, including $191 million from the sale of an aig-sponsored fund that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016.

• during the first quarter of 2017, we funded the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with nico. the approximate $10.2 billion funding of this agreement was the primary reason for the decrease in the invested asset portfolio in 2017.
• during 2017, we reduced our hedge fund portfolio by approximately $2.4 billion as a result of redemptions consistent with our planned reduction of exposure. our hedge fund portfolio experienced above average returns in 2017 due to higher equity market performance.
• other-than-temporary impairments decreased due to lower impairments in our structured securities and corporate bond portfolios.

investment strategies investment strategies are based on considerations that include the local and general market conditions, liability duration and cash flow characteristics, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, legal investment limitations, tax optimization and diversification.
•     fixed maturity securities held by the u.s. insurance companies included in general insurance consist of a mix of instruments that meet our current risk-return, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives.
•     outside of the u.s., fixed maturity securities held by general insurance companies consist primarily of high-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate.
•     while more of a focus is placed on asset-liability management in life and retirement companies, our fundamental strategy across all of our investment portfolios is to optimize the duration characteristics of the assets within a target range based on comparable liability characteristics, to the extent practicable.
•     aig parent, included in other operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. aig parent's liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities. based upon an assessment of its immediate and longer-term funding needs, aig parent purchases publicly traded, investment-grade rated fixed maturity securities that can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements. these securities allow us to diversify sources of liquidity while reducing the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity.
table of contents item 7 | investments attribution of net investment income to operating segments net investment income is attributed to our businesses based on internal models consistent with the nature of the underlying businesses.
for general insurance - north america and international and legacy general insurance run-off lines, we estimate investable funds based primarily on loss reserves and unearned premiums. the allocation of net investment income of the general insurance companies to segments is calculated based on these estimated investable funds, consistent with the approximate duration of the liabilities and the required economic capital allocation for each segment.
for life and retirement - individual retirement, group retirement, life insurance, and institutional markets and legacy life and retirement run-off lines, net investment income is attributed based on invested assets from segregated product line portfolios held in our life and retirement companies. all invested assets of the life and retirement companies in excess of liabilities are allocated based on estimates of required economic capital allocation for each segment.
asset liability measurement for the general insurance companies, the duration of liabilities for long-tail casualty lines is greater than that of other lines. as a result, the investment strategy within the general insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus and preservation of capital, subject to liability and other business considerations.
the general insurance companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies and also invest in structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate and commercial mortgage loans. while invested assets backing reserves of the general insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate a portion of our investment activity into asset classes that offer higher yields, particularly in the domestic operations. in addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments for their risk-return attributes, as well as to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates. this asset diversification has maintained stable average yields while the overall credit ratings of our fixed maturity securities were largely unchanged. we expect to continue to pursue this investment strategy to meet the general insurance companies' liquidity, duration and credit quality objectives as well as current risk‐return and tax objectives.
in addition, the general insurance companies seek to enhance returns through selective investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio.
fixed maturity securities of the general insurance companies' domestic operations, with an average duration of 3.9 years, are currently comprised of corporate bonds, structured securities, taxable municipal bonds and government and agency bonds as well as tax-exempt securities, which provide attractive risk-adjusted after-tax returns. the majority of these high quality investments are rated a or higher based on composite ratings.
fixed maturity securities held in the general insurance companies' foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 3.6 years.
the investment strategy of the life and retirement companies is to maximize net investment income and portfolio value, subject to liquidity requirements, capital constraints, diversification requirements, asset‐liability management and available investment opportunities.
the life and retirement companies use asset‐liability management as a primary tool to monitor and manage risk in their businesses. the life and retirement companies' fundamental investment strategy is to maintain a diversified, high to medium quality portfolio of fixed maturity securities that, to the extent practicable, complements the characteristics of liabilities, including duration, which is a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. the investment portfolio of each product line is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities, and as a result, certain portfolios are shorter in duration and others are longer in duration.  an extended low interest rate environment may result in a lengthening of liability durations from initial estimates, primarily due to lower lapses, which may require us to further extend the duration of the investment portfolio.
the life and retirement companies invest primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans.
in addition, the life and retirement companies seek to enhance returns through investments in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments. although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields.  while a diversified portfolio of alternative investments remains a fundamental

fixed maturity securities of the life and retirement companies domestic operations, with an average duration of 7.3 years, are comprised primarily of taxable corporate bonds, as well as taxable municipal and government bonds, and agency and non‐agency structured securities. the majority of these investments are held in the available for sale portfolio and are rated investment grade based on its composite ratings.
fixed maturity securities held in the life and retirement companies foreign operations are of high quality, primarily rated a or higher based on composite ratings, with an average duration of 21.1 years.
naic designations of fixed maturity securities the securities valuation office (svo) of the national association of insurance companies (naic) evaluates the investments of u.s. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called 'naic designations.' in general, naic designations of '1' highest quality, or '2' high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while naic designations of '3' through '6' generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade.  the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities, including non-agency rmbs and cmbs, which are intended to enable a more precise assessment of the value of such structured securities and increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses to better determine the appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities.  these methodologies result in an improved naic designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies.  the following tables summarize the ratings distribution of u.s. insurance companies fixed maturity security portfolio by naic designation, and the distribution by composite aig credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies.

our investments in life settlements are monitored for impairment on a contract-by-contract basis quarterly. an investment in life settlements is considered impaired if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the expected proceeds would not be sufficient to recover our estimated future carrying amount. this amount is defined as the current carrying amount for the investment in life settlements plus anticipated undiscounted future premiums and other capitalizable future costs, if any. impaired investments in life settlements are written down to their estimated fair value. this is determined on a discounted cash flow basis, incorporating current market mortality assumptions and market yields or by repricing to the anticipated sale price as appropriate.
impairments on life settlements in 2017 were mainly attributable to write-downs of the policies to the purchase price as agreed in the sale of the remainder of the life settlements portfolio.
impairments on life settlements in 2015 were partially attributable to an increase in policy premiums required to keep policies in force which resulted in lower future expected net cash flows that were insufficient to recover our net investment on certain policies as well as our adoption of the society of actuaries 2015 valuation basic table (vbt) as the market mortality assumption used to measure the fair value of impaired policies.

the change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in 2016 was primarily attributable to increases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. for 2016, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $0.9 billion due primarily to a narrowing of credit spreads, which more than offset the rise in rates.

net realized capital losses decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to foreign exchange gains versus losses in the prior year and lower other-than-temporary impairments. net realized capital losses in 2017 consisted  primarily of variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of related hedges, and impairments, which were partially offset by gains on the sales of securities and foreign exchange gains.
variable annuity embedded derivatives, net of related hedge losses were primarily a result of the non-performance or "own credit" risk adjustment used in the valuation of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (gmwb) embedded derivative impacted by interest rates and equity market performance in 2017 and changes in actuarial assumptions in our variable annuity program, both of which are not hedged as part of our economic hedging program.

net realized capital losses in 2016 were primarily related to foreign exchange losses, derivative losses, and impairments, which were higher than the gain recognized on the sale of a portion of our picc investment. foreign exchange gains (losses) were primarily due to $910 million of remeasurement losses in 2016 for a short term intercompany balance that was matched with available for sale investments in fixed maturity securities denominated in the same foreign currencies. unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale investments were recorded in other comprehensive income resulting in an immaterial impact on our overall equity or book value per share from this arrangement.
net realized capital gains in 2015 were primarily driven by foreign exchange gains which included $243 million of gains in 2015, related to the intercompany notional cash pooling arrangement, discussed above and net gains on the sales of various securities such as the class b shares of prudential financial, inc., common shares of onemain holdings and sales of our picc investment. these realized gains were partially offset by realized losses related to the sale of ordinary shares of aercap.

•     unfavorable development in u.s. excess casualty and u.s. other casualty, driven primarily by increases in underlying severity and greater than expected emerging loss experience in accident year 2016 as well as increased development from claims related to construction defects and construction wrap business (largely from accident years 2006 and prior).
•     unfavorable development in u.s. financial lines, primarily from directors & officers (d&o) policies covering privately owned and not-for-profit insureds. this development was predominantly in accident year 2016 and resulted largely from increases in bankruptcy-related claims and fiduciary liability claims for large educational institutions.
•     higher than expected losses for europe casualty and financial lines, including a significant increase in large claims activity in our europe long-tail business, with a large proportion emanating from accident year 2016. in addition, we increased our loss reserves as a result of the decision made by the uk ministry of justice to reduce the discount rate applied to lump-sum bodily injury payouts, known as the ogden rate.
•     in addition, we also observed higher than expected losses in our europe property and special risks business driven by unexpected development on various large claims across the property, aviation, marine, and trade credit segments.

for accident year 2016, the unfavorable development of $820 million was spread across multiple segments, with the drivers being u.s. excess casualty, u.s. financial lines, europe casualty and financial lines, and europe property and special risks. as noted above, we have seen unexpected loss severity in these portfolios at this early stage of development.
for accident years 2015 and prior, the unfavorable development of $158 million was primarily driven by europe casualty and financial lines. for north america, development was favorable, primarily reflecting the benefit of the prior year development ceded to nico and the amortization on the adverse development reinsurance agreement.
•     higher than expected losses emerging across several casualty product lines, especially in recent accident years (generally, 2011 to 2015) driven by increased frequency and severity of claims. this recent accident year loss emergence caused us to increase loss development factors applied across many accident years.
•     increases in loss trend assumptions to reflect the latest observed increases in frequency and severity and the impact of these increased loss trends on expected loss ratios.
•     changes in weights we apply to the various actuarial methods to better align with updated trends.
•     updated loss development selections in u.s. excess casualty, u.s. financial lines and u.s. run-off casualty insurance lines, most notably tail factor selections and incorporation of updated industry experience for asbestos liabilities.

significant reinsurance agreements effective january 1, 2016, we entered into a two-year reinsurance arrangement with the swiss reinsurance company ltd, under which we ceded a proportional share of our new and renewal u.s. primary casualty portfolio in order to reduce the concentration of casualty business in our portfolio.  this agreement was not renewed for new and renewal business for 2018 but remains in effect for risks attaching during the two-year term of the agreement.
in 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico, a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway inc., under which we transferred to nico 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our u.s. commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. under this agreement, we ceded to nico 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after january 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion.  at nico's 80 percent share, nico's limit of liability under the contract is $20 billion. the covered losses ceded to nico were $13.1 billion and the unexpired limit was $6.9 billion at december 31, 2017. we account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. we paid total consideration, including interest, of $10.2 billion. the consideration was placed into a collateral trust account as security for nico's claim payment obligations, and berkshire hathaway inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure the obligations of nico under the agreement. this transaction resulted in a gain, which under u.s. gaap retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period.

the lines of business subject to this agreement have been the source of the majority of the prior year adverse development charges over the past several years. the agreement is expected to result in lower capital charges for reserve risks at our u.s. insurance subsidiaries. in addition, we would expect future net investment income to decline as a result of lower invested assets.

life and annuity reserves and dac the following section provides discussion of life and annuity reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs.
update of actuarial assumptions the life and retirement companies review and update estimated gross profit projections used to amortize dac and related items for investment-oriented products at least annually. estimated gross profit projections include assumptions for investment-related returns and spreads, product-related fees and expenses, mortality gains and losses, policyholder behavior and other factors. in estimating future gross profits, lapse assumptions require judgment and can have a material impact on dac amortization. if the assumptions used for estimated gross profits change significantly, dac and related reserves (which may include voba, sia, guaranteed benefit reserves and unearned revenue reserves) are recalculated using the new projections, and any resulting adjustment is included in income. updating such projections may result in acceleration of amortization in some products and deceleration of amortization in other products.
the life and retirement companies also review assumptions related to the valuation of variable annuity gmwb living benefits which are accounted for as embedded derivatives and measured at fair value.  the fair value of these embedded derivatives is based on actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, as well as capital market assumptions.
•     we reduced our separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption related to equity market performance by 50 basis points to 7.0 percent and increased our reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) to 3.74 percent for the variable annuity product line in individual retirement and 3.78 percent for the variable annuity product line in group retirement; and
•     we lowered our ultimate projected yields on invested assets by approximately five to 10 basis points. projected yields are graded from a weighted average net gaap book yield of existing assets supporting the business based on the value of the asset to a weighted average yield based on the duration of the assets excluding assets that mature during the grading period. the grading period is three years for annuity products and five years for life insurance products.
table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves for long-duration traditional products, which include whole life insurance, term life insurance, accident and health insurance, long-term care insurance, and life-contingent single premium immediate annuities and structured settlements, a "lock-in" principle applies. the assumptions used to calculate the benefit liabilities and dac are set when a policy is issued and do not change with changes in actual experience, unless a loss recognition event occurs. loss recognition occurs if observed changes in actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses under loss recognition testing. underlying assumptions are reviewed periodically and updated as appropriate.

in 2017, adjusted pre-tax income included a net positive adjustment of $270 million, primarily driven by lower lapse assumptions in fixed annuities, improved mortality assumptions in life insurance, and an increase in the reversion to the mean rates in variable annuities. the positive adjustments were partially offset by lower spread assumptions in fixed annuities and a loss recognition expense on long-term care business in the legacy life and retirement run-off lines.
in 2016, adjusted pre-tax income included a net negative adjustment of $384 million, primarily driven by $622 million of loss recognition reserves for pre-2010 payout annuities in the legacy portfolio, and an increase in life insurance reserves for universal life with secondary guarantees. these negative adjustments were partially offset by positive adjustments, primarily due to lower lapse assumptions in fixed annuities.
in 2015, adjusted pre-tax income included a net negative adjustment of $6 million, primarily driven by a net negative adjustment of $118 million in life insurance, which was offset in large part by net positive adjustments of $92 million in fixed annuities and $48 million in group retirement.

in fixed annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $130 million in 2017, which reflected lower lapse assumptions, partially offset by lower spread assumptions. in 2016, a net positive adjustment of $330 million reflected lower lapse assumptions, primarily due to lower long-term interest rates, as well as updates to spread assumptions. in 2015, a net positive adjustment of $92 million reflected refinements to investment spread assumptions, lower terminations and decreases to expense assumptions.
in variable and index annuities, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $112 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in the reversion to the mean rate used for projecting future estimated gross profit for variable annuity products and changes in volatility assumptions. the net positive adjustment was partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) and a negative adjustment in connection with the conversion to a new modeling platform for index annuities.
in 2016, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $39 million in variable and index annuities primarily due to favorable updates to assumptions for volatility, lapses, mortality and policy expenses, partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). the net positive adjustment included a net negative adjustment of approximately $24 million in connection with the conversion to a new modeling platform for variable annuities, primarily due to refinements to assumptions for guaranteed minimum interest rates and investment fees, partially offset by the impact of other refinements identified during the conversion.
in 2015, there were offsetting updates to assumed investment fees, modeled expenses, and terminations, resulting in no net adjustment to adjusted pre-tax income in variable and index annuities.
group retirement in group retirement, the update of estimated gross profit assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $13 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in the reversion to the mean rate used for projecting future estimated gross profit for variable annuity products and changes in maintenance expense assumptions. the net positive adjustment was partially offset by a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected) and decreases in fixed annuity spread and separate account fee assumptions. in 2016, a net negative adjustment of $47 million was primarily due to refinements in lapse and partial withdrawal assumptions and a decrease in the separate account long-term asset growth rate assumption from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). in 2015, a net positive adjustment of $48 million was primarily due to revisions to mortality and lapse assumptions, partially offset by decreased spread assumptions.
life insurance in life insurance, the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net positive adjustment of $29 million in 2017, primarily due to improved mortality assumptions, partially offset by lower spread assumptions. in 2016, a net negative adjustment of $92 million was primarily due to refinement to reserves for universal life insurance with secondary guarantees due to lower assumed lapse rates. the update to life insurance assumptions in 2016 also included lower spread assumptions. in 2015, the net negative adjustment of $118 million was primarily due to lower assumed lapse rates for certain later-duration universal life with secondary guarantees. the net negative adjustment also reflected lower investment spread assumptions, partially offset by more favorable than expected mortality.
legacy portfolio in 2017, the update of actuarial assumptions resulted in a net negative adjustment of $14 million, primarily due to $13 million of loss recognition expense on long-term care business in the legacy life and retirement run-off lines resulting from model enhancements. in 2016, legacy life and retirement run-off lines recorded $622 million of loss recognition expense on payout annuities. the loss recognition reflected the establishment of additional reserves primarily as a result of mortality experience studies, which indicated increased longevity, particularly on disabled lives on a block of structured settlements underwritten prior to 2010. in 2015, legacy life and retirement run-off lines recorded loss recognition expense of $28 million to increase reserves for certain long-term care business. the loss recognition was primarily a result of lower future premium increase assumptions.
table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results our individual retirement and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with gmwb riders that provide guaranteed living benefit features. the liabilities for gmwb are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value. the fair value of the embedded derivatives may fluctuate significantly based on market interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, policyholder behavior and other factors.
in addition to risk-mitigating features in our variable annuity product design, we have an economic hedging program designed to manage market risk from gmwb, including exposures to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. the hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap and swaption contracts, as well as fixed maturity securities with a fair value election.
for additional discussion of market risk management related to these product features see enterprise risk management - insurance risks - life and retirement companies key risks - variable annuity risk management and hedging programs.
differences in valuation of embedded derivatives and economic hedge target the variable annuity hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents an estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders. the economic hedge target differs from the u.s. gaap valuation of the gmwb embedded derivatives primarily due to the following:
•     the economic hedge target includes 100 percent of rider fees in present value calculations; the u.s. gaap valuation reflects only those fees attributed to the embedded derivative such that the initial value at contract issue equals zero;
•     the economic hedge target uses best estimate actuarial assumptions and excludes explicit risk margins used for u.s. gaap valuation, such as margins for policyholder behavior, mortality, and volatility; and
•     the economic hedge target excludes the non-performance or "own credit" risk adjustment used in the u.s. gaap valuation, which reflects a market participant's view of our claims-paying ability by incorporating an additional spread (the npa spread) to the swap curve used to discount projected benefit cash flows. because the discount rate includes the npa spread and other explicit risk margins, the u.s. gaap valuation is generally less sensitive to movements in interest rates and other market factors, and to changes from actuarial assumption updates, than the economic hedge target. for more information on our valuation methodology for embedded derivatives within policyholder contract deposits see note 5  to the consolidated financial statements.
the market value of the hedge portfolio compared to the economic hedge target at any point in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting. in addition to the derivatives held in conjunction with the variable annuity hedging program, the life and retirement companies have cash and invested assets available to cover future claims payable under these guarantees.  the primary sources of difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target include:
•     basis risk due to the variance between expected and actual fund returns, which may be either positive or negative;
•     realized volatility versus implied volatility;
•     risk exposures that we have elected not to explicitly or fully hedge.

the impact on our pre-tax income (loss) of the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits and related hedging results includes changes in the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivatives, and changes in the fair value of related derivative hedging instruments, both of which are recorded in other realized capital gains (losses). realized capital gains (losses), as well as net investment income from changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities used in the hedging program, are excluded from adjusted pre-tax income of individual retirement and group retirement.
the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and the change in the value of the hedging portfolio are not expected to be fully offsetting, primarily due to the differences in valuation between the economic hedge target, the u.s. gaap embedded derivatives and the fair value of the hedging portfolio, as discussed above. when corporate credit spreads widen, the change in the npa spread generally reduces the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a gain, and when corporate credit spreads narrow or tighten, the change in the npa spread generally increases the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities, resulting in a loss. in addition to changes driven by credit market-related movements in the npa spread, the npa balance also reflects changes in business activity and in the net amount at risk from the underlying guaranteed living benefits.

the net impact on pre-tax income from the gmwb and related hedges in 2017 (excluding related dac amortization) was primarily driven by losses from actuarial assumption updates to lapse and volatility assumptions, tightening credit spreads on the npa spread and the impact on the npa volume of lower expected gmwb payments, driven by higher equity markets. in 2016, the net impact on pre-tax income was primarily driven by the impact of rising interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in fair value losses in the hedging portfolio, which were not offset by decreases in the embedded derivative liabilities as the risk margins and other assumptions used in the u.s. gaap valuation caused the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to market changes than the related hedge portfolio. in addition, 2016 included losses from actuarial assumption updates due to lapse and mortality assumptions. in 2015, the net impact was primarily driven by increasing npa spread and volume, which had a positive impact on pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in embedded derivative liabilities driven by a decline in interest rates and unfavorable equity market performance.
the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and npa, in 2017 was largely offset by the related hedging portfolio. however, in 2016, the change in fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and npa, reflected losses on the hedging portfolio driven by improvements in both interest rates and equity markets late in the fourth quarter of 2016, which were not offset by decreases in embedded derivative liabilities. in 2015, the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives, excluding update of actuarial assumptions and npa, included losses from equity volatility, primarily in the third quarter of 2015, a decline in interest rates and unfavorable equity market performance.
table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves fair value gains or losses in the hedging portfolio are typically not fully offset by increases or decreases in liabilities on a u.s. gaap basis, due to the npa and other risk margins used for u.s. gaap valuation that cause the embedded derivatives to be less sensitive to changes in market rates than the hedge portfolio. on an economic basis, the changes in the fair value of the hedge portfolio were partially offset by the decrease in the economic hedge target, as discussed below.
change in economic hedge target the decrease in the economic hedge target liability in 2017 was primarily due to positive equity markets, partially offset by tighter credit spreads and lower equity volatility. the increase in the economic hedge target liability in 2016 was primarily due to the update of actuarial assumptions offset by reductions from positive equity markets and increases in interest rates, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2016.
change in fair value of the hedging portfolio the changes in the fair value of the economic hedge target and, to a lesser extent, the embedded derivative valuation under u.s. gaap, were offset in part by the following changes in the fair value of the variable annuity hedging portfolio:
•     changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate bonds for which the fair value option has been elected, are used as a capital-efficient way to economically hedge interest rate and credit spread-related risk. in 2017, the change in the fair value of the corporate bond hedging program reflected gains primarily due to tightening of credit spreads. the net gains in 2016 reflected the impact of credit spreads tightening and decreases in market interest rates in the first nine months of 2016, partially offset by an increase in rates in the fourth quarter of 2016. the net losses in 2015 reflected increases in market interest rates in the first six months of 2015 and credit spreads widening. the change in the fair value of the hedging bonds, which is excluded from the adjusted pre-tax income of the individual retirement and group retirement segments, is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of income (loss).
•     the change in the fair value of equity derivative contracts, which included futures and options, resulted in losses in 2017, 2016 and 2015, which varied based on the relative growth in equity market returns in the respective years.
dac the following table summarizes the major components of the changes in dac, including voba, within the life and retirement companies, excluding dac of legacy portfolio:
year acquisition costs                                               970         1,026         1,205

the net adjustments to dac amortization from the update of actuarial assumptions for estimated gross profits, including those reported within change in dac related to net realized capital gains (losses), represented two percent, four percent and one percent of the dac balance excluding the amount related to unrealized depreciation (appreciation) of investments as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
124                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | insurance reserves reversion to the mean in 2017, we updated the long-term annual growth assumption applied to subsequent periods used in our reversion to the mean methodology for estimating future estimated gross profits for variable annuity products, from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent (before expenses that reduce the asset base from which future fees are projected). the five-year reversion to the mean period has met the criteria for adjustment in 2017. as a result, the average gross long-term return measurement start date was reset to december 31, 2011 for individual retirement and june 30, 2013 for group retirement; the reversion to the mean rates (gross of fees) were increased to 3.74 percent in individual retirement and 3.78 percent for group retirement. sustained favorable equity market performance in excess of long-term assumptions could result in additional unlocking in the individual retirement or group retirement variable annuity product lines in the future, with a positive effect on pre-tax income in the period of the unlocking.
in 2016, the long-term annual asset growth assumption was updated from 8.5 percent to 7.5 percent. the five-year reversion to the mean period has not met the criteria for adjustment in 2016 and 2015.
for additional discussion of assumptions related to our reversion to the mean methodology see critical accounting estimates - estimated gross profits for investment-oriented products.
dac and reserves related to unrealized appreciation of investments dac and reserves for universal life and investment-type products (collectively, investment-oriented products) are adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the change in dac, unearned revenue, and benefit reserves with an offset to other comprehensive income as if securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (shadow investment-oriented adjustments). shadow investment-oriented adjustments to dac and unearned revenue generally move in the opposite direction of the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, reducing the reported dac and unearned revenue balance when market interest rates decline. conversely, shadow investment-oriented adjustments to benefit reserves generally move in the same direction as the change in unrealized appreciation of the available for sale securities portfolio, increasing reported future policy benefit liabilities balance when market interest rates decline. market interest rates decreased in 2017. as a result, the unrealized appreciation of fixed maturity securities held in the life and retirement companies that support the businesses at december 31, 2017 increased by $3.4 billion compared to december 31, 2016, which resulted in a decrease in dac and unearned revenues and an increase in future policy benefit liabilities to reflect the shadow investment-oriented adjustments.
similarly, for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities (shadow loss reserves) with an offset to other comprehensive income to be recorded. at december 31, 2017, future policy benefit liabilities increased to reflect additional shadow loss reserves.

liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations.  it is defined as cash and unencumbered assets that can be monetized in a short period of time at a reasonable cost. we manage our liquidity prudently through various risk committees, policies and procedures, and a stress testing and liquidity risk framework established by our treasury group with oversight by enterprise risk management (erm). our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both aig parent and its subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario.
see enterprise risk management - risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement and enterprise risk management - liquidity risk management below for additional information.
capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. we must comply with numerous constraints on our minimum capital positions. these constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at aig and the individual businesses and are based on internally-defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. actual capital levels are monitored on a regular basis, and using erm's stress testing methodology, we evaluate the capital impact of potential macroeconomic, financial and insurance stresses in relation to the relevant capital constraints of both aig and our insurance subsidiaries.
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events.
nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. additional collateral calls, deterioration in investment portfolios or reserve strengthening affecting statutory surplus, higher surrenders of annuities and other policies, downgrades in credit ratings, or catastrophic losses may result in significant additional cash or capital needs and loss of sources of liquidity and capital. in addition, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.
depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, paying dividends to our shareholders and share and/or warrant repurchases.

billion in tax sharing payments in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities from our insurance businesses in 2017, reflecting $1.2 billion that was reimbursed by aig parent to our insurance businesses during the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of adjustments made to prior-year tax sharing payments. the tax sharing payments may continue to be subject to adjustment in future periods.
the dividends, loan repayments and tax sharing payments from our life and retirement companies resulted from and were funded, in part, by excess statutory capital released by life insurance reinsurance transactions.

operating cash flow activities insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. the ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates and operating expenses.
interest payments totaled $1.2 billion in 2017 compared to $1.3 billion in 2016 and $1.4 billion in 2015. excluding interest payments, aig had operating cash outflows of $7.3 billion in 2017 compared to operating cash inflow of $3.7 billion and $4.2 billion in 2016 and 2015 respectively. the operating cash outflow in 2017 was primarily due to payment for the adverse development reinsurance agreement entered into with nico.

liquidity and capital resources of aig parent and subsidiaries aig parent as of december 31, 2017, aig parent had approximately $11.8 billion in liquidity sources. aig parent's liquidity sources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. fixed maturity securities primarily include u.s. government and government sponsored entity securities, u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities. aig parent actively manages its assets and liabilities in terms of products, counterparties and duration. based upon an assessment of funding needs, the liquidity sources can be readily monetized through sales or repurchase agreements or contributed as admitted assets to regulated insurance companies. aig parent liquidity is monitored through the use of various internal liquidity risk measures. aig parent's primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities.  aig parent's primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, and operating expenses.
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy our reasonably foreseeable future requirements and meet our obligations to our creditors, debt-holders and insurance company subsidiaries. we expect to access the debt markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed.
we utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic growth or acquisition opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management.
in the normal course, it is expected that a portion of the capital released by our insurance operations, by our other operations or through the utilization of aig's deferred tax assets may be available to support our business strategies, for distribution to shareholders or for liability management.
in developing plans to distribute capital, aig considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to: aig's business and strategic plans, expectations for capital generation and utilization, aig's funding capacity and capital resources in comparison to internal benchmarks, as well as rating agency expectations, regulatory standards and internal stress tests for capital.

(c)  for additional information relating to this syndicated credit facility see credit facilities below.
insurance companies we expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets. our insurance companies' liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities.
each of our material insurance companies' liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures.  the primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. the primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, benefit claims, surrenders, withdrawals, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements.
our general insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances.  large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to our affected operations. downgrades in our credit ratings could put pressure on the insurer financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, which could result in non‐renewals or cancellations by policyholders and adversely affect the subsidiary's ability to meet its own obligations. increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the financial strength ratings of our subsidiaries, as rating agency capital models may reduce the amount of available capital relative to required capital. other potential events that could cause a liquidity strain include an economic collapse of a nation or region significant to our operations, nationalization, catastrophic terrorist acts, pandemics or other events causing economic or political upheaval.
on january 20, 2017, certain of our general insurance companies entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with nico under which they transferred to nico 80 percent of reserve risk on substantially all of their u.s. commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. under this agreement, these general insurance companies ceded to nico 80 percent of the paid losses on subject business paid on or after january 1, 2016 in excess of $25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $25 billion. the total consideration paid, including interest, was $10.2 billion.
management believes that because of the size and liquidity of our life and retirement companies' investment portfolios, normal deviations from projected claim or surrender experience would not create significant liquidity risk. furthermore, our life and retirement companies' products contain certain features that mitigate surrender risk, including surrender charges. however, in times of extreme capital markets disruption, liquidity needs could outpace resources. as part of their risk management framework, our life and retirement companies continue to evaluate and, where appropriate, pursue strategies and programs to improve their liquidity position and facilitate their ability to maintain a fully invested asset portfolio.
certain of our u.s. insurance companies are members of the federal home loan banks (fhlbs) in their respective districts. borrowings from the fhlbs are used to supplement liquidity or for other uses deemed appropriate by management. our u.s. general insurance companies had outstanding borrowings from the fhlbs in an aggregate amount of approximately $190 million and $733 million at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively. the outstanding borrowings are being used primarily for interest rate risk management purposes in connection with certain reinsurance arrangements, and the related balances are expected to decline as underlying premiums are collected. our u.s. life and retirement companies had no outstanding borrowings in the form of cash advances from the fhlbs at december 31, 2017, and aggregate borrowings in the form of cash advances of approximately $2 million at december 31, 2016. in addition, $606 million and $429 million were due to the fhlb of dallas at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively, under funding agreements issued by our institutional markets business, which were reported in policyholder contract deposits.
table of contents item 7 | liquidity and capital resources certain of our u.s. life and retirement companies have programs, which began in 2012, that lend securities from their investment portfolio to supplement liquidity or for other uses as deemed appropriate by management. under these programs, these u.s. life and retirement companies lend securities to financial institutions and receive cash as collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. cash collateral received is invested in short-term investments. additionally, the aggregate amount of securities that a life and retirement company is able to lend under its program at any time is limited to five percent of its general account statutory-basis admitted assets. our u.s. life and retirement companies had $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion of securities subject to these agreements at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively, and $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion of liabilities to borrowers for collateral received at december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016, respectively.
aig generally manages capital between aig parent and our insurance companies through internal, board-approved policies and limits, as well as management standards. in addition, aig parent has unconditional capital maintenance agreements (cmas) in place with certain subsidiaries. nevertheless, regulatory and other legal restrictions could limit our ability to transfer capital freely, either to or from our subsidiaries.
aig parent and/or certain subsidiaries are parties to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions.  these financial institutions issue letters of credit from time to time to certain of our general insurance companies for insurance regulatory and reinsurance collateral purposes or for capital support, and the total outstanding amount of issued letters of credit for these purposes was approximately $3.1 billion at year end 2017. letters of credit issued in support of the life and retirement companies totaled approximately $900 million at year end 2017.
during 2016, we created a new switzerland-domiciled international holding company, aig international holdings, gmbh (aigih), which is intended to be the ultimate holding company for all of our international entities. this international holding company structure is part of our ongoing efforts to simplify our organizational structure, and is expected to facilitate the optimization of our international capital strategy from both a regulatory and tax perspective. through february 8, 2018, substantially all of our international operations have been transferred to aigih. we will continue to monitor our international holding company structure in light of regulatory, tax and other developments, to ensure that this strategy continues to be effective.
in 2017, our general insurance companies paid approximately $350 million in dividends in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities to aig parent. the fixed maturity securities primarily included u.s. government and government-sponsored entity securities, u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities.
in 2017, our life and retirement companies collectively declared a total of $2.4 billion of dividends, return of capital and loan repayments. of this amount, $1.1 billion was paid in the form of cash, $387 million was paid in the form of fixed maturity securities, and $890 million was retained at an intermediate life insurance holding company to fund tax sharing payments to aig parent. the life and retirement companies made tax sharing payments to aig parent in 2017 totaling $3.3 billion in the form of cash and fixed maturity securities, primarily as a result of the life insurance reinsurance transactions. fixed maturity securities used to fund dividends and tax sharing payments included u.s. government and government sponsored entity securities, u.s. agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate and municipal bonds and certain other highly rated securities.
credit facilities we maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility (the facility) as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. the facility provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to $4.5 billion without any limits on the type of borrowings and is scheduled to expire in june 2022.
as of december 31, 2017, a total of $4.5 billion remains available under the facility. our ability to utilize the facility is not contingent on our credit ratings. however, our ability to utilize the facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the facility. these include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the facility would restrict our access to the facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. we expect to utilize the facility from time to time, and may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

insurance and investment contract liabilities insurance and investment contract liabilities, including gic liabilities, relate to our life and retirement companies. these liabilities include various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities, including periodic payments. these liabilities also include benefit and claim liabilities, of which a significant portion represents policies and contracts that do not have stated contractual maturity dates and may not result in any future payment obligations. for these policies and contracts (i) we are not currently making payments until the occurrence of an insurable event, such as death or disability, (ii) payments are conditional on survivorship or (iii) payment may occur due to a surrender or other non-scheduled event beyond our control.
we have made significant assumptions to determine the estimated undiscounted cash flows of these contractual policy benefits. these assumptions include mortality, morbidity, future lapse rates, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates, offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force policies. due to the significance of the assumptions, the periodic amounts presented could be materially different from actual required payments. the amounts presented in this table are undiscounted and exceed the future policy benefits and policyholder contract deposits included in the consolidated balance sheets.

borrowings our borrowings exclude those incurred by consolidated investments and include hybrid financial instrument liabilities recorded at fair value. we expect to repay the long-term debt maturities and interest accrued on borrowings by aig through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt issuance and other financing arrangements. borrowings supported by assets of aig include various notes and bonds payable as well as gias that are supported by cash and investments held by aig parent and certain non-insurance subsidiaries for the repayment of those obligations.

(e)  includes a senior unsecured revolving credit facility between aercap ireland capital designated activity company (formerly aercap ireland capital limited), as borrower, and aig parent, as lender (the aercap credit facility). the aercap credit facility permits loans for general corporate purposes. in december 2017, the aggregate commitment under the aercap credit facility was reduced to $200 million from $500 million and the termination date of the facility was extended to october 2019 from may 2019. at december 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the aercap credit facility.
(f)  excludes commitments with respect to pension plans. the annual pension contribution for 2018 is expected to be approximately $64 million for u.s. and non-u.s. plans.
tax matters if the settlement agreements in principle are concluded in our ongoing dispute related to the disallowance of foreign tax credits associated with cross border financing transactions, we will be required to make a payment to the u.s. treasury. although we can provide no assurance regarding whether the non-binding settlements will be finalized, the amount we currently expect to pay based on current proposed settlement terms is approximately $1.3 billion. this amount is net of payments previously made with respect to cross border financing transactions involving matters dating back to 1997 and other matters largely related to the same tax years.  there remains uncertainty with regard to whether the settlements in principle will ultimately be approved by the relevant authorities as well as the amount and timing of any potential payments, which are not likely to be made before sometime in 2019.
for additional information regarding this matter see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
arrangements with variable interest entities we enter into various arrangements with variable interest entities (vies) in the normal course of business, and we consolidate a vie when we are the primary beneficiary of the entity.
for a further discussion of our involvement with vies see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
indemnification agreements we are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with our sales of businesses. these arrangements may be triggered by declines in asset values, specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, litigation developments, or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. these arrangements are typically subject to time limitations, defined by contract or by operation of law, such as by prevailing statutes of limitation. depending on the specific terms of the arrangements, the maximum potential obligation may or may not be subject to contractual limitations.
for additional information regarding our indemnification agreements see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
we have recorded liabilities for certain of these arrangements where it is possible to estimate them. these liabilities are not material in the aggregate. we are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under some of these arrangements. overall, we believe that it is unlikely we will have to make any material payments under these arrangements.

(c)  fitch ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.
these credit ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. ratings may also be withdrawn at our request.
we are party to some agreements that contain "ratings triggers." depending on the ratings maintained by one or more rating agencies, these triggers could result in (i) the termination or limitation of credit availability or a requirement for accelerated repayment, (ii) the termination of business contracts or (iii) a requirement to post collateral for the benefit of counterparties.
in the event of adverse actions on our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies, aigfp and certain other aig entities would be required to post additional collateral under some derivative transactions or could experience termination of the transactions. such requirements and terminations could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. in the event of a further downgrade of aig's long-term senior debt ratings, aigfp and certain other aig entities would be required to post additional collateral, and certain of the counterparties of aigfp or of such other aig entities would be permitted to terminate their contracts early.
the actual amount of collateral that we would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade.

138                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management enterprise risk management risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. we consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance.
overview we have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm‐wide risk appetite. our board of directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. our enterprise risk management (erm) department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of aig's major risk positions. within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk‐taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by erm. erm supports our businesses and management in the embedding of risk management in our key day-to-day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, monitoring, reporting, and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses. nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur.
risk governance structure our risk governance structure fosters the development and maintenance of a risk and control management culture that encompasses all significant risk categories impacting our lines of business and functions. accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit. we review our governance and committee structure on a regular basis and make changes as appropriate to continue to effectively manage and govern our risks and risk-taking.
our board of directors oversees the management of risk through its risk and capital committee (rcc) and audit committee. those committees regularly interact with other committees of the board of directors. our chief risk officer (cro) reports to both the rcc and our chief executive officer (ceo).
the group risk committee (grc):  the grc is the senior management group responsible for assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis to protect our financial strength, optimize our intrinsic value, and protect our reputation. the grc is chaired by our cro. its membership includes our ceo, chief financial officer (cfo), and other senior executives from across our corporate functions and business units. our cro reports periodically on behalf of the grc to both the rcc and the audit committee of the board of directors. our cro is also a member of the executive leadership team (elt) providing erm the opportunity to contribute to, review, monitor and consider the impact of changes in strategy.
management committees that support the grc are described below. these committees are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout aig and its subsidiaries. these committees are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates.
financial risk group (frg):  the frg is responsible for the oversight of financial risks taken by aig and our subsidiaries. its mandate includes overseeing our aggregate credit, market, interest rate, capital, liquidity and model risks, as well as asset-liability management, derivatives activity, and foreign exchange transactions. it provides the primary corporate-level review function for all proposed transactions and business practices that are significant in size, complex in scope, or that present heightened legal, reputational, accounting or regulatory risks. the frg is chaired by our cro. membership of the frg also includes our cfo, chief investment officer (cio) and treasurer.
technology, operational risk & control committee (torcc): this committee oversees technology and operational risk management and control issues and activities across our businesses, functions, and geographic locations. the torcc reviews our risk management practices and monitors current and emerging technology and operational risks, as well as management actions taken to reduce such risks to acceptable levels within our risk appetite. it primarily focuses on establishing the firm-wide framework for identifying, assessing, measuring, managing and monitoring technology and operational risks. the torcc addresses firm-wide, rather than business-specific issues and is mandated to prioritize technology and operational improvements that are significant and transformational. the torcc also provides a forum for senior management to assess our business technology and operational risk profiles that may affect our strategic objectives.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management the scope of the torcc includes, but is not limited to, operational risk management, technology risk management, model risk management, information security, compliance, sarbanes oxley, disaster recovery, project risk management and vendor risk management.
the torcc is an authorized sub-committee of our grc and supports the grc in its risk management oversight role. the torcc is co-chaired by our cro and our cio. membership of the torcc also includes owners of the control agenda (oca), business information officers, and members of the various control and assurance functions.
in addition, the torcc may form, and delegate authority to, sub-committees or working groups which oversee technology and operational risk-related matters on its behalf with periodic reporting to the torcc.
business unit risk committees: each of our major insurance businesses has established a risk committee that serves as the senior management committee responsible for risk oversight at the individual business unit level. the risk committees are responsible for the identification, assessment and monitoring of all sources of risk within their respective portfolios. specific responsibilities include setting risk tolerances, reviewing the capital allocation framework, insurance portfolio optimization, and providing oversight of risk-adjusted metrics. in addition, each business unit has established subordinate committees at the legal entity level and has working groups in place that support these committees in executing their duties, such as ensuring policies are adhered to, and transactions are completed with risk appetite in mind. together, these committees provide comprehensive risk oversight throughout the organization.
140                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement risk appetite framework our risk appetite framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals and available financial resources. we balance these by seeking to take measured risks that are expected to generate repeatable, sustainable earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. the framework includes our risk appetite statement approved by the board of directors or a committee thereof and a set of supporting tools, including risk tolerances, risk limits and policies, which we use to manage our risk profile and financial resources.
we articulate our aggregate risk-taking by setting risk tolerances and thresholds on capital and liquidity measures. these measures are set at the aig parent level as well as the legal entity level and cover consolidated and insurance company capital and liquidity ratios. we must comply with standards for capital adequacy and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all our obligations as they come due in accordance with our internal capital management and liquidity policies. our risk tolerances take into consideration regulatory requirements, rating agency expectations, and business needs. the grc routinely reviews the level of risk taken by the consolidated organization in relation to the established risk tolerances. a consolidated risk report is also presented periodically, as required, to the rcc by our cro.
risk limits a key component of our risk appetite framework is having a process in place that establishes and maintains appropriate limits on the material risks identified for our core businesses and facilitates monitoring and meeting of both internal and external stakeholder expectations. our objectives include:
•     establishing risk monitoring, providing early warning indicators, and ensuring timely oversight and enforceability of limits;
•     defining a consistent and transparent approach to limits governance; and
•     aligning our business activities with our risk appetite statement.
to support the monitoring and management of aig's and its business units' material risks, erm has an established limits framework that employs a three-tiered hierarchy:
•     board-level risk tolerances are aig's aggregate capital and liquidity limits. they define the minimum level of capital and liquidity that we should maintain. these board-level risk tolerances require rcc approval.
•     aig management level limits are risk type specific limits at the aig consolidated level. these limits are defined and calibrated to constrain our concentration in specific risk types, to protect against taking risks that exceed the amount of overall capital aig has available, and to protect against excess earnings volatility. these limits are approved by our cro with consultation from the grc.
•     bu and legal entity level limits are set to address key risks identified by erm for the business unit and legal entities, protect capital and liquidity at legal entities and/or meet legal entity specific requirements of regulators and rating agencies. these limits are defined by the business unit and legal entity risk officers.
all limits are reviewed by the frg, grc or relevant business unit risk committees on a periodic basis and revisions, if applicable, are approved by those committees.
the business units are responsible for measuring and monitoring their risk exposures. erm is responsible for monitoring compliance with limits and providing regular, timely reporting to our senior management and risk committees. limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner and are documented and escalated in accordance with their level of severity or materiality.
risk identification and measurement one tool we use to inform our risk appetite framework is risk identification. we conduct risk identification through a number of processes at the business unit and corporate level focused on capturing our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. a key initiative is our integrated bottom-up risk identification and assessment process down to the product-line level. these processes are used as a critical input to enhance and develop our analytics for measuring and assessing risks across the organization.
we employ various approaches to measure, monitor, and manage risk exposures, including the utilization of a variety of metrics and early warning indicators. we use a proprietary internal capital and stress testing framework to measure our quantifiable risks for both insurance and non-insurance operations.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management the internal capital framework quantifies our aggregate economic risk at a given confidence interval, after taking into account a level of diversification benefits between risk factors and business lines. we leverage the internal capital framework to help inform our consolidated risk consumption and profile as well as risk and capital allocation for our businesses.
the stress testing framework measures risk over multiple time horizons and under different levels of stress. we develop a range of stress scenarios based on both internal experience and regulatory guidance. the stress tests are intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available under both idiosyncratic and systemic market stress conditions.
the stress testing framework assesses our aggregate exposure to our most significant financial and insurance risks, including the risk in each of our key insurance company subsidiaries in relation to its capital needs under stress, risks inherent in our non-insurance company subsidiaries, and risks to aig consolidated capital. we use this information to determine the resources needed at the aig parent level to support our subsidiaries and capital resources required to maintain consolidated company target capitalization levels.
credit risk management     liquidity risk management     insurance risks
market risk management     operational risk management   other business risks credit risk management overview credit risk is defined as the risk that our customers or counterparties are unable or unwilling to repay their contractual obligations when they become due. credit risk may also result from a downgrade of a counterparty's credit ratings or a widening of its credit spreads.
we devote considerable resources to managing our direct and indirect credit exposures. these exposures may arise from, but are not limited to, fixed income investments, equity securities, deposits, commercial paper investments, reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements, corporate and consumer loans, leases, reinsurance recoverables, counterparty risk arising from derivatives activities, collateral extended to counterparties, insurance risk cessions to third parties, financial guarantees, letters of credit, and certain general insurance businesses.
governance our credit risks are managed by teams of credit professionals, subject to erm oversight and various control processes. their primary role is to assure appropriate credit risk management in accordance with our credit policies and procedures relative to our credit risk parameters. our chief credit officer (cco) and credit executives are primarily responsible for the development, implementation and maintenance of a risk management framework, which includes the following elements related to our credit risks:
•     developing and implementing our company-wide credit policies and procedures;
•     approving delegated credit authorities to our credit executives and qualified credit professionals;
•     developing methodologies for quantification and assessment of credit risks, including the establishment and maintenance of our internal risk rating process;
•     managing a system of credit and program limits, as well as the approval process for credit transactions, above limit exposures, and concentrations of risk that may exist or be incurred;
•     evaluating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting of credit risks and concentrations regularly with senior management; and
•     approving appropriate credit reserves, credit-related other-than-temporary impairments and corresponding methodologies for all credit portfolios.
we monitor and control our company-wide credit risk concentrations and attempt to avoid unwanted or excessive risk accumulations, whether funded or unfunded. to minimize the level of credit risk in some circumstances, we may require mitigants, such as third‐party guarantees, reinsurance or collateral, including commercial bank-issued letters of credit and trust collateral accounts. we treat these guarantees, reinsurance recoverables, and letters of credit as credit exposure and include them in our risk concentration exposure data. we also monitor closely the quality of any trust collateral accounts.

risk measurement                            comprising risk ratings, default probabilities, loss given default and expected loss parameters, exposure calculations, stress testing and other risk analytics risk limits                                 including, but not limited to, a system of single obligor or risk group-based aig-wide house limits and sub-limits for corporates, financial institutions, sovereigns and sub-sovereigns when appropriate and a defined process for identifying, evaluating, documenting and approving, if appropriate, breaches of and exceptions to such limits risk delegations                            a comprehensive credit risk delegation framework from the cco to authorized credit professionals throughout the company risk evaluation, monitoring and reporting   including the ongoing analysis and assessment of credit risks, trending of those risks and reporting of other key risk metrics and limits to the cco and senior management, as may be required credit reserving                            including but not limited to development of a proper framework, policies and procedures for establishing accurate identification of (i) allowance for loan and lease losses, and (ii) other-than-temporary impairments for securities portfolios market risk management market risk is defined as the risk of adverse impact due to systemic movements in one or more of the following market risk drivers:  equity and commodity prices, residential and commercial real estate values, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange, inflation, and their levels of volatility.
we are engaged in a variety of insurance, investment and other financial services businesses that expose us to market risk, directly and indirectly. we are exposed to market risks primarily within our insurance and capital markets activities, on both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet through on- and off-balance sheet exposures. the risk officer within each business is responsible for creating a framework to properly identify these risks, then ensuring that they are appropriately measured, monitored and managed in accordance with the risk governance framework established by the chief market risk officer (cmro).
the scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. our market risk management framework focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in these broad market observables, as opposed to the idiosyncratic risks associated with individual assets that are addressed through our credit risk management function.
many of our market risk exposures related to interest rates and equity returns are associated with our life and retirement companies and relate to both asset and liability exposures. in addition, these exposures are long-term in nature. examples of liability-related exposures include interest rate sensitive surrenders in our fixed deferred annuity product portfolio. also, we have equity market risk sensitive surrenders in our variable annuity product portfolio. these interactive asset-liability types of risk exposures are regularly monitored in accordance with the risk governance framework noted above.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management risk identification market risk focuses on quantifying the financial repercussions of changes in broad, external, predominantly market-observable risks. financial repercussions can include an adverse impact on results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital.
equity prices                         we are exposed to changes in equity market prices affecting a variety of instruments. changes in equity prices can affect the valuation of publicly traded equity shares, investments in private equity, hedge funds and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other equity-linked capital market instruments as well as equity-linked insurance products, including but not limited to index annuities, variable annuities, indexed universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance.
residential and                 our investment portfolios are exposed to the risk of commercial real estate values   changing values in a variety of residential and commercial real estate investments. changes in residential/commercial real estate prices can affect the valuation of residential/commercial mortgages, residential/commercial mortgage‐backed securities and other structured securities with underlying assets that include residential/commercial mortgages, trusts that include residential/commercial real estate and/or mortgages, residential mortgage insurance and reinsurance contracts and commercial real estate investments.
interest rates                  interest rate risk can arise from a mismatch in the interest rate exposure of assets versus liabilities. lower interest rates generally result in lower investment income and make some of our product offerings less attractive to investors. conversely, higher interest rates are typically beneficial for the opposite reasons. however, when rates rise quickly, there can be a temporary asymmetric gaap accounting effect where the existing securities lose market value, which is largely reported in other comprehensive income, and the offsetting decrease in the value of related liabilities may not be recognized. changes in interest rates can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, financial liabilities, insurance contracts including but not limited to universal life, fixed rate annuities, variable annuities and derivative contracts.
credit spreads                  credit spreads measure an instrument's risk premium or yield relative to that of a comparable duration, default‐free instrument. changes in credit spreads can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including but not limited to corporate bonds, abs, mortgage-backed securities, aig-issued debt obligations, credit derivatives and derivative credit valuation adjustments. much like higher interest rates, wider credit spreads with unchanged default losses mean more investment income in the long term. in the short term, quickly rising spreads will cause a loss in the value of existing fixed maturity securities, which is largely reported in other comprehensive income. a precipitous widening of credit spreads may also signal a fundamental weakness in the credit worthiness of bond obligors, potentially resulting in default losses.
foreign exchange                we are a globally diversified enterprise with income,
(fx) rates                      assets and liabilities denominated in, and capital deployed in, a variety of currencies. changes in fx rates can affect the valuation of a broad range of balance sheet and income statement items as well as the settlement of cash flows exchanged in specific transactions.
commodity prices                changes in commodity prices (the value of commodities) can affect the valuation of publicly‐traded commodities, commodity indices and derivatives on commodities and commodity indices. we are exposed to commodity prices primarily through their impact on the prices and credit quality of commodity producers' debt and equity securities in our investment portfolio.
inflation                       changes in inflation can affect the valuation of fixed maturity securities, including aig-issued debt obligations, derivatives and other contracts explicitly linked to inflation indices, and insurance contracts where the claims are linked to inflation either explicitly, via indexing, or implicitly, through medical costs or wage levels.

•     written policies that define the rules for our market risk-taking activities and provide clear guidance regarding their execution and management;
•     a limit framework that aligns with our board-approved risk appetite statement;
•     independent measurement, monitoring and reporting for line of business, business unit and enterprise-wide market risks; and
•     clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to market risk management.
•     these components facilitate the cmro's identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and management of our market risks.
risk measurement our market risk measurement framework was developed with the main objective of communicating the range and scale of our market risk exposures. at the firm‐wide level market risk is measured in a manner that is consistent with aig's risk appetite statement. this is designed to ensure that we remain within our stated risk tolerance levels and can determine how much additional market risk taking capacity is available within our framework. our risk appetite is currently defined in terms of capital and liquidity levels. at the market risk level, the framework measures our overall exposure to each systemic market risk change on an economic basis.
in addition, we continue to use enhanced economic, gaap accounting and statutory capital‐based risk measures at the market risk level, business‐unit level and firm‐wide levels. this process aims to ensure that we have a comprehensive view of the impact of our market risk exposures.
sensitivity analysis   measures the impact from a unit change in a market             • a one basis point increase in yield on fixed maturity risk input                                                     securities,
• a one basis point increase in credit spreads of fixed maturity securities, and
• a one percent increase in prices of equity securities.
• a 20 percent immediate and simultaneous decrease in world‐wide equity markets.

(a)  at december 31, 2017, the analysis covered $276.8 billion of $289.6 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. excluded were $8.2 billion of loans. in addition, $4.6 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations. at december 31, 2016, the analysis covered $276.1 billion of $291.7 billion interest-rate sensitive assets. excluded were $8.1 billion of loans and $2.5 billion of investments in life settlements. in addition, $5.0 billion of assets across various asset categories were excluded due to modeling limitations.
(c)  the balance sheet exposures for equity contracts and variable annuity and other embedded derivatives are also reflected under "interest rate sensitive liabilities" above, and are not additive.
(d)  the majority of the foreign currency exposure is reported on a one quarter lag.
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. we cannot ensure that our actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated above.
we use duration and convexity metrics to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes for interest rate sensitive assets excluding derivatives and long-term debt. duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates. convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates.
interest rate sensitivity of a derivative is calculated as change in its value with respect to plus a 100 basis point change in the interest rate environment, calculated as: scenario value minus base value, where base value is the value of the derivative under the yield curves as of the period end and scenario value is the value reflecting a 100 basis point parallel increase in all yield curves.
we evaluate our interest rate risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives. this scenario does not measure changes in value resulting from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve, which could produce different results.
we evaluate our equity price risk without the effect of any correlation among other key market risks or other assumptions used for calculating the fair value of our financial liabilities and embedded derivatives. this scenario considers the direct impact of declines in equity prices and not changes in asset-based fees, changes in the estimated gross profits used for amortizing dac, or changes in any other assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivatives related to the living benefit features within variable annuity products. in addition, this scenario does not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds and actual fund returns, which we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy.
foreign currency-denominated net asset position reflects our consolidated non‐u.s. dollar assets less our consolidated non‐u.s dollar liabilities on a gaap basis, with certain adjustments. we use a bottom-up approach in managing our foreign currency exchange rate exposures with the objective of protecting statutory capital at the regulated insurance entity level. at the aig parent level, we monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits.
our foreign currency-denominated net asset position at december 31, 2017, decreased by $3.3 billion compared to december 31, 2016. the decrease was primarily due to a $1.7 billion decrease in our japanese yen position primarily due to the sale of fuji life and the unwinding of certain yen hedges; a $0.7 billion decrease in our euro position primarily due to the issuance of €1.0 billion euro denominated debt; and a $248 million decrease in our british pound position primarily due to an increase in reserves.
for illustrative purposes, we modeled our sensitivities based on a 100 basis point increase in yield curves, a 20 percent decline in equities and alternative assets, and a 10 percent depreciation of all foreign currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar. the estimated results presented in the table above should not be taken as a prediction, but only as a demonstration of the potential effects of such events.
the sensitivity factors utilized for 2017 and presented above were selected based on historical data from 1997 to 2017, as follows (see the table below):
•     a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve is consistent with a one standard deviation movement of the benchmark ten-year treasury yield;
•     a 20 percent drop for equity and alternative investments is broadly consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the s&p 500; and
•     a 10 percent depreciation of foreign currency exchange rates is consistent with a one standard deviation movement in the u.s. dollar (usd)/japanese yen (jpy) exchange rate.

risk monitoring and limits the risk monitoring responsibilities, owned by the business units, include ensuring compliance with market risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. such activities must be reported to the erm market risk team by the relevant business unit. this monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.
to control our exposure to market risk, we rely on a three-tiered hierarchy of limits that the cmro closely monitors and reports to our cro, senior management and risk committees.
for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits see risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement - risk limits herein.
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is defined as the risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability or perceived inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral or other financial obligations. failure to appropriately manage liquidity risk can result in insolvency, reduced operating flexibility, increased costs, reputational harm and regulatory action.
aig and its legal entities seek to maintain sufficient liquidity both during the normal course of business and under defined liquidity stress scenarios to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet the obligations as they come due.
aig parent liquidity risk tolerance levels are designed to allow us to meet our financial obligations for a minimum of six months under a liquidity stress scenario. we maintain liquidity limits and minimum coverage ratios designed to ensure that funding needs are met under varying market conditions. if we project that we will breach these tolerances, we will assess and determine appropriate liquidity management actions. however, the market conditions in effect at that time may not permit us to achieve an increase in liquidity sources or a reduction in liquidity requirements.
risk identification the following sources of liquidity and funding risks could impact our ability to meet short-term financial obligations as they come due.
market/monetization risk                assets may not be readily transformed into cash due to unfavorable market conditions. market liquidity risk may limit our ability to sell assets at reasonable values to meet liquidity needs.
cash flow mismatch risk    discrete and cumulative cash flow mismatches or gaps over short-term horizons under both expected and adverse business conditions may create future liquidity shortfalls.
event funding risk         additional funding may be required as the result of a trigger event. event funding risk comes in many forms and may result from a downgrade in credit ratings, a market event, or some other event that creates a funding obligation or limits existing funding options.
financing risk             we may be unable to raise additional cash on a secured or unsecured basis due to unfavorable market conditions, aig-specific issues, or any other issue that impedes access to additional funding.
governance liquidity risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm. the cro has responsibility for the oversight of the liquidity risk management framework and delegates the day-to-day implementation of this framework to the aig treasurer. our corporate treasury function manages liquidity risk, subject to erm oversight and various control processes.
the liquidity risk management framework is guided by the liquidity risk tolerance as set forth in the board-approved risk appetite statement. the principal objective of this framework is to establish minimum liquidity requirements that protect our long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business, and to meet short-term financial obligations in a timely manner in both normal and stressed conditions.
148                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management our liquidity risk management framework includes a number of liquidity and funding policies and monitoring tools to address aig-specific, broader industry and market-related liquidity events.
risk measurement comprehensive cash flow projections under normal conditions are the primary component for identifying and measuring liquidity risk. we produce comprehensive liquidity projections over varying time horizons that incorporate all relevant liquidity sources and uses and include known and likely cash inflows and outflows. in addition, we perform stress testing by identifying liquidity stress scenarios and assessing the effects of these scenarios on our cash flow and liquidity.
we use a number of approaches to measure our liquidity risk exposure, including:
minimum liquidity limits              minimum liquidity limits specify the amount of assets required to be maintained in specific liquidity portfolios to meet obligations as they arise over a specified time horizon under stressed liquidity conditions.
coverage ratios            coverage ratios measure the adequacy of available liquidity sources, including the ability to monetize assets to meet the forecasted cash flows over a specified time horizon. the portfolio of assets is selected based on our ability to convert those assets into cash under the assumed market conditions and within the specified time horizon.
cash flow forecasts        cash flow forecasts measure the liquidity needed for a specific legal entity over a specified time horizon.
stress testing             asset liquidity and coverage ratios are re-measured under defined liquidity stress scenarios that will impact net cash flows, liquid assets and/or other funding sources.
relevant liquidity reporting is produced and reported regularly to aig parent and business unit risk committees. the frequency, content, and nature of reporting will vary for each business unit and legal entity, based on its complexity, risk profile, activities and size.
operational risk is inherent in each of our business units and functions and can have many impacts, including but not limited to: unexpected economic losses or gains, reputational harm due to negative publicity, regulatory action from supervisory agencies and operational and business disruptions, and/or damage to customer relationships.
governance our operational risk governance sets the requirements necessary to embed a risk management culture throughout the organization. aig and its consolidated subsidiaries establish and maintain operational risk and controls governance forums that include representatives from the relevant business units and corporate functions to appropriately manage significant operational risk exposures. at an enterprise level, the torcc oversees operational risk. the torcc addresses firm-wide rather than business-specific issues and is mandated to prioritize technology and operational improvements that are significant and transformational.
operational risk is overseen at the corporate level within erm through the head of aig operational and technology controls, who reports directly to our cro. the head of aig operational and technology controls is responsible for the development and maintenance of the operational risk framework that includes policies, standards and deployment of systems.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management responsibilities, and the third line consists of our internal audit group that provides independent assurance covering aspects of the first and second lines of defense, in each case, to strengthen the governance, capability and delivery of operational risk management tools and methods. a key area of ongoing development is to have business leaders assume ownership and accountability for the risks and controls in their operating units, including support functions, for the operational risks that arise in their own processes and activities. in line with the three lines of defense model, the orm programs include, but are not limited to, several key components outlined below:
•     risk event capture - enables every employee to identify, document, and escalate operational risk events, with a view to enhancing processes and promoting lessons learned.
•     risk assessments - allows for the assessment, measurement and management of the key operational risks within our business units and helps inform on the efficacy of our control environment.
•     key risk indicators - enhances the ongoing monitoring and mitigation of operational risks and facilitate risk reporting.
•     issues management - enables a consistent tracking of issues across the firm, including policy and process exceptions, control deficiencies and findings from risk and control assessment activities.
•     scenario analyses - executed by first- and second-line professionals to identify potential risks that could result in financial losses in order to identify the financial implications of the risk to the firm and support the prioritization of operational risk treatment.
orm, working together with other control and assurance functions (e.g., compliance, financial controls unit / sarbanes oxley, global business continuity, and internal audit) through the integrated risk and control framework, provides an independent view of operational risks for each business, and works with the business unit cro and business unit oca to facilitate implementation of the above programs. this includes coverage of operational risks related to core insurance activities, investing, model risk, technology (including cyber security, identify and access management, data privacy and data security), third-party providers, as well as compliance and regulatory matters. based on the results of the risk identification and assessment efforts above, business leaders are accountable for tracking and remediating identified issues in line with our risk-monitoring procedures. governance committees support these efforts and promote transparency enabling improved management decision making.
an integrated risk and control framework facilitates the identification and mitigation of operational risk issues. to accomplish this, our integrated risk and control framework is designed to:
ensure first line accountability and ownership of risks and controls;
promote role clarity among the business and risk and control functions;
proactively address potential risk issues and assign clear ownership and accountability for risk treatment;
except as described above, we manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. a primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. to achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.
we operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. we manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of procedures:
•     underwriting approval processes and authorities;
•     exposure limits with ongoing monitoring;
•     management of relationship between assets and liabilities, including hedging;
150                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management
•     modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels (policy, line of business, product group, country, individual/group, correlation and catastrophic risk events);
•     compliance with financial reporting and capital and solvency targets;
•     review and challenge of reserves to ensure comprehensive analysis with established escalation procedures to provide appropriate transparency in reserving decisions and judgments made in the establishment of reserves.
we closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each line of business underwritten, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. we analyze concentrations of risk using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.
•     general insurance companies - risks covered include property, casualty, fidelity/surety, accident and health, aviation, and management liability. we manage risks in the general insurance business through aggregations and limitations of concentrations at multiple levels: policy, line of business, geography, industry and legal entity.
•     life and retirement companies - risks include mortality and morbidity in the insurance-oriented products and insufficient cash flows to cover contract liabilities and longevity risk in the retirement savings-oriented products. we manage risks through product design, sound medical and non-medical underwriting, and external reinsurance programs.
we purchase reinsurance for our insurance operations. reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. we may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. pooling of our reinsurance risks enables us to purchase reinsurance more efficiently at a consolidated level, manage global counterparty risk and relationships and manage global catastrophe risks.
governance insurance risks are monitored at the business unit level within erm and overseen by the business unit chief risk officer, who reports directly to our cro. the framework includes the following key components:
•     written policies that define the rules for our insurance risk-taking activities;
•     a limit framework focused on key insurance risks that aligns with our board-approved risk appetite statement; and
•     clearly defined authorities for all individuals and committee roles and responsibilities related to insurance risk management.
risk measurement, monitoring and limits we use a number of approaches to measure our insurance risk exposure, including:
stochastic methods. stochastic methods are used to measure and monitor risks including natural catastrophe, reserve and premium risk. we develop probabilistic estimates of risk based on our exposures, historical observed volatility or industry-recognized models in the case of catastrophe risk.
scenario analysis. scenario or deterministic analysis is used to measure and monitor risks such as terrorism or to estimate losses due to man-made catastrophic scenarios.
in addition, we monitor concentrations of exposure through insurance limits aggregated along dimensions such as geography, industry, or counterparty.
the risk monitoring responsibilities of the business units include ensuring compliance with insurance risk limits and escalation and remediation of limit breaches. such activities are reported to management by the relevant business unit for informative decision-making on a regular basis. this monitoring approach is aligned with our overall risk limits framework.
risk limits have a consistent framework used across aig, its business units, and legal entities. this includes escalation thresholds in cases where measurement is particularly challenging.
for further information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits see risk appetite, limits, identification, and measurement - risk limits herein.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management general insurance companies' key risks we manage our risks through risk review and selection processes, exposure limitations, exclusions, deductibles, self-insured retentions, coverage limits, attachment points, and reinsurance. this management is supported by sound underwriting practices, pricing procedures and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine overall adequacy of provisions for insurance. underwriting practices and pricing procedures incorporate historical experience, changes in underlying exposure, current regulation and judicial decisions as well as proposed or anticipated regulatory changes.
•     loss reserves - the potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the general insurance companies. there is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to our estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses. we manage this uncertainty through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. for further information see critical accounting estimates - insurance liabilities - loss reserves herein.
•     underwriting - the potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the general insurance companies' ability to achieve an underwriting profit. we develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. this may be driven by adverse economic conditions, unanticipated emergence of risks or increase in frequency of claims, worse than expected prepayment of policies, investment results, or unexpected or increased costs or expenses.
•     single risk loss exposure - our business is exposed to loss events that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. events such as fires or explosions can result in loss activity for our clients. the net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by our grc through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. furthermore, single risk loss exposure is managed and monitored on both a segregated and aggregated basis.
•     reinsurance - since we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the unrecoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated. the inability or unwillingness to pay is considered credit risk and is monitored through our credit risk management framework.
natural catastrophe risk we manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate probable maximum loss (pml) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.
we use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures. we apply a proprietary multi-model approach to account for relative strengths and weaknesses of vendor models, and make adjustments to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.
we perform post-catastrophe event studies to identify model weaknesses, underwriting gaps, and improvement opportunities. lessons learned from post-catastrophe event studies are incorporated into the modeling and underwriting processes of risk pricing and selection. the majority of policies exposed to catastrophic risks are one-year contracts that allow us to adjust our underwriting guidelines, pricing and exposure accumulation in a relatively short period.
we recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. with multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policy to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning. for example, we continually consider changes in climate and weather patterns as an integral part of the underwriting process. in addition, we are committed to providing innovative insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change, including expanding natural disaster resilience, promoting adaptation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. our internal product development, underwriting, modeling, and sustainability practices will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change.
152                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management our natural catastrophe exposure is primarily driven by the u.s. and japan, though our overall exposure is diversified across multiple countries. for example, we have exposures to additional perils such as european windstorms and floods and seismic events across the pacific rim. within the u.s., we have significant hurricane exposure in florida, the gulf of mexico, the northeast u.s. and mid-atlantic regions. events impacting the northeast u.s. and the mid-atlantic may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in those regions. within the u.s., we have significant earthquake exposure in california, the pacific northwest and new madrid regions. earthquakes impacting the pacific northwest and new madrid regions may result in a higher share of industry losses than other regions primarily due to our relative share of exposure in these regions.
the estimates below are the occurrence exceedance probability (oep) losses, which reflect losses that may occur in any single event due to the defined peril. the 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 pmls are the probable maximum losses from a single natural catastrophe event with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively.
(in millions)                        gross         reinsurance        reinsurance,   shareholder after tax(d)        equity exposures:
aig, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses. since there is no industry standard for assumptions and preparation of insured data for use in these models, our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.
also, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements and all catastrophe bonds attach and pay as modeled. however, reinsurance recoverable may not be fully collectible. in particular, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide commensurate levels of protection compared to traditional reinsurance transactions. therefore, these estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our exposure to these events.
our 2018 catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection on both an aggregate and occurrence basis with respect to north american exposures including united states, canada, mexico and the caribbean.
•     aggregate protection protects us against a high frequency of losses from certain events including windstorm, severe convective storm, earthquake, wildfire, and flood. under this part of the program, aig can recover up to $2.75 billion of aggregate losses in excess of $750 million. the event deductible is $100 million initially, but increases to $250 million for individual events greater than $750 million after the $750 million aggregate retention is exhausted. this protection will also cover a large event, providing coverage of up to $2 billion after the aggregate retention of $750 million is exhausted.
•     occurrence protection is provided primarily on a $2 billion excess of $2 billion basis, with one reinstatement, with an additional $750 million excess of $4 billion on top of that but with no reinstatement. the $750 million excess of $4 billion layer is shared with the top $750 million layer of aggregate protections, such that, only a total of $750 million of limit is available across those two layers.
additional multi-year coverages purchased in prior years provide additional coverage at various points of the program, including $125 million that is part of $500 million excess of $4.5 billion coverage from the catastrophe bond reinsurance contract we entered into with tradewynd re ltd. in 2014.
in addition, we continue to purchase specific covers to protect against catastrophic events in japan and have also purchased protection against severe losses for other international locations on a global basis.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management actual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. the occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
for additional information see also item 1a. risk factors - reserves and exposures.
terrorism risk we actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures to losses from terrorist attacks. we have set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios. terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the general insurance companies' exposures. examples of modeled scenarios are conventional bombs of different sizes, anthrax attacks and nuclear attacks.
our largest terrorism exposures are in new york city, and estimated losses are largely driven by the property and workers' compensation lines of business. at our largest exposure location, modeled losses for a five-ton bomb attack net of the terrorism risk insurance program (trip) and reinsurance recoveries are estimated to be $2.4 billion as of september 30, 2017.
our exposure to terrorism risk in the u.s. is mitigated by trip in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. trip covers terrorist attacks within the united states or u.s. missions and against certain u.s. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. in 2018, trip covers 82 percent of insured losses above a deductible, decreasing by one percent each year to 80 percent in 2020. the current estimate of our deductible is approximately $2.2 billion for 2017.
we offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. international terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. we also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-u.s. jurisdictions.
life and retirement companies' key risks we manage risk through product design, experience monitoring, pricing actions, risk limitations, reinsurance and active monitoring and management of the relationships between assets and liabilities, including hedging.
•     longevity risk - represents the risk of a change in value of a policy or benefit as a result of actual mortality rates being lower than the expected mortality rates. this risk could arise from longer-term societal health changes as well as other factors. this risk exists in a number of our product lines but is most significant for our pension risk transfer, structured settlement, and annuity products.
•     morbidity risk - represents the risk arising from actual morbidity (i.e,. illness, disability or disease) incidence being higher than expected or the length of the claims extending longer than expected resulting in a higher overall benefit payout. this risk could arise from longer-term medical advances in detection and treatment for various diseases and medical conditions, as well as other factors. this risk exists in certain product lines such as group benefits, health and long-term care businesses.
•     mortality risk - represents the risk of loss arising from actual mortality rates being higher than expected mortality rates. this risk could arise from pandemics or other events, including longer-term societal changes that cause higher-than-expected mortality. this risk exists in a number of our product lines, but is most significant for our life insurance products.
•     policyholder behavior risk including full and partial surrender/lapse risk - represents the risk that actual policyholder behavior differs from expected behavior in a manner that has an adverse effect on our operating results. there are many related assumptions made when products are sold, including how long the contracts will persist and other assumptions which impact the expected utilization of contract benefits and features. actual experience can vary significantly from these assumptions. this risk is impacted by a number of factors including changes in market conditions, especially changes in the levels of interest rate and equity markets, tax law, regulations, competitive landscape and policyholder preferences. this risk exists in the majority of our product lines.
the emergence of significant adverse experience compared to the initial assumptions at policy issuance or updated assumption would require an adjustment to dac and benefit reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for a particular period.
for additional discussion of the impact of actual and expected experience on dac and benefit reserves see critical accounting estimates - future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and critical accounting estimates - guaranteed benefit features of variable annuity products. for additional discussion of business risks see item 1a. risk factors - business and operations.
154                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management variable annuity risk management and hedging programs our individual and group retirement businesses offer variable annuity products with gmwb riders that guarantee a certain level of benefits. gmwb guaranteed living benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recorded in other realized capital gains (losses). gmwb features subject the life and retirement companies to market risk, including exposure to changes in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility.
variable annuity product design is the first step in managing our exposure to these market risks. risk mitigation features of our variable annuity product design include gmwb rider fees indexed to an equity market volatility index, which can provide additional fee assessments in periods of increased market volatility, required minimum allocations to fixed accounts to reduce overall equity exposure, and the utilization of volatility control funds, which reduce equity exposure in the funds in response to changes in market volatility, even under sudden or extreme market movements.
after reflecting our product risk-mitigating features, we hedge our remaining economic exposure to market risk within gmwb features through our variable annuity hedging program, which is designed to offset certain changes in the economic value of these gmwb embedded derivatives, within established thresholds. the hedging program is designed to provide additional protection against large and combined movements in interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and market volatility under multiple scenarios.
our hedging program utilizes an economic hedge target, which represents our estimate of the underlying economic risks in our gmwb riders, based on the present value of the future expected benefit payments for the gmwb, less the present value of future rider fees, over numerous stochastic scenarios. this stochastic projection method uses best estimate assumptions for policyholder behavior (including mortality, lapses, withdrawals and benefit utilization) in conjunction with market scenarios calibrated to observable equity and interest rate option prices. policyholder behaviors are regularly evaluated to compare current assumptions to actual experience and, if appropriate, changes are made to the policyholder behavior assumptions. the risk of changes in policyholder behavior is not explicitly hedged and such differences between expected and actual policyholder behaviors will result in hedge ineffectiveness.
due to differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and u.s. gaap valuation of the embedded derivative, which include differences in the treatment of rider fees and exclusion of certain risk margins and other differences in discount rates, we expect relative movements in the economic hedge target and the u.s. gaap embedded derivative valuation will vary over time with changes in equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads.
for information on the impact on our consolidated pre-tax income from the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives and the hedging portfolio, as well as additional discussion of differences between the economic hedge target and the valuation of the embedded derivatives see insurance reserves - life and annuity reserves and dac - variable annuity guaranteed benefits and hedging results.
in designing our hedging portfolio for our variable annuity hedging program, we make assumptions and projections about the future performance of the underlying contract holder funds. to project future account value changes, we make assumptions about how each of the underlying funds will perform. we map the contract holder funds to a set of publicly traded indices that we believe best represent the liability to be hedged. basis risk exists due to the variance between these assumptions and actual fund returns, which may result in variances between changes in the hedging portfolio and changes in the economic hedge target. net hedge results and the cost of hedging are also impacted by differences between realized volatility and implied volatility.
for index annuity and universal life products, we have a hedging program designed to manage the index crediting strategies associated with index annuity and index life products. this hedging program is designed to offset the economic risk with respect to the index returns for the current crediting rate reset period, and utilizes derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity index options and futures contracts. similarly as with the variable annuities, there are differences between the calculation of the economic hedge target and u.s. gaap valuation of the index annuity and index life embedded derivatives, which can lead to variances in their relative movements.
to manage the capital market exposures embedded within the economic hedge target, we identify and hedge market sensitivities to changes in equity markets, interest rates, volatility and for variable annuities, credit spreads. each hedge program purchases derivative instruments or securities having sensitivities that offset those in the economic hedge target, within internally defined threshold levels. since the relative movements of the hedging portfolio and the economic hedge target vary over time or with market changes, the net exposure can be outside the threshold limits, and adjustments to the hedging portfolio are made periodically to return the net exposure to within threshold limits.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management minimize counterparty credit risk, the majority of our derivative instrument hedges are implemented using exchange-traded futures and options, cleared through global exchanges. over the counter derivatives are highly collateralized.
the hedging programs are monitored on a daily basis to ensure that the economic hedge target and derivative portfolio are within the threshold limits, pursuant to the approved hedge strategy. daily risk monitoring verifies that the net risk exposures, as measured through sensitivities to a large set of market shocks, are within the approved net risk exposure threshold limits. in addition, monthly stress tests are performed to determine the program's effectiveness relative to the applicable limits, under an array of combined severe market stresses in equity prices, interest rates, volatility and credit spreads. finally, hedge strategies are reviewed regularly to gauge their effectiveness in managing our market exposures in the context of our overall risk appetite.
reinsurance activities reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss (life and non-life) exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes or death events. our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. in addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.
•     traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the united states, bermuda, london and europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;
•     capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles; and
we continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.
reinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. however, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.
in certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers' compensation.
•     life and annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves).
156                            aig | 2017 form 10-k table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management at december 31, 2017, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $33.0 billion. these assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $1.4 billion, ceded loss reserves of $26.9 billion including reserves for incurred but not reported (ibnr) claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $3.1 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $1.6 billion. the methods used to estimate ibnr and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. these methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. any adjustments are reflected in income. we believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at december 31, 2017 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.
the reinsurance credit department (rcd) conducts periodic detailed assessments of the financial strength and condition of current and potential reinsurers, both foreign and domestic. the rcd monitors both the financial condition of reinsurers as well as the total reinsurance recoverable ceded to reinsurers, and sets limits with regard to the amount and type of exposure we are willing to take with reinsurers. as part of these assessments, we attempt to identify whether a reinsurer is appropriately licensed, assess its financial capacity and liquidity, and evaluate the local economic and financial environment in which a foreign reinsurer operates. the rcd reviews the nature of the risks ceded and the need for measures, including collateral to mitigate credit risk. for example, in our treaty reinsurance contracts, we frequently include provisions that require a reinsurer to post collateral or use other measures to reduce exposure when a referenced event occurs. furthermore, we limit our unsecured exposure to reinsurers through the use of credit triggers such as insurer financial strength rating downgrades, declines in regulatory capital, or relevant risk-based capital (rbc) ratios fall below certain levels. we also set maximum limits for reinsurance recoverable exposure, which in some cases is the recoverable amount plus an estimate of the maximum potential exposure from unexpected events for a reinsurer. in addition, credit executives within erm review reinsurer exposures and credit limits and approve reinsurer credit limits above specified levels. finally, even where we conclude that uncollateralized credit risk is acceptable, we require collateral from active reinsurance counterparties where it is necessary for our subsidiaries to recognize the reinsurance recoverable assets for statutory accounting purposes. at december 31, 2017, we held $20.5 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers. we believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of risk to aig, nor is our business substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance contract.
at december 31, 2017, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. reinsurer capital levels continued to increase in 2017, thereby increasing the industry's underwriting capacity, which resulted in continued competition and lower rates for 2018 renewals. reduced profitability associated with lower rates could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. the rcd, in conjunction with the credit executives within erm, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require the reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.
table of contents item 7 | enterprise risk management other business risks derivative transactions we utilize derivatives principally to enable us to hedge exposure to interest rates, currencies, credit, commodities, equities and other risks. credit risk associated with derivative counterparties exists for a derivative contract when that contract has a positive fair value to us. the maximum potential exposure will increase or decrease during the life of the derivative commitments as a function of maturity and market conditions. all derivative transactions must be transacted within counterparty limits that have been approved by erm.
we evaluate counterparty credit quality by internal analysis consistent with the aig credit policy. we utilize various credit enhancements, including letters of credit, guarantees, collateral, credit triggers, credit derivatives, margin agreements and subordination to reduce the credit risk relating to outstanding financial derivative transactions. we require credit enhancements in connection with specific transactions based on, among other things, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, and transaction size and maturity. furthermore, we enter into certain agreements that have the benefit of set-off and close-out netting provisions, such as isda master agreements. these provisions provide that, in the case of an early termination of a transaction, we can set off receivables from a counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all covered transactions. as a result, where a legally enforceable netting agreement exists, the fair value of the transaction with the counterparty represents the net sum of estimated fair values.
the fair value of our interest rate, currency, credit, commodity and equity swaps, options, swaptions, and forward commitments, futures, and forward contracts reported as a component of other assets, was approximately $0.9 billion at december 31, 2017 and $1.8 billion at december 31, 2016. where applicable, these amounts have been determined in accordance with the respective master netting agreements.
the following table presents the fair value of our derivatives portfolios in asset positions by internal counterparty credit rating:
for additional discussion related to derivative transactions see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
acquisition ratio  acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned.  acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of voba and dac. acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs and certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting.
additional premium represents a premium on an insurance policy over and above the initial premium imposed at the beginning of the policy. an additional premium may be assessed if the insured's risk is found to have increased significantly.
adjusted revenues exclude net realized capital gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in other income for gaap purposes) and changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in net investment income for gaap purposes).
assets under management include assets in the general and separate accounts of our subsidiaries that support liabilities and surplus related to our life and annuity insurance products and the notional value of stable value wrap contracts.
base spread  net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and other enhancements, less interest credited excluding amortization of sales inducement assets.
base yield net investment income excluding income from alternative investments and other enhancements, as a percentage of average base invested asset portfolio, which excludes alternative investments, other bond securities and certain other investments for which the fair value option has been elected.
book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) and book value per common share, excluding aoci and deferred tax assets (dta) (adjusted book value per common share) are non-gaap measures and are used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-share basis. book value per common share excluding aoci is derived by dividing total aig shareholders' equity, excluding aoci, by total common shares outstanding. adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total aig shareholders' equity, excluding aoci and dta (adjusted shareholders' equity), by total common shares outstanding.

cva  credit valuation adjustment  the cva adjusts the valuation of derivatives to account for nonperformance risk of our counterparty with respect to all net derivative assets positions. also, the cva reflects the fair value movement in aigfp's asset portfolio that is attributable to credit movements only, without the impact of other market factors such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates. finally, the cva also accounts for our own credit risk in the fair value measurement of all derivative net liability positions and liabilities where aig has elected the fair value option, when appropriate.
dac  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business.
table of contents glossary dac related to unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments   an adjustment to dac and reserves for investment-oriented products, equal to the change in dac and unearned revenue amortization that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields.  an adjustment to benefit reserves for investment-oriented products is also recognized to reflect the application of the benefit ratio to the accumulated assessments that would have been recorded if fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale had been sold at their stated aggregate fair value and the proceeds reinvested at current yields (collectively referred to as "shadow investment-oriented adjustments").
for long-duration traditional products, significant unrealized appreciation of investments in a sustained low interest rate environment may cause additional future policy benefit liabilities to be recorded (shadow loss reserves).
deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance  retroactive reinsurance is a reinsurance contract in which an assuming entity agrees to reimburse a ceding entity for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events. if the amount of premium paid by the ceding reinsurer is less than the related ceded loss reserves, the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the settlement period of the reserves. any related development on the ceded loss reserves recoverable under the contract would increase the deferred gain if unfavorable, or decrease the deferred gain if favorable.
expense ratio  sum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned.
general operating expense ratio  general operating expenses divided by net premiums earned. general operating expenses are those costs that are generally attributed to the support infrastructure of the organization and include but are not limited to personnel costs, projects and bad debt expenses. general operating expenses exclude losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses, and investment expenses.

loss reserves  liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date, whether or not reported to the insurer at that date.
master netting agreement  an agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts covered by such agreement, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or upon termination of any one such contract.
net premiums written represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period, while net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period.

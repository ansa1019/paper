item 1a.    risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business.
risks related to our business and industry we are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.
our business is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, including:
•   significant competition from multiple hospitality providers in all parts of the world;
•   changes in operating costs, including employee compensation and benefits, energy, insurance and food;
•   the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations;
•   the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs;
•   significant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage;
•   the ability of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers;
•   the quality of services provided by franchisees;
•   the availability and cost of capital necessary for us and third-party hotel owners to fund investments, capital expenditures and service debt obligations;
•   the financial condition of third-party property owners, developers and joint venture partners;
•   relationships with third-party property owners, developers and joint venture partners, including the risk that owners may terminate our management, franchise or joint venture contracts;
•   changes in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels in our business, geographic concentration of our operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development;
any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services, or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties. as a result, any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.
macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services, including demand for rooms at our hotels. these factors include, but are not limited to:
•   changes in general economic conditions, including low consumer confidence, unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the u.s. or global economy;
•   governmental action and uncertainty resulting from u.s. and global political trends and policies, including potential barriers to travel, trade and immigration;
•   war, political instability or civil unrest, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;
•   statements, actions, or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travel-related activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities;
•   the financial and general business condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries and its effect on travel, including decreased airline capacity and routes;
•   conditions that negatively shape public perception of travel, including travel-related accidents and outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as ebola, zika, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), h1n1 (swine flu) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers);
•   climate change or availability of natural resources;
•   changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers; and
•   organized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics.
any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.
consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement. declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties. in addition, many of the expenses associated with our business, including personnel costs, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities, are relatively fixed. during a period of overall economic weakness, if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.
the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility, which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition.
the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the customer base served. we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest. in addition, the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis. the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition.
because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively.
the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition. our principal competitors are other operators of luxury, full service and focused service hotels, including other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. we also compete against smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners and operators, home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators. if we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues or profits may decline.
competition for hotel guests we face competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business. we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, room rates, property size and availability of rooms and conference space, quality of the accommodations, customer satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. our competitors may have greater commercial, financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms, which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively, or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer.
competition for management and franchise contracts we compete to enter into management and franchise contracts. our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services, brand name recognition and reputation, our ability and willingness to invest capital, availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas, and the overall economic terms of our contracts and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands. if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors, if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors, or if the availability of suitable properties is limited, our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise contracts could be reduced.
any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.
our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation. in addition, the success of our hotel owners' businesses and their ability to make payments to us for our services may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands. if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality, we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels, and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners.
changes in ownership or management practices, the occurrence of accidents or injuries, natural disasters, crime, individual guest notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation, create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business. because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations, events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations. in addition, the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity. we also could face legal claims related to negative events, along with resulting adverse publicity. a perceived decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our business is subject to risks related to doing business with third-party property owners that could adversely affect our reputation, operational results or prospects for growth.
unless we maintain good relationships with third-party hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise contracts, we may be unable to expand our presence and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
our business depends on our ability to establish and maintain long-term, positive relationships with third-party property owners and our ability to enter into new and renew management and franchise contracts. although our management and franchise contracts are typically long-term arrangements, hotel owners may be able to terminate the contracts under certain circumstances, including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria. our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to, among other things, risks common to the overall hotel industry, including factors outside of our control. in addition, negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners. if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable terms, we may be unable to expand our presence and our business, and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
growth of our business is affected, and may potentially be limited, by factors influencing real estate development generally, including site availability, financing, planning, zoning and other local approvals. in addition, market factors such as projected room occupancy, changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply, geographic area restrictions in management and franchise contracts, costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure, if not managed effectively by our third-party owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business.
if our third-party property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties, or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans, our revenues, profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed.
many of our third-party property owners pledged their properties as collateral for mortgage loans entered into at the time of development, purchase or refinancing. if our third-party property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all, their lenders could declare a default, accelerate the related debt and repossess the property. while we maintain certain contractual protections, repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise contract or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property. in addition, the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy, develop and improve hotels and in some cases, fund operations during down cycles. our hotel owners' inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels, result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio.
substantially all of our management and franchise contracts, as well as our license agreement with hgv, require third-party property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands, which include requirements related to the physical condition, safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees. these standards may evolve with customer preference, or we may introduce new requirements over time. if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards, guest preference for our brands could diminish. in addition, if third-party property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements, we may elect to exercise our termination rights, which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts. we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships.
contractual and other disagreements with third-party property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses.
our management and franchise contracts require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements. any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us, even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor. we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation, the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party. furthermore, specific to our industry, some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of third-party hotel properties, which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate contracts even where the contracts do not expressly provide for termination. our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated, and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations.
as of december 31, 2017, we had a total of 2,257 hotels in our development pipeline, which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands. the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have contracts are subject to numerous conditions, and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks, including, in certain cases, the owner's or developer's ability to obtain adequate financing and obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals. as a result, not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system.
new hotel brands or non-hotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
since 2011, we have opened hotels under five new brands: home2 suites by hilton; curio - a collection by hilton; canopy by hilton; tru by hilton; and, most recently, tapestry collection by hilton. we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and non-hotel brands in the future. in addition, the hilton garden inn, doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states over the past several years. we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets. new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners, franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces. if new branded hotel products, non-hotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate, we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs, reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions.
•   loss in value of real estate due to changes in market conditions or the area in which real estate is located;
•   increased potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties;
•   the ongoing need for capital improvements and expenditures funded by us to maintain or upgrade properties and contractual requirements to deliver properties back to landlords in a particular state of repair and condition at the end of a lease term;
•   periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements;
•   risks associated with any mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing;
•   contingent liabilities that exist after we have exited a property;
•   the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets.
the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned or leased properties because we, as the owner or lessee, bear the risk of their high fixed-cost structure. further, during times of economic distress, declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values, and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all. accordingly, we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed many years ago. the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs, either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties. there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur, or even if completed, will result in improved performance. in addition, these efforts are subject to a number of risks, including:
•   obtaining zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations;
•   changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand for improvements that we make or negative project returns;
•   volatility in the debt and capital markets that may limit our ability to raise capital for projects or improvements;
•   lack of availability of rooms or meeting spaces for revenue-generating activities during construction, modernization or renovation projects;
our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed.
certain of our properties may qualify as legally-permissible nonconforming uses and improvements. if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty, we might not be permitted to rebuild that property
as it now exists, regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds. any loss of this nature, whether insured or not, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.
we have investments in joint venture projects, which limits our ability to manage third-party risks associated with these projects.
in most cases, we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved. therefore, joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a co-venturer in an investment might become bankrupt, be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations, have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations. in addition, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners, or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent. consequently, actions by a co-venturer or other third party could expose us to claims for damages, financial penalties and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our business and operations. in addition, we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or co-venturer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other co-venturers. such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a co-venturer, in which case we may be liable in the event that our co-venturer defaults on its guarantee obligation. the non-performance of a co-venturer's obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed.
although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow, in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners. additionally, in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it. because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us, our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments.
failures in, material damage to, or interruptions in our information technology systems, software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business. we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management, procurement, reservations and the operation of the hilton honors guest loyalty program. such systems are subject to, among other things, damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses and natural and man-made disasters. although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location to back up our core reservation, distribution and financial systems, substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility. although we are migrating portions of our operations to cloud-based providers while simultaneously building and operating new applications and services with those cloud-based providers, any loss or damage to our primary facility could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site. damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result. in addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance.
we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide. in particular, our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties. the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner. if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services, or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner, we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all, and our business could be adversely affected.
we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business. the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner.
we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications, including changes in required technology interfaces, website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures, costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications. additional risks include computer malware, changes in applicable federal and state regulation, security breaches, legal claims related to our website operations and e-commerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns. our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
from time to time we and our third-party service providers experience cyber-attacks, attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events, which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations. the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time, and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents. in november 2015, we announced that we had identified and taken action to eradicate unauthorized malware that targeted payment card information in some point-of-sale systems in our hotels and had determined that specific payment card information was targeted by this malware. we expect we will be subject to additional cyber-attacks in the future and may experience data breaches.
even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years. breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of customer, employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites, mobile applications, point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us. such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, litigation and other costs or liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business.
we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests' personal data and other sensitive information.
we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of sensitive information, including those related to compliance with u.s. and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations, as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information. for example, the european union's general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), which becomes effective in may 2018 and replaces the current data protection laws of each eu member state, requires companies to meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data, and failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 percent of worldwide revenue. we collect internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes, including managing our workforce, providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes. we could be exposed to fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation, reputational harm or other expenses, or other adverse effects on our business, due to failure to protect our guests' personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various u.s. and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards.
in addition, states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft. these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business, and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies. if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws, or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position.
the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management, brand assurance and compliance, procurement, reservation systems, operation of our guest loyalty programs, distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities. these technologies may require refinements and upgrades. the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us. as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required, we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as
needed or in a cost-effective and timely manner. we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system.
we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties, or through alliances, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets. these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management's attention.
we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands, businesses, properties or other assets. furthermore, we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties. in many cases, we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us. acquisitions or investments in brands, businesses, properties or assets as well as third-party alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:
•   assuming contingent liabilities; or
•   creating additional expenses.
we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. similarly, we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all, or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness. in addition, the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations.
we also may divest certain properties or assets, and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect. in some circumstances, sales of properties or other assets may result in losses. upon sales of properties or assets, we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations, incur material tax liabilities or, as a result of required debt repayment, face a shortage of liquidity. finally, any acquisitions, investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations, which could harm our business.
failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws, including with regard to direct marketing, could result in fines or place restrictions on our business.
we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email and social media marketing and postal mailings, and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the u.s. and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices. any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretation of such laws, such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991, the telemarketing sales rule, can-spam act of 2003, and various u.s. state laws, new laws, or international data protection laws, such as the eu gdpr, that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy. if this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers. we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies' marketing materials. if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired.
the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability.
a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries, to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems. search engines and peer-to-peer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business. if these bookings increase, certain hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees. these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce these bookings by de-ranking our hotels in search results on their platforms, and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels. although our contracts with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
renegotiate these contracts upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration, replacement or renegotiation. moreover, hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites. as a result, consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries' offered brands, websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems. if this happens, our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites, which increases costs to hotels in our system. internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny, particularly in europe. the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels.
in addition, although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual leisure consumers or "transient" business rather than "group" business for meetings and events, in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to group business and also to corporate transient business. if that growth continues, it could both divert group and corporate transient business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and corporate transient business. consolidation of internet travel intermediaries, or the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business, also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels' cost of sales.
our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results.
we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly, either online, by telephone to our call centers, through devices via our mobile application, or through intermediaries like travel agents, internet travel web sites and other distribution channels. the cost, speed, efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands. any failure to maintain or upgrade, and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business.
the cessation, reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton honors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty.
we manage the hilton honors guest loyalty program for the hilton brands. program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value. the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise contracts. system hotels (including, without limitation, third-party hotels under management and franchise arrangements) contribute a percentage of the loyalty member's charges to the program for each stay of a program member. in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands, hilton honors arranges with third parties, such as airlines, other transportation services, online vendors, retailers and credit card companies, to sell honors points for the use of their customers and/or to allow honors members to use or exchange points for products or services. currently, the program benefits are not taxed as income to members. if the program awards and benefits are materially altered, curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton honors members choose to no longer participate in the program, this could adversely affect our business.
because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states, the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.
we currently manage, franchise, own or lease hotels and resorts in 105 countries and territories around the world. our operations outside the united states represented approximately 23 percent, 28 percent and 31 percent of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenues. as a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states, including:
•   rapid changes in governmental, economic or political policy, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or u.s. anti-boycott legislation;
•   recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets;
•   the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate non-u.s. earnings in a tax-efficient manner;
•   the ability to comply with or the effect of complying with complex and changing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations, including foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, tariffs, embargoes, increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws;
•   instability or changes in a country's or region's economic, regulatory or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change resulting from the u.k.'s june 2016 vote to leave the european union (commonly known as "brexit");
these factors may adversely affect the revenues earned from and the market value of properties that we own or lease located in international markets. while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations.
failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs, reduce profits, limit growth or subject us to broader liability.
our business operations in countries outside the u.s. are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the fcpa, as well as trade sanctions administered by the ofac. the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on u.s. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions, rules and regulations, it is possible that hotels we manage or own in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions. where we have identified potential violations in the past, we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac. in addition, some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of non-u.s. jurisdictions, including the u.k.'s bribery act 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations.
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties, including the termination of management, franchising and ownership rights. in addition, in certain circumstances, the actions of parties affiliated with us (including our owners, joint venture partners, employees and agents) may expose us to liability under the fcpa, u.s. sanctions or other laws. these restrictions could increase costs of operations, reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth.
in august 2012, congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 ("itrshra"), which expands the scope of u.s. sanctions against iran and syria. in particular, section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require sec-reporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates. these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report, and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the u.s. president and certain u.s. congressional committees. the u.s. president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and, within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities, to determine whether sanctions should be imposed.
under itrshra, we are required to report if we or any of our "affiliates" knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10-k or quarterly reports on form 10-q. we have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra. in addition, because the sec defines the term "affiliate" broadly, we may be deemed to be an affiliate of hna or hna's affiliates or blackstone or blackstone's affiliates. other affiliates of hna or blackstone have in the past or may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra. disclosure of such activities, even if such activities are permissible under applicable law, and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations.
our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives. finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult. losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships, including relationships with third-party property owners, significant customers, joint venture partners and vendors, and limit our ability to execute our business strategies.
we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed, owned and leased hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of employees. these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide. the failure to retain, train or successfully manage general managers for our managed, owned and leased hotels could negatively affect our operations.
collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations, increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.
a significant number of our employees (approximately 31 percent) and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements. if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse, the properties we manage, franchise, own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes, lockouts, boycotts and public demonstrations. a number of our collective bargaining agreements, representing approximately 15 percent of our organized employees, have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated, and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized. labor disputes, which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners, result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests. further, adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs, changes in work rules that raise operating expenses, legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our third-party property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns. we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many third-party property owners. increased unionization of our workforce, new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations, reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.
labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, train, manage and engage employees. we employ or manage more than 163,000 individuals at our managed, owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world. if we are unable to attract, retain, train, manage and engage skilled individuals, our ability to staff and manage the hotels that we manage, own and lease could be impaired, which could reduce customer satisfaction. in addition, the inability of our franchisees to attract, retain, train, manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands. staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses. because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees.
the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success. we have nearly 5,900 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services, plus at any given time, a number of pending applications for trademarks and other intellectual property. however, those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use, control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the u.s. and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization. we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions. for example, in certain jurisdictions, third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks, which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction. third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications. defending against any such proceedings may be costly, and if unsuccessful, could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights. obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive, and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks.
our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the u.s., where local law, or lax enforcement of law, may not provide adequate protection. if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used, the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed. there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. litigation of this type could be costly, force us to divert our resources, lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation. in addition, we license certain of our trademarks to third parties. for example, we have granted hgv the right to use certain of our marks and intellectual property in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property. if hgv, a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks, our rights to, and the value of, our trademarks could potentially be harmed. failure to maintain, control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or third-party owners, and could adversely affect our results.
in addition, we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties, including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees. if we are unable to use this intellectual property, our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished.
third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets. we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future. any such claims, even those without merit, could:
•   limit our ability to develop new intellectual property; and
•   limit the use or the scope of our intellectual property or other rights.
in addition, we may be required to indemnify third-party owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them. all necessary royalty, licensing or other contracts may not be available to us on acceptable terms. any adverse results associated with third-party intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business.
conducting business in currencies other than the u.s. dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results. we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the u.s. as a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of u.s. dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the u.s. dollars received from foreign currency revenues. we also have exposure to currency translation risk because, generally, the results of our business outside of the u.s. are reported in local currency and then translated to u.s. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, changes between the foreign exchange rates and the u.s. dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results. our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the u.s. increases.
to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure, we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions. however, these hedging agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs, credit requirements and counterparty risk.
if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage, franchise or own, our profits could be reduced.
we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses exists, and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us, our owners or the surrounding area. we carry, and/or we require our owners to carry, insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first- and third-party losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary. nevertheless, market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners' ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates such as those natural disasters that occurred in 2017. we anticipate increased costs of property insurance across the portfolio in 2018 due to the significant losses that insurers suffered globally in 2017. in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that we and/or our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations, our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property. because certain types of losses are uncertain, they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive. in addition, there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies.
in some cases, these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured. as a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues, profits, management fees or franchise fees from the property.
following the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington, d.c. area, congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002, which established the terrorism risk insurance program (the "program") to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts. the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized, with some adjustments to its provisions, in january 2015 for six years through december 31, 2020. we carry, and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry, insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both first-party and third-party liability losses related to terrorism. we purchase our first-party property damage and business interruption insurance from a stand-alone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools. if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2020, or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers, premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase and/or the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available, perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable.
terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry.
the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11, 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future. in particular, properties that are well-known or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks.
the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could:
•   result in higher costs for security and insurance premiums or diminish the availability of insurance coverage for losses related to terrorist attacks, particularly for properties in target areas, all of which could adversely affect our results.
the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations. furthermore, the loss of any of our well-known buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands, which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects.
changes in u.s. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law, or adverse determinations by tax authorities, could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
we are subject to taxation at the federal, state or provincial and local levels in the u.s. and various other countries and jurisdictions. our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. from time to time, the u.s. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in u.s. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. in particular, our consolidated u.s. federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2005 through december 31, 2013 are under audit by the internal revenue service ("irs"), and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans, our hilton honors guest loyalty program and our foreign-currency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries. in total, the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in u.s. federal tax owed of approximately $874 million, excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes. we disagree with the irs's position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them. see note 14: "income taxes" in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.
changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations.
new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective, and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. see note 2: "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted.
our total assets include goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of long-lived assets, principally property and equipment, including hotel properties. we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value. we evaluate our intangible assets with finite useful lives and long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results. after performing our evaluation for impairment, including an analysis to determine the recoverability of long-lived assets, we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change, we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets. if these impairment losses are significant, our results of operations would be adversely affected.
in many jurisdictions, the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or u.s. federal, state and local governmental regulations, including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages, the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements. we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or u.s. state and local departments relating to health, sanitation, fire and safety standards, and to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions status and citizenship requirements. in addition, the national labor relations board has revised its standard for joint employee relationships, which could increase our risk of being considered a joint employer with our franchisees. we or our third-party owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or u.s. federal, state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties. the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements, or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
foreign or u.s. environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities.
we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and u.s. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. our failure to comply with such laws, including any required permits or licenses, could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated real property (including managed and franchised properties) or at third-party locations in connection with our waste disposal operations, regardless of whether or not we knew of, or caused, the presence or release of such substances. from time to time, we may be required to remediate such substances or remove, abate or manage asbestos, mold, radon gas, lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties. the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in third-party claims for personal injury, property or natural resource damages, business interruption or other losses. such claims and the need to investigate, remediate or otherwise address hazardous, toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations, the value of any affected real property, or our ability to sell, lease or assign our rights in any such property, or could otherwise harm our business or reputation. environmental, health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs may increase as a result. new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us.
the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the u.s. may be substantial.
we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ("ada") and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the u.s. under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26, 1993; public accommodations built before january 26, 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is "readily achievable." the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe. the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. any imposition of injunctive relief, fines, damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise contract and negatively affect the reputation of our brands. in november 2010, we entered into a settlement with the u.s. department of justice related to compliance with the ada. our obligations under this settlement expired in march 2015 except that certain managed and franchised hotels that were required to conduct surveys of their facilities remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15, 2022 and we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period. if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada, we could be subject to fines, penalties, injunctive action, reputational harm and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations.
•   location, including proximity to or easy access from major population centers;
•   local, regional or national economic and political conditions;
jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located, including puerto rico and egypt, have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming. these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered. once issued, a registration remains in force until revoked. the law defines the grounds for registration, as well as revocation or suspension of such registration. the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results.
we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us.
legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees, third-party owners of managed properties, employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results. in recent years, a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters, consumer protection claims and other commercial matters. a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time, and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. at any given time, we may be engaged in lawsuits or disputes involving third-party owners of our hotels. similarly, we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others, the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
risks related to our spin-offs we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spin-offs.
although we believe that separating our ownership business and our timeshare business by means of the spin-offs has provided financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders, the spin-offs may not provide results on the scope or scale we anticipate, and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits. for example, if the statutory and regulatory requirements relating to reits are not met by park, the benefits of spinning off the ownership business may be reduced or may be unavailable to us, our stockholders and stockholders of park. if we do not realize the intended benefits of the spin-offs, we or the businesses that were spun off could suffer a material adverse effect on our or their business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the spin-offs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.
we received a private letter ruling from the irs on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spin-offs as tax-free distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs, the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us. further, the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spin-offs under section 355 of the code and does not represent a determination by the irs that all of the requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied. moreover, if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect,
or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spin-offs, the private letter ruling could be invalidated. the opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spin-offs regarding the qualification of the spin-offs as tax-free distributions under section 355 of the code similarly relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spun-off companies and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. additionally, recently enacted legislation denies tax-free treatment to a spin-off in which either the distributing corporation or the spun-off corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spun-off corporation from electing reit status for a 10-year period following a tax-free spin-off. under an effective date provision, the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7, 2015. because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request, we believe the legislation does not apply to the spin-off of park. however, no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard. in particular, the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spin-offs. if the legislation applied to the spin-off of park, either the spin-off would not qualify for tax-free treatment or park would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10-year period following the spin-off.
if the spin-offs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, if the spin-offs were taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of park and hgv would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.
in connection with the spin-offs, we, park and hgv entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and, as to park, management agreements, and, as to hgv, a license agreement. certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other following the spin-offs. we are relying on park and hgv to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements. in addition, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us, park and hgv and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to park and to hgv, particularly if park or hgv were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations. the impact of any of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could cause reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
in connection with the spin-offs, each of park and hgv indemnified us for certain liabilities. these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by park and hgv, and park and hgv may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future.
in connection with the spin-offs, each of park and hgv indemnified us with respect to such parties' assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spin-offs. there can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of park and hgv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities. third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that park and hgv have agreed to assume. even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from park or hgv any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if we are required to indemnify park or hgv in connection with the spin-offs, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, which could negatively affect our financial results.
pursuant to the distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spin-offs and certain other agreements among park and hgv and us, we agreed to indemnify each of park and hgv from certain liabilities. indemnities that we may be required to provide park and/or hgv may be significant and could negatively affect our business.
risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.
we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2017, our total indebtedness, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts, was approximately $6.7 billion, and our contractual debt maturities of our long-term debt for the years ending december 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, were $54 million, $55 million and $57 million. our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences, including:
•   requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures or dividends to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunities;
•   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;
•   making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness;
•   restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, satisfaction of debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.
we are a holding company, and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by, and most of our business is conducted through, our subsidiaries. revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses. if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us, that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations. moreover, there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws, including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits. as a result, although a subsidiary of ours may have cash, we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations.
certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.
the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions limit our ability and/or the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:
•   incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;
•   pay dividends (including to us) and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;
•   enter into transactions with affiliates;
•   enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the issuers;
in addition, if, on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters, the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans, swing line loans and/or letters of credit (excluding up to $50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or back-stopped) that are issued and/or outstanding is greater than 30 percent of the revolving credit facility, the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 7.0 to 1.0.
as a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.
our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above, as well as other terms of our other indebtedness and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control.
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. to a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. in addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives. finally, our ability to raise additional equity capital may be restricted by the stockholders agreement we entered into with hgv and certain entities affiliated with blackstone that is intended to preserve the tax-free status of the spin-offs of park and hgv.
despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.
we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future. although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase.
risks related to ownership of our common stock the interests of certain of our stockholders may conflict with ours or yours in the future.
hna, which purchased 25 percent of our common stock from blackstone in march 2017, beneficially owned approximately 26.0 percent of our common stock as of december 31, 2017 as a result of our share repurchases lowering our total number of shares outstanding. blackstone and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 5.4 percent of our common stock as of december 31, 2017. moreover, under our by-laws and each stockholders' agreement with hna and blackstone, for so long as hna or blackstone, as applicable, retains specified levels of ownership of us, we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by them. thus, for so long as hna and blackstone continue to own specified percentages of our stock, each will be able to influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. accordingly, during that period of time, each of hna and blackstone may have influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers. for example, for so long as hna or blackstone continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, hna or blackstone may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors occurs. the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.
each of hna and blackstone and its respective affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in the hospitality industry. in the ordinary course of their business activities, each of hna and blackstone and their respective affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with ours or those of our stockholders. for example, hna acquired carlson hotels in december 2016 and owns an interest in nh hotel group. blackstone owns interests in la quinta holdings inc. and certain other investments in the hospitality industry and may pursue ventures that compete directly or indirectly with us. in addition, affiliates of hna and blackstone directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise, and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us, including hotel development projects, that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of blackstone, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. under our stockholders agreement with hna, we agreed to renounce any interest or expectancy, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity or corporate opportunity presented to hna or its affiliates. hna or blackstone also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may be unavailable to us. in addition, hna or blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their respective investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to you.
although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we have no obligation to do so, and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders. the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, limitations imposed by our indebtedness, legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
future issuances of common stock by us, and the availability for resale of shares held by certain investors, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
blackstone owned approximately 5.4 percent and hna owned approximately 26.0 percent of our outstanding common stock as of december 31, 2017. pursuant to registration rights agreements, blackstone and certain management stockholders have, and hna will have, the right to cause us, in certain instances, at our expense, to file registration statements under the securities act covering resales of our common stock held by them. these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act, depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates. as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. hna is subject to specified transfer restrictions pursuant to the terms of a stockholders agreement with us. those restrictions are subject to specified exceptions, including in connection with margin loan arrangements and any proposed transfers that a majority of the disinterested members of our board of directors may approve. each of hna and blackstone has pledged
substantially all of the shares of our common stock held by it pursuant to margin loan arrangements and any foreclosure upon those shares could result in sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market. sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock.
anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. among other things:
•   although we do not have a stockholder rights plan, and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year, these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;
•   these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office;
•   these provisions provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our by-laws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and
further, as a delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. these anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview our business hilton is one of the largest and fastest growing hospitality companies in the world, with 5,284 properties comprising 856,115 rooms in 105 countries and territories as of december 31, 2017. our premier brand portfolio includes: our luxury and lifestyle hotel brands, waldorf astoria hotels & resorts, conrad hotels & resorts and canopy by hilton; our full service hotel brands, hilton hotels & resorts, curio - a collection by hilton, doubletree by hilton, tapestry collection by hilton and embassy suites by hilton; our focused service hotel brands, hilton garden inn, hampton by hilton, tru by hilton, homewood suites by hilton and home2 suites by hilton; and our timeshare brand, hilton grand vacations. as of december 31, 2017, we had approximately 71 million members in our award-winning guest loyalty program, hilton honors, a 20 percent increase from december 31, 2016.
recent events on january 3, 2017, we completed the spin-offs of park and hgv. the historical financial results of park and hgv are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. see note 3: "discontinued operations" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
on january 3, 2017, we completed a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of hilton's outstanding common stock. see note 1: "organization" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
segments and regions management analyzes our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions. our operations consist of two reportable segments that are based on similar products or services: (i) management and franchise; and (ii) ownership. the management and franchise segment provides services, including hotel management and licensing of our brands. this segment generates its revenue from: (i) management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners; (ii) license fees for the exclusive right to use certain hilton marks and intellectual property; and (iii) affiliate fees charged to owned and leased hotels. as a manager of hotels, we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees. as a franchisor of hotels, we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services, such as our reservation system, marketing and information technology services. the ownership segment primarily derives earnings from providing hotel room rentals, food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels.
geographically, management conducts business through three distinct geographic regions: (i) the americas; (ii) europe, middle east and africa ("emea"); and (iii) asia pacific. the americas region includes north america, south america and central america, including all caribbean nations. although the u.s. is included in the americas, it represented 74 percent of our system-wide hotel rooms as of december 31, 2017; therefore, the u.s. is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region overall and, as such, it is presented separately within the analysis herein. the emea region includes europe, which represents the western-most peninsula of eurasia stretching from iceland in the west to russia in the east, and the middle east and africa ("mea"), which represents the middle east region and all african nations, including the indian ocean island nations. europe and mea are often analyzed separately and, as such, are presented separately within the analysis herein. the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia, as well as india, australia, new zealand and the pacific island nations.
system growth and pipeline our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and fee-based business. as we enter into new management and franchise contracts, we expand our business with minimal or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor, since the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the third-party owner of the hotel with whom we contract to provide management or franchise services. additionally, prior to approving the addition of new properties to our management and franchise development pipeline, we evaluate the economic viability of the property based on its geographic location, the credit quality of the third-party owner and other factors. by increasing the number of management
and franchise contracts with third-party owners, we expect to increase overall return on invested capital and cash available for return to stockholders.
as of december 31, 2017, we had a total of 2,257 hotels in our development pipeline, representing approximately 345,000 rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 107 countries and territories, including 39 countries and territories where we do not currently have any open hotels. all of the rooms in the pipeline are within our management and franchise segment. over 182,000 of the rooms in the pipeline, or more than half, were located outside the u.s. additionally, over 174,000 rooms in the pipeline, or more than half, were under construction. we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us.
•   franchise fees. represents fees received in connection with the licensing of our brands. under our franchise contracts, franchisees typically pay us franchise fees that include: (i) application, initiation and other fees for when new hotels enter the system, when there is a change of ownership or a contract is extended; and (ii) monthly royalty fees, generally calculated as a percentage of gross room revenue, and, for our full service brands, a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues, as applicable. we also earn license fees from a license agreement with hgv and co-brand credit card arrangements for the use of certain hilton marks and intellectual property.
•   base and incentive management fees. represents fees received in connection with the management of hotels. terms of our management contracts vary, but our fees generally consist of a base fee, which is typically a percentage of the hotel's gross revenue and, in some cases, an incentive fee, which is based on hotel operating profits and may be subject to a stated return threshold to the owner, normally measured over a one-calendar year period. outside of the u.s., our fees are often more dependent on hotel profitability measures, either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure, or because our two-tier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee.
•   owned and leased hotels. represents revenues derived from hotel operations, including room rentals, food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services. these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers: transient and group. transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings, conferences or social functions sponsored by associations, corporate, social, military, educational, religious or other organizations. group business usually includes a block of room accommodations, as well as other ancillary services, such as meeting facilities and catering and banquet services. a majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotel properties. as a result, occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotel revenues.
•   other revenues from managed and franchised properties. these revenues represent contractual reimbursements to us by property owners for the payroll and related costs of properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility, as well as certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties' operations. we have no legal responsibility for employees at franchised properties. hotel franchisees and property owners of hotels we manage also pay a monthly fee based on a percentage of the hotel's gross room revenue, or other usage fees, which covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs; the costs of internet, technology and reservation systems; and quality assurance program expenses. the corresponding expenses incurred by us are presented as other expenses from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations, resulting in no effect on operating income (loss) or net income (loss).
•   consumer demand and global economic conditions. consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks affecting or reducing travel patterns, lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can lower the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased operations. further, competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers at our hotels. also, declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees, which is based on hotel profit measures. as a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatility.
•   contracts with third-party owners and franchisees and relationships with developers. we depend on our long-term management and franchise contracts with third-party owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchise fee revenues. the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise contracts and maintain good relationships with third-party owners and franchisees. our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth. growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees relating to hotels in the pipeline are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development, maintenance and renovation of properties. we believe that we have good relationships with our third-party owners, franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and development of these relationships. these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners, franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any particular third party.
•   owned and leased hotels. reflects the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels, including room expense, food and beverage costs, other support costs and property expenses. room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping, laundry and front desk staff, as well as supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry. food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage products. other support expenses consist of costs associated with property-level management, utilities, sales and marketing, operating hotel spas, telephones, parking and other guest recreation, entertainment and services. property expenses include property taxes, repairs and maintenance, rent and insurance.
•   depreciation and amortization. these are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of amortization of our management and franchise intangibles and capitalized software, as well as depreciation of fixed assets, such as buildings and furniture and equipment that are used in corporate operations or at our consolidated owned and leased hotels.
•   general and administrative. consists primarily of compensation expense for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments (including divisional offices that support our management and franchise segment), professional fees (including consulting, audit and legal fees), travel and entertainment expenses, bad debt expenses for uncollected management, franchise and other fees, contractual performance obligations and administrative and related expenses.
•   other expenses. consists of expenses incurred by our supply management and other ancillary businesses, along with other operating expenses of the business.
•   other expenses from managed and franchised properties. these expenses represent certain costs and expenses that are contractually reimbursed to us by property owners for payroll and related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility, or paid from fees collected in advance from properties for certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties' operations, marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services. we have no legal responsibility for employees at franchised
•   fixed expenses. many of the expenses associated with owning and leasing hotels are relatively fixed. these expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flow, margins and profits. this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchise segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel. the effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts is limited by the amount of fixed costs inherent in our business. as a result, we may not be able to fully offset revenue reductions through cost cutting. employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. in addition, any efforts to reduce costs, or to defer or cancel capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands. we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to market conditions, while continuing to optimize the overall customer experience or the value of our hotels or brands.
•   changes in depreciation and amortization expense. we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects and, as those projects are completed and placed into service, amortization expense will increase. we also capitalize cash consideration paid to incentivize hotel owners as contract acquisition costs and the costs incurred to obtain certain management and franchise contracts as development commissions. as we enter into new management and franchise contracts for which these costs are incurred and capitalized, amortization expense will also increase. additionally, changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels, acquisition or development of new hotels, the disposition of existing hotels through sale or closure or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets. as we place new assets into service, we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expense on those assets.
other items effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency, which is the u.s. dollar ("usd"), and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies. as a result, we are required to translate those results, assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at market-based exchange rates for each reporting period. when comparing our results of operations between periods, there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods. we hedge foreign exchange-based cash flow variability in certain of our foreign currency denominated management and franchise fees using forward contracts.
seasonality the lodging industry is seasonal in nature. however, the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location, type of property and competitive mix within the specific location. based on historical results, we generally expect our revenue to be lower during the first calendar quarter of each year than during each of the three subsequent quarters.
key business and financial metrics used by management comparable hotels we define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period, and open january 1st of the previous year; (ii) have not undergone a change in brand or ownership type during the current or comparable periods reported, excluding the hotels distributed in the spin-offs; and (iii) have not sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, undergone large-scale capital projects or for which
comparable results are not available. of the 5,236 hotels in our system as of december 31, 2017, 3,909 hotels have been classified as comparable hotels. our 1,327 non-comparable hotels included 284 hotels, or approximately five percent of the total hotels in our system, that were removed from the comparable group during the year because they sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, underwent large-scale capital projects or comparable results were not available.
occupancy occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels for a given period. occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels' available capacity. management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. occupancy levels also help us determine achievable average daily rate levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.
adr represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of room nights sold for a given period. adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry, and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.
revpar is calculated by dividing hotel room revenue by total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels: occupancy and adr. revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda reflects income (loss) from continuing operations, net of taxes, excluding interest expense, a provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization.
adjusted ebitda is calculated as ebitda, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including gains, losses and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions for both consolidated and unconsolidated investments; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings and retirements; (iv) furniture, fixtures and equipment ("ff&e") replacement reserves required under certain lease agreements; (v) reorganization costs; (vi) share-based compensation expense; (vii) non-cash impairment losses; (viii) severance, relocation and other expenses; and (ix) other items.
we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry. for instance, interest expense and the provision for income taxes are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, our capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively, and, therefore could vary significantly across companies. depreciation and amortization are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used. for adjusted ebitda, we also exclude items such as: (i) share-based compensation expense, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them; (ii) ff&e replacement reserve to be consistent with the treatment of ff&e for owned and leased hotels where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the ff&e; and (iii) other items that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our performance.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity
derived in accordance with gaap. ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as alternatives, either in isolation or as a substitute, for net income (loss), cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under gaap. some of these limitations are:
•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness;
•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect a provision for income taxes or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;
•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations;
•   although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
•   other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
because of these limitations, ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.
for the year ended december 31, 2017, we experienced revpar growth across all regions, particularly in asia pacific, europe and the americas (excluding u.s.). continued growth in asia pacific was primarily driven by high demand in china and japan attributable to new hotels stabilizing in the system, resulting in increased occupancy. strong performance in europe was a result of both increases in occupancy and adr, largely driven by continued recovery from the geopolitical and economic turmoil in 2016, particularly in turkey. the revpar increase in the americas (excluding u.s.) was driven by strong performance in canada and puerto rico, which was a result of strong transient and group demand and steady demand resulting from the hurricanes, respectively. mea experienced revpar growth due to increased occupancy, despite declines in adr due to travel sanctions and increased geopolitical pressures. revpar growth in the u.s. was driven by increased demand in certain markets as a result of hurricane relief efforts.
the u.s., americas and europe all experienced revpar growth as a result of adr growth, with americas (excluding u.s.) outpacing all other regions, driven by strength in canada and mexico. the asia pacific increase in revpar was driven by increased occupancy, particularly in china. mea performance continued to be negatively affected by geopolitical and terrorism concerns, resulting in a decrease in occupancy.
the table below provides a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations, net of taxes, to ebitda and adjusted ebitda:
income tax expense (benefit)                                  (334    )              564                  (348    )
ebitda                                                       1,685                 1,314                 1,295
other adjustment items(1)                                       47                    85                   109
adjusted ebitda                                             $1,965                $1,543                $1,475
(1)   includes adjustments for severance, impairment loss and other items. the year ended december 31, 2017 also includes transaction costs. transaction costs for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 are included in discontinued operations and, therefore, are excluded from the presentation above.
the increases in management and franchise fees for all periods were driven by the addition of new managed and franchised properties to our portfolio and the increases in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised hotels.
including new development and ownership type transfers, we added 744 managed and franchised properties from january 1, 2016 to december 31, 2017 and 600 managed and franchised properties from january 1, 2015 to december 31, 2016 on a net basis, providing an additional 133,921 rooms and 89,410 rooms, respectively, to our management and franchise segment. the increase from january 1, 2016 to december 31, 2017 included 67 properties that upon completion of the spin-offs were owned by park and managed or franchised by hilton. as new hotels stabilize in our system, we expect the fees received from such hotels to increase as they are part of our system for full periods. franchise fees also increased during the year ended december 31, 2017 as a result of a net increase in licensing and other fees of $148 million, which includes the effect of the license fees earned from hgv after the spin-offs.
the increases in other revenues during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 compared to the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were primarily the result of recoveries of $28 million and $9 million, respectively, from the settlement of a claim by hilton to a third party relating to our defined benefit plans.
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily a result of a decrease in amortization expense due to certain capitalized software costs being fully amortized between december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2017. the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily a result of the recognition of $13 million in accelerated amortization in 2015 on a management contract intangible asset for a property that was managed by us prior to our acquisition of it and its transfer of ownership to park upon completion of the spin-offs.
the increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of increased share-based compensation expense of $29 million mainly due to an increase in retirement eligible participants, resulting in the acceleration of expense recognition, as well as additional expense recognized from a special equity grant to certain participants in connection with the spin-offs. additionally, $18 million in costs associated with the spin-offs were incurred during the year ended december 31, 2017, while similar costs incurred during the year ended december 31, 2016 are included in discontinued operations. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of $10 million in severance costs related to the 2015 sale and continued management of the waldorf astoria new york (the "waldorf astoria new york sale").
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily a result of a decrease of $73 million in severance costs related to the waldorf astoria new york sale and a decrease in share-based compensation expense due to $61 million of additional expense recognized during the year ended december 31, 2015, when certain remaining awards granted in connection with our initial public offering vested.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on the sale of one of our hotels held by a consolidated vie. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized a gain upon completion of the sale of the hilton sydney. note 4: "disposals" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
income tax benefit (expense)                       334             (564      )             348             nm(1)                          nm(1)
the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily due to the issuances of the 4.625% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 senior notes") and the 4.875% senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 senior notes") in march 2017 and the 4.25% senior notes due 2024 (the "2024 senior notes") in august 2016, as well as the reclassification of losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the dedesignation of interest rate swaps in 2016. these increases were largely offset by decreases in interest expense due to the march 2017 repayment of the 5.625% senior notes due 2021 (the "2021 senior notes") and the refinancing of the senior secured term loan facility (the "term loans") in march 2017, which reduced the interest rate on this borrowing.
the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily due to the issuance of the 2024 senior notes, partially offset by decreases in interest expense on the term loans due to a reduction of principal from prepayments and an amendment in august 2016 that extended the maturity and reduced the interest rate on a portion of the outstanding balance. see note 9: "debt" and note 11: "derivative instruments and hedging activities" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness and interest rate swaps.
the net gain and losses on foreign currency transactions for all periods were primarily related to changes in foreign currency rates on our short-term cross-currency intercompany loans. the changes were predominantly related to loans denominated in the australian dollar ("aud"), the british pound ("gbp") and the euro for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as the brazilian real, for the year ended december 31, 2015.
the loss on debt extinguishment related to the repayment of the 2021 senior notes and included a redemption premium of $42 million and the accelerated recognition of $18 million of unamortized debt issuance costs during the year ended december 31, 2017.
other non-operating income, net increased during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily as a result of a $7 million gain recognized in 2017 related to an amendment of one of our capital leases. other non-operating income, net decreased during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily as a result of a $24 million gain recognized in 2015 related to a capital lease liability reduction from one of our consolidated vies, as well as a pre-tax gain of $8 million recognized in 2015 on a sale of assets.
on december 22, 2017, h.r.1, known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the "tcj act") was signed into law, which permanently reduces the corporate income tax rate from a graduated 35 percent to a flat 21 percent rate and imposes a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred. the income tax benefit during the year ended december 31, 2017 was primarily due to a benefit of $665 million for the estimated impact of the transition tax and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. the benefit recorded as a result of the provisions of the tcj act represents management's best estimates of the effect to the current period and are subject to refinement and revision over a one-year period, to be finalized in or before december 2018. this benefit was partially offset by an increase in tax expense attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes compared to the year ended december 31, 2016.
income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily as a result of two corporate structuring transactions that were effected during the year ended december 31, 2016 and included: (i) the organization of hilton's assets and subsidiaries in preparation for the spin-offs; and (ii) a restructuring of hilton's international assets and subsidiaries (the "international restructuring"). the international restructuring involved a transfer of certain assets, including intellectual property used in the international business, from u.s. subsidiaries to foreign subsidiaries and became effective in december 2016. the transfer of the intellectual property resulted in the recognition of tax expense representing the estimated u.s. tax expected to be paid in future years on income generated from the intellectual property transferred to foreign subsidiaries. further, our deferred effective tax rate is determined based upon the composition of applicable federal and state tax rates. due to the changes in the footprint of the company and the expected applicable tax rates at which our domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse in future periods as a result of the described structuring activities, our estimated deferred effective tax rate increased. in total, these structuring transactions resulted in additional income tax expense of $482 million during the year ended december 31, 2016. see note 14: "income taxes" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
segment results we evaluate our business segment operating performance using operating income. refer to note 19: "business segments" in our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating income to income from continuing operations before income taxes and additional information on the evaluation of the performance of our segments using operating income. the following table sets forth revenues and operating income by segment:
management and franchise segment revenues and operating income increased for all periods primarily as a result of the net addition of hotels to our managed and franchised system, as well as increases in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised properties of 2.4 percent and 2.0 percent for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 compared to the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016, the increase in management and franchise segment revenues and operating income was also due to an increase in licensing and other fees. refer to "-revenues" for further discussion of the increases in revenues from our managed and franchised properties.
liquidity and capital resources overview as of december 31, 2017, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $670 million, including $100 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents balance related to cash collateral on our self-insurance programs.
our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including costs associated with the management and franchising of hotels, corporate expenses, payroll and related benefits, legal costs, interest and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, contract acquisition costs and capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at the hotels within our ownership segment. our long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities, capital improvements to the hotels within our ownership segment, commitments to owners in our management and franchise segment, dividends as declared, share repurchases and corporate capital expenditures.
we finance our business activities primarily with existing cash and cash generated from our operations. we believe that this cash will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and related benefits, legal costs and other commitments for the foreseeable future. the objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain the availability of liquidity and minimize operational costs. further, we have an investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders.
we and our affiliates may from time to time purchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. purchases or retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
in february 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of the company's common stock and, in november 2017, an additional $1.0 billion was authorized. during the year ended december 31, 2017, we repurchased $891 million of common stock under the program, and, as of december 31, 2017, $1,109 million remained available for share repurchases. the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

(1)   includes the cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities of hilton, park and hgv.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities were primarily generated from management and franchise fee revenue and operating income from our owned and leased hotels and, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, sales of timeshare units.
the $441 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily as a result of a decrease in operating income from our owned and leased properties and sales of timeshare units as a result of the spin-offs.
the $81 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily as a result of an increase in net cash paid for income taxes of $202 million, partially offset by the improved operating results of our management and franchise segment and hgv's timeshare business.
investing activities for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures for property and equipment, contract acquisition costs and capitalized software costs.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we generated cash from investing activities primarily as a result of net proceeds from the waldorf astoria new york sale, completed for the benefit of park, and the sale of the hilton sydney of $456 million and $331 million, respectively. this amount was partially offset by $409 million in capital expenditures for property and equipment, contract acquisition costs and capitalized software costs.
our capital expenditures for property and equipment primarily consisted of expenditures related to our corporate facilities and the renovation of hotels in our ownership segment which, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, included those owned by park following completion of the spin-offs. our capitalized software costs related to various systems initiatives for
the benefit of our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations. our contract acquisition costs were incurred to incentivize hotel owners to enter into management and franchise contracts with us.
financing activities the $1,680 million increase in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily the result of cash transferred in connection with the spin-offs and $1.1 billion of capital returned to our stockholders, which includes dividends and share repurchases, compared to $277 million in 2016. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2017, we received $1.5 billion in proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 senior notes and the 2027 senior notes, which we used with available cash to repay in full our 2021 senior notes, including a redemption premium of $42 million.
the $1,709 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from borrowings of $4,667 million, partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt of $2,735 million, which were completed in preparation for the spin-offs, and an increase in cash dividends of $139 million. the borrowings comprised $4,415 million of long-term debt, of which $2,915 million was for park and $800 million was for hgv. we used proceeds from the borrowings and available cash to repay the outstanding balance of park's commercial mortgage backed securities loan of $3,418 million, $550 million of park's mortgage loans and $250 million on our term loans. the increase in cash dividends was due to the declaration of quarterly cash dividends beginning in the third quarter of 2015 and continuing quarterly for the full year of 2016.
debt and borrowing capacity as of december 31, 2017, our total indebtedness, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discount, was approximately $6.7 billion. for further information on our total indebtedness, debt issuances and repayments and guarantees on our debt, refer to note 9: "debt" and note 23: "condensed consolidating guarantor financial information" in our consolidated financial statements.
our senior revolving credit facility provides for $1.0 billion in borrowings, including the ability to draw up to $150 million in the form of letters of credit. as of december 31, 2017, we had $41 million of letters of credit outstanding, leaving us with a borrowing capacity of $959 million. the maturities of the letters of credit were within one year as of december 31, 2017, and the majority of them related to our self-insurance programs.
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to reduce capital expenditures, issue additional equity securities or draw on our senior secured revolving credit facility. our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance, which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control.

the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2017 was $283 million. this amount is excluded from the table above because these unrecognized tax benefits are uncertain and subject to the findings of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax. it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could
change during the next year. refer to note 14: "income taxes" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
in addition to the purchase commitments in the table above, in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments for which we are reimbursed by the owners of our managed and franchised hotels. these obligations have minimal or no effect on our net income (loss) and cash flows.
off-balance sheet arrangements our off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2017 included letters of credit of $41 million and performance guarantees with possible cash outlays of approximately $79 million, for which we accrued $21 million as of december 31, 2017 for estimated probable exposure. see note 20: "commitments and contingencies" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. we believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 2: "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment, and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain. as a result, these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances. while we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise, which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment annually and at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist. when using the quantitative process to evaluate goodwill for potential impairment, consistent with our early adoption of asu no. 2017-04 in january 2017, we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. when determining the estimated fair value, we utilize discounted future cash flow models, as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units. under the discounted cash flow approach, we utilize various assumptions that require judgment, including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated long-term growth rates, and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital. our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, as well as various internal projections and external sources. the weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on each reporting units' cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure. the selected capital structure for each reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comparable publicly traded companies operating in the business of that reporting unit.
we had $5,190 million of goodwill as of december 31, 2017. changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses, which could be material. additionally, when a portion of a reporting unit is disposed, goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair values of the business or businesses disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. when determining fair value of the businesses disposed of and the reporting unit to be retained, we use estimates and assumptions similar to those used in our impairment analysis.
brands we evaluate our brands intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value. when determining the fair value, we utilize discounted future cash flow models. under the discounted cash flow approach, we utilize various assumptions that require judgment, including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated long-term
growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital. our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, as well as various internal estimates.
intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment we evaluate the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of impairment.
•   determine if there are indicators of impairment present. factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy and regional performance and expectations, historical experience, capital costs and other asset-specific information;
•   determine the asset fair value when required. in determining the fair value, we often use internally-developed discounted cash flow models. assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows, which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions, as well as capitalization rates, which are based on location, property or asset type, market-specific dynamics and overall economic performance. the discount rate takes into account our weighted average cost of capital according to our capital structure and other market specific considerations.
we had $1,342 million of intangible assets with finite lives and $353 million of property and equipment, net as of december 31, 2017. changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of intangible assets with finite lives and property and equipment could result in future impairment losses, which could be material.
we had a guest loyalty program liability of $1,461 million as of december 31, 2017, including $622 million reflected as a current liability in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other. changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate or other expected future program operations could result in a material change to the guest loyalty program liability.
income taxes on december 22, 2017, the tcj act was signed into law and includes widespread changes to the internal revenue code including, among other items, a reduction to the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign earnings. as of december 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the tcj act; however, where possible, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. in other cases, we were not able to make a reasonable estimate and continued to account for those items based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment. see note 14: "income taxes" for additional discussion on the provisional effects of the tcj act.
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. in performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
we use a prescribed more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. when determining the amount of tax benefit to be recognized, we assume, among other items, the position will be examined, the examiner will have all relevant information and the evaluation of the position should be based on its technical merits. further, estimates based on the tax position's technical merits and amounts we would ultimately accept in a negotiated settlement with the tax authorities, are used to measure the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit (expense), which can materially change our consolidated financial statements.
legal contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required when we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
consolidations we use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity, including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights, as well as financial interests in an entity that are not controllable through voting interests. if an entity in which we hold an interest is considered to be a vie, we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary, and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary. if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie, we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interest in the entity. changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
share-based compensation the process of estimating the fair value of share-based compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant estimates and assumptions made by management. refer to note 16: "share-based compensation" in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. any changes to these estimates will affect the amount of share-based compensation expense we recognize with respect to future grants. additionally, since we determined that the performance condition for our performance awards is probable of achievement, we recognize expense based on anticipated achievement percentages, which are based on internally-developed projections of future adjusted ebitda and free cash flow per share. any changes to these estimates will affect the amount of share-based compensation expense we recognize in future periods.

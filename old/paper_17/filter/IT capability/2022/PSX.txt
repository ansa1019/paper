item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form 10-k. each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in our common stock. these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations.
risks related to our manufacturing and operations our financial results are affected by changing commodity prices and margins for refined petroleum, petrochemical and plastics products.
the costs of feedstocks and the prices at which we can ultimately sell our products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply and demand, which are subject to, among other things, production levels, levels of refined petroleum product inventories, productivity and growth of economies, and governmental regulation. we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude we process. the prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products can fluctuate based on global, regional and local market conditions, as well as by type and class of products, which can reduce margins and have a significant impact on our refining, wholesale marketing and retail operations, revenues, operating income and cash flows. also, crude oil supply contracts generally have market-based pricing provisions. we normally purchase our refinery feedstocks weeks before manufacturing and selling the refined petroleum products. we also purchase refined petroleum products produced by others for sale to our customers. changes in prices that occur between the time we purchase feedstocks or products and when we sell the refined petroleum products could have a significant effect on our financial results.
the price of crude oil also influences prices for petrochemical and plastics products and the feedstocks used to manufacture the products. our chemicals segment uses feedstocks that are derivatively produced in the refining of crude oil and the processing of natural gas, and those feedstock prices can fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in worldwide energy prices and the supply and availability of the feedstocks. due to the highly competitive nature of most of the products sold by our chemicals segment, market position cannot necessarily be protected by product differentiation or by passing on cost increases to customers. as a result, price increases in raw materials may not correlate with changes in the prices at which petrochemical and plastics products are sold, thereby negatively affecting margins and the results of operations of our chemicals segment.
sustained or prolonged declines in commodity prices and margins for our products may adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, access to the capital markets, and our ability to fund our capital priorities, including share repurchases and dividends.
market conditions, including commodity prices, may impact the earnings, financial condition and cash flows of our midstream business.
our midstream business is affected by the price of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and ngl, which have historically been volatile. the prices for crude oil, natural gas and ngl depend upon factors beyond our control, including global and local demand, production levels, imports and exports, seasonality and weather conditions, economic and political conditions domestically and internationally, and governmental regulations. decreases in energy prices can decrease drilling activity, production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves. sustained periods of low prices can also cause producers to significantly curtail or limit their oil and gas drilling operations, which could substantially delay the production and delivery of volumes of crude oil, natural gas and ngl.
index to financial statements the volume of crude oil and refined petroleum products transported or stored in our pipelines and terminal facilities depends on the demand for and availability of crude oil and refined petroleum products in the areas serviced by our assets. a period of sustained low demand or prices for crude oil could lead to a decline in drilling activity and production, which would lead to a decrease in the volumes of crude oil transported through our pipelines and terminal facilities, negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows. likewise, our earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted by a period of sustained lower demand for refined petroleum products, which could lead to lower refinery utilization and result in a decrease in the volumes of refined petroleum product transported through our pipelines and terminal facilities.
the natural gas gathered, processed, transported, sold and stored by us is delivered into pipelines for further delivery to end-users, including fractionation facilities. demand for these services may be substantially reduced due to lower rates of natural gas production as a result of declining commodity prices. commodity prices, including when ethane prices are low relative to natural gas prices, can also negatively impact throughput volumes of ngl transported, fractionated and stored. additionally, revenues and cash flows can increase or decrease as the price of natural gas and ngl fluctuates because of certain contractual arrangements whereby natural gas is purchased for an agreed percentage of proceeds from the sale of the residue gas and/or ngl resulting from its processing activities.
additionally, the level of production from natural gas wells will naturally decline over time. in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on our gathering and transportation pipeline systems and ngl pipelines and the asset utilization rates at our natural gas processing plants, we must continually obtain new supplies. the level of successful drilling activity and prices of, and demand for, natural gas and crude oil, as well as producers' desire and ability to obtain necessary permits are some of the factors that may affect new supplies of natural gas and ngl. if we are not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells or because of competition, throughput on our pipelines and the utilization rates of our treating and processing facilities would decline. this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and our ability to make cash distributions.
our operations are subject to planned and unplanned downtime, business interruptions, and operational hazards, any of which could adversely impact our ability to operate and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our operating results are largely dependent on the continued operation of facilities and assets owned and operated by us and our equity affiliates. interruptions may materially reduce productivity and thus, the profitability, of operations during and after downtime, including for planned turnarounds and scheduled maintenance activities. in the past, we and certain of our equity affiliates also have temporarily shut down facilities due to the threat of severe weather, such as hurricanes. additionally, the availability of natural gas and electricity necessary to operate our assets can be affected by weather, pipeline interruptions, grid outages, and logistics disruptions, which may also cause us to temporarily curtail or shut down operations. although we take precautions to ensure and enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are also subject to hazards inherent in chemicals, refining and midstream businesses, such as explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents, power outages, labor disputes, restrictive governmental regulation or other natural or man-made disasters, such as geopolitical conflicts and acts of terrorism, including cyber intrusion. the inability to operate facilities or assets due to any of these events could significantly impair our ability to manufacture, process, store or transport products.
any casualty occurrence involving our assets or operations could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property and equipment, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial losses to us. for assets located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater. damages resulting from an incident involving any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially substantial claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities. should any of these risks materialize at any of our equity affiliates, it could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the equity affiliate and negatively impact their ability to make future distributions to us.
we often utilize the services of third parties to transport crude oil, ngl and refined petroleum products to and from our facilities. in addition to our own operational risks, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined petroleum products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport crude oil or refined petroleum products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions. a prolonged disruption of the ability of a pipeline or vessel to transport crude oil, ngl or refined petroleum products to or from one or more of our refineries or other facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as covid-19. the covid-19 pandemic and the associated containment efforts had a serious adverse impact on the economy and a material adverse effect on our business, as the demand for crude oil, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel and other refined products was significantly reduced.
even if a virus or other illness does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may result in reduced demand for our products and materially affect our business. as we cannot predict the duration or scope of any public health crisis, epidemic or pandemic, the negative financial impact to our results cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material. factors that will influence the impact on our business and operations include the duration and extent of such events, including the virulence of the infection, the timing of vaccine development and distribution across the world and its impact on economic recovery, the extent of imposed or recommended containment and mitigation measures and their impact on our operations, and the general economic consequences of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, such as the covid-19 pandemic.
to the extent any public health crisis, epidemic or pandemic adversely affected or affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks that could adversely affect our business described below, such as risks associated with industry capacity utilization, volatility in the price and availability of raw materials, material adverse changes in customer relationships including any failure of a customer to perform its obligations under agreements with us, and risks associated with worldwide or regional economic conditions.
competition risks refining and marketing competitors that produce their own feedstocks, have more extensive retail outlets, or have greater financial resources may have a competitive advantage.
the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets. we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for our refined petroleum products. we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. some of our competitors, however, obtain a portion of their feedstocks from their own production and some have more extensive retail outlets than we have. competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets (and greater brand-name recognition) are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.
some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all aspects of our business. in addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual customers.
index to financial statements volatility in market demand for our petrochemical and plastics products and midstream transportation services and the risk of overbuild in these industries could negatively impact the results of operations of our businesses.
we and our equity affiliates have made and continue to make significant investments to meet market demand for our products and services, such as investments in midstream infrastructure and construction of new petrochemicals facilities. similar investments have been made, and additional investments may be made in the future, by us, our competitors or by new entrants to the markets and industries we serve. the success of these investments largely depends on the realization of anticipated market demand, and these projects typically require significant development periods, during which time demand for our products or services may change, or additional investments by competitors may be made that could result in an overbuild of supply. any of these or other competitive forces could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our return on capital employed.
strategic performance and future growth risks large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate significantly between the project approval date and the project startup date, negatively impacting expected project returns.
our basis for approving a large-scale capital project is the expectation that it will deliver an acceptable rate of return on the capital invested. we base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions including the regulatory and operating environment. for example, we are in the process of converting our san francisco refinery into a renewable fuels facility to meet growing demand for renewable fuels. most large-scale projects take several years to complete. during this multiyear period, market conditions can change from those we forecast, and these changes could be significant. accordingly, we may not be able to realize our expected returns from a large investment in a capital project, and this could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and our return on capital employed.
plans we or our joint ventures may have to expand or construct assets or develop new technologies, and plans for our future performance are subject to risks associated with societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition to the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. such risks could adversely impact our results of operations.
certain of our plans are based upon the assumption that societal sentiment will continue to enable, and existing regulations will remain in place to allow for, the future development, transportation and use of carbon-based fuels. a portion of our growth strategy is dependent on our and our joint ventures' ability to capture growth opportunities in the midstream and chemicals segments. policy decisions relating to the production, refining, transportation, marketing and use of carbon-based fuels are subject to political pressures and the influence and protests of environmental and other special interest groups. for example, the construction or expansion of pipelines can involve numerous regulatory, permitting, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. we may not be able to identify or execute growth projects, and those that are identified may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost, if at all. in addition, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs or the inability to complete growth projects could negatively impact our reputation, results of operations, cash flows and our return on capital employed.
in addition, our energy research & innovation organization works to develop new technologies focused on advancing our business, including renewable fuels research and energy transition programs. our efforts to research and develop new technologies is subject to a multitude of factors and conditions, many of which are out of our control. examples of such factors include evolving government regulation, the pace of changes in technology, the successful development and deployment of existing or new technologies and business solutions on a commercial scale, competition from third parties in developing new technologies and the availability, timing and cost of equipment.
index to financial statements political and economic developments could affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.
actions of federal, state, local and international governments through legislation or regulation, executive order, permit or other review of infrastructure or facility development, and commercial restrictions could delay projects, increase costs, limit development, or otherwise reduce our profitability both in the united states and abroad. any such actions may affect many aspects of our operations, including:
•requiring permits or other approvals that may impose unforeseen or unduly burdensome conditions or potentially cause delays in our operations.
•further limiting or prohibiting construction or other activities in environmentally sensitive or other areas.
•requiring increased capital costs to construct, maintain or upgrade equipment, facilities or infrastructure.
•restricting the locations where we may construct facilities or requiring the relocation of facilities.
in addition, the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries and from doing business with entities affiliated with foreign governments, which can include state oil companies and u.s. subsidiaries of those companies. the office of foreign assets control (ofac) of the u.s. department of the treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on u.s. foreign policy and national security matters. the effect of any such ofac sanctions could disrupt transactions with or operations involving entities affiliated with sanctioned countries, and could limit our ability to obtain optimum crude slates and other refinery feedstocks and effectively distribute refined petroleum products.
other political and economic risks include global pandemics; financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations; short-term and long-term inflationary pressures; import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations; supply chain disruptions; acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks; limitations in the availability of labor to develop, staff and manage operations; and potentially adverse tax developments. if any of these events occur, our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected.
we may not be able to effectively identify, whether through acquisition, investment or development, lower-carbon opportunities on favorable terms, or at all, and failure to do so could limit our growth, our ability to participate in the energy transition, and our ability to meet our environmental goals and targets.
part of our strategy includes capturing growth opportunities in our emerging energy business to further advance our participation in the energy transition and meet our greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions reduction targets. this strategy depends on our ability to successfully identify and evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities or develop and commercialize new technologies. the number of lower-carbon opportunities may be limited, and we will compete with other energy companies for these limited opportunities, which could make them more expensive and the returns for our business less attractive and possibly cause us to refrain from making them at all.  further, certain lower-carbon opportunities will depend on technological and other advancements that may not be within our control and may not come to fruition or be economically feasible in the near term. any new opportunities also may depend on the viability of new assets or businesses that are contingent on public policy mechanisms including investment tax credits, subsidies, renewable portfolio standards and carbon trading plans. these mechanisms have been implemented at the state and federal levels to support the development of renewable energy, demand-side, and other clean infrastructure technologies. the availability and continuation of public policy support mechanisms will drive a significant part of the economics and viability of lower-carbon and clean energy investments generally, as well as our participation in them. if we are unable to identify and consummate acquisitions and investments, our ability to execute a portion of our growth strategy and meet our environmental goals may be impeded.
index to financial statements regulatory and environmental, climate and weather risks climate change and severe weather may adversely affect our and our joint ventures' facilities and ongoing operations.
the potential physical effects of climate change and severe weather, as well as other chronic physical effects such as water shortages and rising sea levels, on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present. we have systems in place to manage potential acute physical risks, including those that may be caused by climate change, but if any such events were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. examples of potential physical risks include floods, hurricane-force winds, wildfires, freezing temperatures and snowstorms, as well as rising sea levels at our coastal facilities. we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to protect our assets from physical risks and to employ processes, to the extent available, to mitigate such risks.
we operate facilities located in coastal regions of the united states, which have been impacted by hurricanes that have required us to temporarily, or even permanently, shut down operations at those sites. for example, due to significant damages from hurricane ida, we shut down the alliance refinery. cpchem also operates facilities on the gulf coast and has had to temporarily shut down sites in the past as a result of hurricanes. any extreme weather events or rising sea levels may disrupt the ability to operate our facilities located near coastal areas or to transport crude oil, refined petroleum or petrochemical and plastics products in these areas. extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. we could also incur substantial costs to prevent or repair damage to these facilities. finally, depending on the severity and duration of any extreme weather events or climate conditions, our operations may need to be modified and material costs incurred, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the operation of refineries, power plants, fractionators, pipelines, terminals, gas processing facilities and vessels is inherently subject to the risks of spills, discharges or other inadvertent releases of petroleum or hazardous substances. if any of these events had previously occurred or occurs in the future in connection with any of our refineries, pipelines or refined petroleum products terminals, or in connection with any facilities that receive our wastes or byproducts for treatment or disposal, other than events for which we are indemnified, we could be liable for all costs and penalties associated with their remediation under federal, state, local and international environmental laws or common law, and could be liable for property damage to third parties caused by contamination from releases and spills.
we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.
our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. these laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:
•emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, and ghg emissions, as they are, or may become, regulated.
•the quantity of renewable fuels that must be blended into motor fuels.
•the dismantlement and abandonment of our facilities and restoration of our properties at the end of their useful lives.
index to financial statements to the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods could be materially adversely affected.
currently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address ghg and other emissions are in various phases of consideration, promulgation or implementation. these include actions to develop international, federal, regional or statewide programs, which could require reductions in our ghg or other emissions, establish a carbon tax and decrease the demand for our refined products. requiring reductions in these emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.
for example, in 2017, the california state legislature adopted assembly bill 398, which provides direction and parameters on utilizing cap and trade after 2020 to meet the 40% reduction target for ghg emissions from 1990 levels by 2030 specified in senate bill 32. compliance with the cap and trade program is demonstrated through a market-based credit system. additionally, on august 25, 2022, the california air resources board (carb) adopted regulations that effectively ban the in-state sales of new cars containing internal combustion engines beginning in 2035. also, on december 15, 2022, carb adopted its "2022 scoping plan for achieving carbon neutrality," which purports to provide a road map for california to achieve carbon neutrality (which it defines as removing as many carbon emissions from the atmosphere as it emits) by year 2045. other states are proposing, or have already promulgated, low carbon fuel standards or similar initiatives to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. if we are unable to pass the costs of compliance on to our customers, sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase, we have to pay a significantly higher price for credits, or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligation, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
federal, regional and state climate change and air emissions goals and regulatory programs are complex, subject to change and impose considerable uncertainty due to a number of factors including technological feasibility, legal challenges and potential changes in federal policy. increasing concerns about climate change and carbon intensity have also resulted in heightened societal awareness and a number of international and national measures to limit ghg emissions. additional stricter regulatory measures and investor pressure can be expected in the future and any of these changes may have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition.
international climate change-related efforts, such as the 2015 united nations conference on climate change, which led to the creation of the paris agreement, may impact the regulatory framework of states whose policies directly influence our present and future operations. although the united states had previously withdrawn from the paris agreement, it has since taken the steps necessary to rejoin, which was effective in february 2021. the u.s. climate change strategy and the impact to our industry and operations due to ghg regulation is unknown at this time.
increased regulation of the fossil fuel industry, particularly with respect to hydraulic fracturing, could result in reductions or delays in u.s. production of crude oil and natural gas, which could adversely impact our results of operations.
most of the crude oil and gas production of our midstream segment's customers is being produced from unconventional oil shale reservoirs. these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the hydrocarbons from the rock so they can flow through casing to the surface. hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to stimulate hydrocarbon production. the epa, as well as several state agencies, have commenced studies and/or convened hearings regarding the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities. at the same time, certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and legislation has been proposed to provide for such regulation. in addition, some communities have adopted measures to ban hydraulic fracturing in their communities.
index to financial statements also, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict crude oil and natural gas development generally. if ballot initiatives, local, state, or national restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of crude oil and natural gas, producers may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities. in addition to these proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments, municipalities, such as the city of los angeles, have already enacted or contemplate enacting complete or partial bans on oil and gas exploration and production activities.
if legislative and regulatory initiatives cause a material decrease in the drilling of new wells and related servicing activities, it may reduce crude oil, natural gas and ngl supplies, negatively affecting the volume of products available to our midstream segment and increasing feedstock prices for our chemicals and refining segments, resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
compliance with the epa's renewable fuel standard (rfs) could adversely affect our financial results.
the epa has implemented the rfs pursuant to the energy policy act of 2005 and the energy independence and security act of 2007. the rfs program sets annual renewable volume obligation (rvo) requirements for the quantity of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the united states. to provide certain flexibility in compliance options available to the industry, a renewable identification number (rin) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in, or imported into, the united states. as a producer of petroleum-based motor fuels, we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the epa's rvo requirements and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase rins in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the rfs program.
we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of rins. we cannot predict the future prices of rins. rins prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including epa regulations, the availability of rins for purchase, and levels of transportation fuels produced, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. if sufficient rins are unavailable for purchase, if we have to pay a significantly higher price for rins, if we purchase rins that are ultimately determined to be invalid, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the epa's rvo requirements, including because the epa mandates a blending quantity of renewable fuel that exceeds the amount that is commercially feasible to blend into motor fuel (a situation commonly referred to as "the blend wall"), our operations could be materially adversely impacted, up to and including a reduction in produced motor fuel for sale in the united states.
societal, technological, political and scientific developments around emissions and fuel efficiency may decrease demand for transportation fuels.
developments aimed at reducing ghg emissions may decrease the demand or increase the cost for our transportation fuels. societal attitudes toward these products and their relationship to the environment may significantly affect our effectiveness in marketing our products. government efforts to steer the public toward non-petroleum-based fuel dependent modes of transportation may foster a negative perception toward transportation fuels or increase costs of our products, thus affecting the public's attitude toward our major product. advanced technology and increased use of vehicles that do not use petroleum-based transportation fuels or that are powered by hybrid engines would reduce demand for motor fuel. we may also incur increased production costs, which we may not be able to pass along to our customers.
additionally, renewable fuels, alternative energy mandates and energy conservation efforts could reduce demand for refined petroleum products. tax incentives and other subsidies can make renewable fuels and alternative energy more competitive with refined petroleum products than they otherwise might be, which may reduce refined petroleum product margins and hinder the ability of refined petroleum products to compete with renewable fuels.
these developments could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
index to financial statements continuing political and social concerns about the issues of climate change may result in changes to our business and significant expenditures, including litigation-related expenses.
increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in increased investor attention and an increased risk of public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. for example, shareholder activism has recently been increasing in our industry, and shareholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. additionally, cities, counties, and other governmental entities in several states in the u.s. began filing lawsuits against energy companies in 2017, including phillips 66. the lawsuits seek damages allegedly associated with climate change, and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. while we believe these lawsuits are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against them for lacking factual and legal merit, the ultimate outcome and impact to us of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and we could incur substantial legal costs associated with defending these and similar lawsuits in the future. additionally, governments and private parties are also increasingly filing lawsuits or initiating regulatory action based on allegations that certain public statements regarding climate change and other environmental, social and corporate governance (esg) related matters and practices by companies are false and misleading "greenwashing" that violate deceptive trade practices and consumer protection statutes. while we are currently not a party to any of these lawsuits, they present a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent to which energy companies face an increased risk of liability stemming from climate change or esg disclosures and practices. any of these risks could result in unexpected costs, negative sentiments about our company, disruptions in our operations, increases to our operating expenses and reduced demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
increased concerns regarding plastic waste in the environment, consumers selectively reducing their consumption of plastic products due to recycling concerns, or new or more restrictive regulations and rules related to plastic waste could reduce demand for cpchem's plastic products and could negatively impact our equity interest.
there is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic, including microplastics, and other packaging waste in the environment. additionally, plastics have recently faced increased public backlash and scrutiny. policy measures to address this concern are being discussed or implemented by governments at all levels. in addition, a host of single-use plastic bans and taxes have been passed by countries around the world and counties and municipalities throughout the u.s. increased regulation of, or prohibition on, the use of certain plastic products could reduce demand for certain of the products cpchem produces, which could negatively impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, thereby negatively impacting our equity earnings, and cash distributions that we receive, from cpchem.
cybersecurity and data privacy risks security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.
our information technology and infrastructure, or information technology and infrastructure of our third-party service providers (e.g., cloud-based service providers), may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors or breached due to human error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including ransomware and other malware, phishing and social engineering schemes. any such breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in one or more of the following outcomes: (i) a loss of intellectual property, proprietary information, or employee, customer or vendor data; (ii) public disclosure of sensitive information; (iii) increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity events, such as deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants; (iv) systems interruption; (v) disruption of our business operations; (vi) remediation costs for repairs of system damage; (vii) reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence; and (viii) damage to our competitiveness, stock price, and long-term stockholder value. although we have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, we do not believe that any of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or financial condition.
index to financial statements a breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders, employees, customers, vendors, and governmental authorities (u.s. and non-u.s.). our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans may not be able to prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyberattacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention. to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.
increasing regulatory focus on privacy and cybersecurity issues and expanding laws could expose us to increased liability, subject us to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business.
along with our own data and information collected in the normal course of our business, we and our partners collect and retain certain data that is subject to specific laws and regulations. the transfer and use of this data both domestically and across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. this data is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state, international, national, provincial and local levels in many areas of our business, including data privacy and security laws such as the european union (eu) general data protection regulation (gdpr) and the california consumer privacy act (ccpa).
the gdpr applies to activities related to personal data that are conducted from an establishment in the eu. as interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to incur additional costs. failure to comply could result in significant penalties that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows.
the ccpa, which came into effect on january 1, 2020, gives california residents specific rights in relation to their personal information, requires that companies take certain actions, including notifications for security incidents and may apply to activities regarding personal information that is collected by us, directly or indirectly, from california residents. as interpretation and enforcement of the ccpa evolves, it creates a range of new compliance obligations, with the possibility for significant financial penalties for noncompliance that may materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, and cash flows.
comprehensive privacy laws with some similarities to the ccpa have been proposed or passed at the u.s. federal and state levels, such as the colorado privacy act. additionally, the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data as well as requiring disclosures about these practices. existing data privacy laws, or any laws that may become applicable to our business, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us. additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.
risks related to our equity investments and pending merger our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.
we conduct some of our operations, including parts of our midstream, refining and marketing and specialties (m&s) segments, and our entire chemicals segment, through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture partners. our joint venture partners may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or those of the joint venture, or our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations, and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.
index to financial statements one of our subsidiaries serves as the managing member of the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership (mlp), dcp lp, which may increase our exposure to legal liability, including with respect to our pending acquisition of the publicly held common units of dcp lp.
one of our subsidiaries acts as the managing member of the general partner of dcp lp, a publicly traded mlp, and is responsible for conducting, directing and managing all activities associated with dcp lp. our control of the activities of dcp lp may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest, related to dcp lp.
additionally, our control of the general partner of dcp lp increases the possibility that we and the officers and directors of the general partner of dcp lp could be subject to litigation related to the pending acquisition of the publicly held common units of dcp lp. while we will evaluate and defend against any lawsuits vigorously, an unfavorable resolution of any such lawsuit could delay or prevent the consummation of this transaction and the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the integration of dcp lp's operations into phillips 66 may not be as successful as anticipated, and phillips 66 may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the integration.
•the inability to successfully integrate the businesses of dcp lp into phillips 66 in a manner that permits phillips 66 to achieve the full revenue, cost savings and synergies anticipated;
•complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, integrated business;
•integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high‐quality products and services;
•integrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners;
indebtedness, capital markets and financial risks uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners.
our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets, which is beyond our control. our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, access to those markets, which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. in addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity transaction counterparties, or our customers, preventing them from meeting their obligations to us.
index to financial statements from time to time, our cash needs may exceed our cash from our consolidated operations and joint venture distributions, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. from time to time, we may need to supplement cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities that are supported by a broad syndicate of financial institutions. accordingly, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
investor sentiment towards climate change, fossil fuels and sustainability could adversely affect our business, the market price for our common stock and our access to and cost of capital.
there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities, and other groups, to promote the divestment of energy companies, as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies. if these efforts are successful, our stock price, our ability to access capital markets and our cost of capital may be negatively impacted.
members of the investment community are also increasing their focus on sustainability practices, including practices related to ghg emissions, climate change, diversity and inclusion, environmental justice and other sustainability-related matters. as a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our sustainability disclosures and practices. additionally, members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance before investing in our stock or participating in our financing activities. if we are unable to meet the sustainability standards set by these investors, we may lose investors, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our access to capital markets and lenders may be curtailed, and our reputation may be negatively affected.
our efforts to accurately report on sustainability-related issues expose us to operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. standards for tracking and reporting on sustainability-related matters, including climate-related matters, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. processes and controls for reporting on sustainability matters are subject to evolving and disparate standards of identification, measurement, and reporting on such metrics, including any climate change and sustainability-related public company disclosure requirements adopted by the sec, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current sustainability practices and disclosures.
we do not fully insure against all potential losses, including those from extreme weather events, and, therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected or underinsured liabilities and increased costs.
we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent, including against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards. uninsured or underinsured liabilities arising from operating hazards, including but not limited to, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations, including weather events, could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
index to financial statements deterioration in our credit profile could increase our costs of borrowing money, limit our access to the capital markets and commercial credit, and could trigger co-venturer rights under joint venture arrangements.
our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. if a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, and our funding sources could decrease.
in addition, a failure by phillips 66 to maintain an investment grade rating could affect its business relationships with suppliers and operating partners. for example, phillips 66's agreement with chevron corporation (chevron) regarding cpchem permits chevron to buy phillips 66's 50% interest in cpchem for fair market value if phillips 66 experiences a change in control or if both standard & poor's financial services llc and moody's investors service, inc. lower its credit ratings below investment grade and the credit rating from either rating agency remains below investment grade for 365 days thereafter, with fair market value determined by agreement or by nationally recognized investment banks. as a result of these factors, a downgrade of credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on phillips 66's future operations and financial position.
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the expected return on plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us based on a variety of independent sources of market information and in consultation with outside actuaries. if we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or health care cost trend rate, our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase. in addition, several factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions that we use. funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant regulations. future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be affected by legislation enacted by governmental authorities.
we currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to use them in the future. if the instruments we utilize to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. derivative transactions involve the risk that counterparties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. the risk of counterparty default is heightened in a poor economic environment. in addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us.
we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of conocophillips following the separation. further, conocophillips has indemnified us for certain matters, but may not be able to satisfy its obligations to us in the future.
in connection with our separation from conocophillips, we entered into an indemnification and release agreement and certain other agreements pursuant to which conocophillips agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify conocophillips for certain liabilities. indemnities that we may be required to provide are not subject to any cap and may be significant. third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conocophillips has agreed to retain. further, the indemnity from conocophillips may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and conocophillips may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis is the company's analysis of its financial performance and financial condition, and of significant trends that may affect future performance. it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

index to financial statements dcp lp public common unit acquisition agreement on january 5, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement with dcp lp, its subsidiaries and its general partner entities, pursuant to which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries will merge with and into dcp lp, with dcp lp surviving as a delaware limited partnership. under the terms of the agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each publicly held common unit representing a limited partner interest in dcp lp (other than the common units owned by dcp lp and dcp midstream gp, lp) issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into the right to receive $41.75 per common unit in cash, without interest. the merger will increase our economic interest in dcp lp from 43.3% to 86.8%. the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. the transaction was unanimously approved by the board of the general partner of dcp lp, based on the unanimous approval and recommendation of its special committee comprised entirely of independent directors after evaluation of the transaction by the special committee in consultation with independent financial and legal advisors. concurrently with the execution of the agreement, affiliates of phillips 66, which together own greater than a majority of the outstanding dcp lp common units, delivered their consent to approve the transaction. as a result, dcp lp has not solicited and is not soliciting approval of the transaction by any other holders of dcp lp common units. see note 29-dcp midstream class a segment, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on the common unit acquisition agreement.

we continue to focus on the following strategic priorities:
•operating excellence. our commitment to operating excellence guides everything we do. we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations and the communities in which we operate. continuous improvement in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability and cost efficiency is a fundamental requirement for our company and employees. we employ rigorous training and audit programs to drive ongoing improvement in both personal and process safety as we strive for zero incidents. in 2022, we achieved a combined workforce total recordable rate of 0.11.
since we cannot control commodity prices, controlling operating expenses and overhead costs, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. we continue to progress our multi-year business transformation initiative focused on identifying and implementing opportunities to improve our cost structure enterprise wide. we are executing on our initiatives to achieve a sustainable run-rate cost reduction of at least $800 million and a sustaining capital reduction of at least $200 million per year by the end of 2023.
we are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. optimizing utilization rates and product yield at our refineries through reliable and safe operations enables us to capture the value available in the market in terms of prices and margins. during 2022, our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90% and our worldwide refining clean product yield was 84%.
•growth. a disciplined capital allocation process ensures we invest in projects that are expected to generate competitive returns. our strategy primarily focuses on investing in high-return growth opportunities in the midstream and chemicals segments, as well as our investments in renewable fuels projects to advance a lower-carbon future. in 2023, we have budgeted $2 billion in capital expenditures and investments, which includes $1.1 billion of growth capital. approximately 50% of growth capital is expected to support lower-carbon opportunities. in midstream, we have budgeted $639 million for capital expenditures and investments, of which $310 million is for growth capital projects directed towards enhancing our integrated natural gas liquids (ngl) value chain from wellhead to market. in refining, we have budgeted $1.1 billion for capital expenditures and investments, of which $448 million is for the continued conversion of the san francisco refinery in rodeo, california into a renewable fuels facility.
in chemicals, our share of expected self-funded capital spending by chevron phillips chemical company llc (cpchem) is $925 million, of which $702 million is for growth capital projects. cpchem plans to use its growth capital to fund development of its petrochemical projects in the u.s. gulf coast and qatar, as well as expand its propylene splitting capacity and normal alpha olefins production.
as part of our strategy to grow our midstream ngl business, on january 5, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units of dcp lp, which will increase our economic interest in dcp lp from 43.3% to 86.8% at closing. this transaction will be accounted for as an equity transaction and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. we expect to fund this transaction with a combination of cash and debt.
•returns. we plan to enhance refining returns by focusing on low-capital, higher-return projects that increase asset reliability, improve market capture and reduce costs. our m&s segment will continue to develop and enhance our retail network, including energy transition opportunities.
•distributions. we believe shareholder value is enhanced through, among other things, a secure, competitive and growing dividend, complemented by share repurchases. in 2022, we paid $1.8 billion of dividends on our common stock. in the second quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5% to $0.97 per common share. in the first quarter of 2023, we increased our quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.05 per common share. regular dividends demonstrate the confidence our board of directors and management have in our capital structure and operations' capability to generate free cash flow throughout the business cycle. in the second quarter of 2022, we resumed repurchasing shares under our share repurchase program. in 2022, we repurchased $1.5 billion, or 16.6 million shares, of our common stock. on november 7, 2022, our board of directors approved a $5 billion increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount of share repurchases authorized by our board of directors since july 2012 to an aggregate of $20 billion.
at the discretion of our board of directors, we are targeting to return $10 billion to $12 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in the period from july 1, 2022 through december 31, 2024. the amount and timing of future dividend payments and the level and timing of future share repurchases will depend on various factors including our share price, results of operations, financial condition and cash required for future business plans.
•high-performing organization. we strive to attract, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values and culture. throughout the company, we focus on promoting an inclusive workplace that enables our diverse workforce to innovate, create value and deliver extraordinary performance. we also focus on getting results in the right way and embracing our values as a common bond, and we believe success is both what we do and how we do it. we encourage collaboration throughout our company, while valuing differences, respecting diversity, and creating a great place to work. we foster an environment of learning and development through structured programs focused on enhancing functional and technical skills where employees are engaged in our business and committed to their own, as well as the company's, success.
index to financial statements business environment the midstream segment includes our transportation and ngl businesses. our transportation business contains fee-based operations not directly exposed to commodity price risk. our ngl business, including dcp midstream class a segment, dcp sand hills and dcp southern hills from august 18, 2022, forward, contains both fee-based operations and operations directly impacted by ngl, natural gas and condensate prices. during 2022, ngl and natural gas prices increased, compared with 2021, supported by increasing liquified natural gas exports and higher crude oil prices.
the chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity investment in cpchem. the chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on supply and demand, as well as cost factors. compared with 2021, the benchmark high-density polyethylene chain margin decreased significantly in 2022, due to soft demand and increasing capacity, resulting in lower plant operating rates.
our refining segment results are driven by several factors, including market crack spreads, refinery throughput, feedstock costs, product yields, turnaround activity, and other operating costs. the price of u.s. benchmark crude oil, west texas intermediate (wti) at cushing, oklahoma, increased to an average of $94.44 per barrel during 2022, compared with an average of $67.96 per barrel in 2021. market crack spreads are used as indicators of refining margins and measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. worldwide market crack spreads increased to an average of $34.26 per barrel during 2022, compared with an average of $17.09 per barrel in 2021. the increases in crude oil prices and market crack spreads were primarily driven by improving demand for refined petroleum products, as economic activities gradually recovered as the impacts from the covid-19 pandemic moderated, as well as tightening supply due to the russia-ukraine war and refinery closures that occurred during the pandemic.
index to financial statements results of operations basis of presentation effective august 18, 2022, forward, in connection with the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings we began consolidating the results of dcp midstream class a segment, dcp sand hills and dcp southern hills. as a result of this transaction, we began presenting the results of dcp midstream class a segment within the results of our ngl and other business. prior periods also have been updated to reflect the results of our equity investment in dcp midstream prior to august 18, 2022, within the results of our ngl and other business. see note 3-dcp midstream, llc and gray oak holdings llc merger, note 4-business combination, and note 18-fair value measurements, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings.
effective october 1, 2022, we changed the organizational structure of the internal financial information reviewed by our president and chief executive officer, and determined this resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. as part of the realignment, we moved the results and net assets of our merey sweeny vacuum distillation and delayed coker units at our sweeny refinery and the isomerization unit at our lake charles refinery from our midstream segment to our refining segment. additionally, commissions charged to the refining segment by the m&s segment related to sales of specialty products were eliminated and the costs of the sales organization were reclassified from the m&s segment to the refining segment. further, we are no longer presenting disaggregated business line results for our chemicals and m&s segments to align with changes in our internal financial reporting.
effective january 1, 2022, we began reporting our investment in novonix limited (novonix) as a separate business line within our midstream segment. previously it was included in our ngl and other business line.
the segment realignment and business line reporting changes are presented for the year ended december 31, 2022, with the prior periods recast for comparability.
consolidated results a summary of income (loss) before income taxes by business segment with a reconciliation to net income (loss) attributable to phillips 66 follows:
income tax expense (benefit)                                          3,248                         146                     (1,250)
net income attributable to phillips 66 for the year ended december 31, 2022, was $11,024 million, compared with $1,317 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the improvement was primarily due to higher realized refining margins, an aggregate before-tax gain of $3,013 million recognized in our midstream segment in connection with the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings, lower impairments in the refining segment, and improved international marketing fuel margins. these improvements were partially offset by an increase in income tax expense, lower equity earnings from cpchem, and an unrealized decrease in the fair value of our investment in novonix.
net income attributable to phillips 66 for the year ended december 31, 2021, was $1,317 million, compared with net loss attributable to phillips 66 of $3,975 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the improvement was primarily due to lower impairments, improved realized refining margins and higher equity earnings from cpchem, partially offset by income tax impacts from improved results.
see note 4-business combination, and note 18-fair value measurements, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on the gain recognized in connection with the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings. see note 11-impairments, and note 18-fair value measurements, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for information on impairments recorded in 2021 and 2020. see note 23-income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on income taxes.
see the "segment results" section for additional information on our segment results.
other income increased $2,283 million in 2022, primarily due to an aggregate gain of $3,013 million recognized in our midstream segment in connection with the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings. the impact of this gain was partially offset by an unrealized investment loss on our investment in novonix, compared with an unrealized gain in 2021. see note 4-business combination, and note 18-fair value measurements, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on the aggregate gain. see note 8-investments, loans and long-term receivables, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding our investment in novonix.
operating expenses increased 19% in 2022, mainly attributable to higher utility costs driven by increased natural gas and power prices and higher turnaround and other maintenance expenses.
impairments decreased 96% in 2022 primarily due to a before-tax impairment of $1,298 million recorded in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our alliance refinery. see note 11-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
taxes other than income taxes increased 29% in 2022, primarily due to tax credits received from renewable diesel blending activity at our san francisco refinery in the third quarter of 2021, as well as higher property and other taxes.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 32% in 2022. the increase was primarily driven by the consolidation of dcp midstream class a segment, dcp sand hills and dcp southern hills, which resulted in us reflecting the additional noncontrolling interest owned by the public common and preferred unitholders of dcp lp, as well as enbridge's noncontrolling interest in dcp midstream class a segment, on our consolidated statement of operations. the increase was partially offset by a decrease due to the merger between us and phillips 66 partners that occurred in the first quarter of 2022 and resulted in phillips 66 partners becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of phillips 66. see note 3-dcp midstream, llc and gray oak holdings llc merger, and note 30-phillips 66 partners lp, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings and the phillips 66 partners merger, respectively.
equity in earnings of affiliates increased $1,713 million in 2021. the increase was primarily due to higher equity earnings from cpchem mainly driven by increased margins, wrb refining lp (wrb) resulting from improved realized refining margins and higher refinery production, and excel paralubes llc (excel paralubes) attributable to higher base oil margins. see chemicals segment analysis in the "segment results" section for additional information on cpchem.
net gain on dispositions decreased 83% in 2021, mainly reflecting a before-tax gain of $84 million recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with a co-venturer's acquisition of an ownership interest in the consolidated holding company that owned an interest in gray oak pipeline. see note 30-phillips 66 partners lp, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
other income increased $388 million in 2021, primarily driven by an unrealized gain of $365 million related to the change in fair value of our investment in novonix, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2021. see note 8-investments, loans and long-term receivables, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on our investment in novonix.
operating expenses increased 13% in 2021, mainly attributable to higher utility costs driven by increased commodity prices, higher employee-related expenses, and increased maintenance and repair costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13% in 2021, primarily driven by higher selling expenses due to rising refined petroleum product prices and demand, increased employee-related expenses, and a benefit received from a legal settlement in the first quarter of 2020.
depreciation and amortization increased 15% in 2021, mainly due to asset retirements related to the shutdown of our alliance refinery. see note 9-properties, plants and equipment, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding asset retirements related to the alliance refinery.
impairments decreased 65% in 2021. see note 11-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding impairments.
taxes other than income taxes decreased 12% in 2021, primarily driven by tax credits received from renewable diesel blending activity at our san francisco refinery in 2021, and lower property and franchise taxes.
interest and debt expense increased 16% in 2021, primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of capital projects and the placement of assets into service, as well as higher average debt principal balances resulting from new debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2020.
we had income tax expense of $146 million in 2021, compared with an income tax benefit of $1,250 million in 2020, primarily due to before-tax income in 2021 versus a before-tax loss in 2020. see note 23-income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for more information regarding our income taxes.
the midstream segment provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation, terminaling and processing services; ngl production, transportation, storage, fractionation, processing and marketing services; natural gas gathering, compressing, treating, processing, storage, transportation and marketing services; and condensate recovery. these activities are mainly in the united states. this segment also includes our investment in novonix.
in connection with the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings, the results of our transportation business reflect a decrease in our indirect economic interest in gray oak pipeline to 6.5% from august 18, 2022, forward. prior to august 18, 2022, the transportation results presented in the table above reflect gray oak holdings' 65% economic interest in gray oak pipeline. in addition, the results of our ngl and other business include the consolidated results of dcp midstream class a segment, dcp sand hills and dcp southern hills from august 18, 2022, forward. prior to august 18, 2022, our investments in dcp midstream, dcp sand hills and dcp southern hills were accounted for using the equity method. as a result of the merger and consolidation, equity earnings from our investment in dcp midstream prior to the merger have been included with the results of our ngl and other business.
results from our midstream segment increased $3,234 million in 2022, compared with 2021.
results from our transportation business increased $498 million in 2022, compared with 2021. the increase was primarily due to a before-tax impairment of $198 million recorded in the first quarter of 2021 related to phillips 66 partners' decision to exit the liberty pipeline project, a before-tax gain of $182 million from the transfer of a 35.75% indirect economic interest in gray oak pipeline to our co-venturer as part of the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings, and lower depreciation and amortization expense from logistic assets that were retired in the fourth quarter of 2021 as part of the planned conversion of the alliance refinery to a terminal.
results from our ngl and other business increased $3,548 million in 2022, compared with 2021. the increase was primarily due to before-tax gains totaling $2,831 million recognized from remeasuring our previously held equity investments in dcp midstream, dcp sand hills and dcp southern hills to their fair values in connection with the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings. additionally, the increased results reflect the consolidation of dcp midstream class a segment, dcp sand hills and dcp southern hills from august 18, 2022, forward, as well as improved sweeny hub results.
in 2022, the fair value of our investment in novonix decreased by $442 million compared with an increase of $370 million in 2021. we acquired this investment in september 2021.
see note 11-impairments, and note 8-investments, loans and long-term receivables, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on impairments and our investment in novonix, respectively. see note 4-business combination, and note 18-fair value measurements, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding the before-tax gains.
midstream's results increased $1,616 million in 2021, compared with 2020.
results from our transportation business increased $170 million in 2021, compared with 2020. the increase was primarily due to improved earnings from our equity affiliates, lower asset impairments, and increased pipeline volumes and tariffs. these increases were partially offset by a before-tax gain of $84 million recognized in the second quarter of 2020 associated with a co-venturer's acquisition of an ownership interest in the consolidated holding company that owned an interest in gray oak pipeline, and increased depreciation and amortization expense from logistic assets that were retired in the fourth quarter of 2021 as part of the planned conversion of the alliance refinery to a terminal.
results from our ngl and other business increased $1,076 million in 2021, compared with 2020. the increase in 2021 reflects a $1,161 million before-tax impairment of our investment in dcp midstream recorded in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by higher utility costs due to increased natural gas prices.
the fair value of our investment in novonix increased $370 million in 2021, compared with 2020. we acquired this investment in september 2021.

the chemicals segment consists of our 50% interest in cpchem, which we account for under the equity method. cpchem uses ngl and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. these products are then marketed and sold or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and other chemicals. cpchem produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products. ethylene produced is primarily consumed within cpchem for the production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins and polyethylene pipe. cpchem manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene, as well as manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products. unless otherwise noted, amounts referenced below reflect our net 50% interest in cpchem.
before-tax income from the chemicals segment decreased $988 million in 2022, compared with 2021. the decrease was primarily due to lower margins driven by decreased sale prices, higher feedstock and utility costs, as well as decreased results from cpchem's equity affiliates.
before-tax income from the chemicals segment increased $1,209 million in 2021, compared with 2020. the increase was primarily due to improved margins driven by increased sale prices reflecting strong demand and tight supply, partially offset by higher utility, turnaround, maintenance and repair costs.

the refining segment refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, as well as renewable fuels, at 12 refineries in the united states and europe.  in the fourth quarter of 2021, we shut down our alliance refinery.
results from the refining segment increased $10,169 million in 2022, compared with 2021. the improved results were primarily due to higher realized refining margins driven by improved market crack spreads, partially offset by higher operating costs. in addition, 2021 included a before-tax impairment of $1,288 million associated with our alliance refinery. see note 11-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding this impairment.
our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 90% and 84% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the increase in 2022 was primarily driven by improved demand for refined petroleum products due to supply constraints caused by the conflict between russia and ukraine and easing of restrictions from the covid-19 pandemic.
results from the refining segment increased $3,670 million in 2021, compared with 2020. the improved results in 2021 were primarily due to higher realized refining margins and lower asset impairments, partially offset by increased utility expenses and higher costs related to the shutdown of our alliance refinery. the improved realized refining margins in 2021 were mainly attributable to increased market crack spreads, partially offset by higher rin costs, lower clean product differentials and decreased secondary products margins. see note 11-impairments, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding impairments recorded in our refining segment during 2021 and 2020.
our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization rate was 84% and 76% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. the increase in 2021 was primarily driven by improved market demand for refined petroleum products following the administration of covid-19 vaccines and the easing of pandemic restrictions.
the m&s segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, as well as renewable fuels, mainly in the united states and europe. in addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of base oils and lubricants.
before-tax income from the m&s segment increased $679 million in 2022, compared with 2021. the increase in 2022 was primarily driven by improved realized international marketing fuel margins and higher results from our specialty lubricants and other businesses.
before-tax income from the m&s segment increased $302 million in 2021, compared with 2020. the increase in 2021 was primarily driven by higher realized u.s. marketing fuel margins and increased equity earnings from excel paralubes due to improved base oil margins, partially offset by lower realized international marketing fuel margins.
net interest expense consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. corporate overhead and other includes general and administrative expenses, technology costs, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, restructuring costs related to our business transformation, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment.
net interest expense decreased $46 million in 2022, compared with 2021, primarily driven by increased interest income, partially offset by increased interest expense as a result of consolidating dcp midstream class a segment from august 18, 2022, forward. see note 14-debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding debt.
corporate overhead and other increased $241 million in 2022, compared with 2021. the increase was primarily due to restructuring costs associated with our business transformation for consulting fees, severance and an impairment related to assets held for sale, as well as higher employee related expenses. see note 28-segment disclosures and related information, and note 31-restructuring, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding restructuring costs.
net interest expense increased $98 million in 2021, compared with 2020, primarily driven by lower capitalized interest due to the completion of capital projects and the placement of assets into service, and higher average debt principal balances reflecting debt issuances in the second and fourth quarters of 2020, as well as costs associated with early debt retirement in 2021. see note 14-debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on the debt repayment in 2021.

to meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we use a variety of funding sources but rely primarily on cash generated from operating activities and debt financing. during 2022, we generated $10.8 billion in cash from operations. we used available cash to pay down $2.4 billion in debt, fund capital expenditures and investments of $2.2 billion, pay dividends on our common stock of $1.8 billion and repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock. during 2022, cash and cash equivalents increased $3 billion to $6.1 billion.
significant sources of capital operating activities during 2022, cash generated by operating activities was $10.8 billion, a $4.8 billion increase compared with 2021. the increase was primarily due to higher earnings resulting from improved realized refining margins, partially offset by working capital impacts and lower distributions from equity affiliates.
during 2021, cash generated by operating activities was $6 billion, a $3.9 billion increase compared with 2020. the increase was primarily due to improved realized refining margins, a u.s. federal income tax refund of $1.1 billion received in the second quarter of 2021, and higher cash distributions from our equity affiliates, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
our short- and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon refining and marketing margins, ngl prices and chemicals margins. prices and margins in our industry are typically volatile, and are driven by market conditions over which we have little or no control. absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
the level and quality of output from our refineries also impact our cash flows. factors such as operating efficiency, maintenance turnarounds, market conditions, feedstock availability, and weather conditions can affect output. we actively manage the operations of our refineries, and any variability in their operations typically has not been as significant to cash flows as that caused by margins and prices. our worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization was 90%, 84% and 76% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. our worldwide refining clean product yield was 84%, 83% and 84% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
equity affiliate operating distributions our operating cash flows are also impacted by distribution decisions made by our equity affiliates, including cpchem. over the three years ended december 31, 2022, our operating cash flows included aggregate distributions from our equity affiliates of $6 billion, including $2.8 billion from cpchem. we cannot control the amount of future dividends from equity affiliates; therefore, future dividend payments by these equity affiliates are not assured.

in 2020, the trial court presiding over litigation brought by the standing rock sioux tribe (the tribe) ordered the u.s. army corps of engineers (usace) to prepare an environmental impact statement (eis) addressing an easement under lake oahe in north dakota. the court later vacated the easement. although the easement is vacated, the usace has no plans to stop pipeline operations while it proceeds with the eis, and the tribe's request for a shutdown was denied in may 2021. in june 2021, the trial court dismissed the litigation entirely. once the eis is completed, new litigation or challenges may be filed.
in february 2022, the u.s. supreme court (the court) denied dakota access' writ of certiorari requesting the court to review the lower court's decision to order the eis and vacate the easement. therefore, the requirement to prepare the eis stands. also in february 2022, the tribe withdrew as a cooperating agency, causing the usace to halt the eis process while the usace engaged with the tribe on their reasons for withdrawing. the draft eis process resumed in august 2022, and release is expected in spring 2023.

dcp lp cash distributions to unitholders dcp lp's partnership agreement requires that, within 45 days after the end of each quarter, dcp lp distributes all available cash. since the merger on august 18, 2022, dcp lp made cash distributions of $51 million to common unitholders other than phillips 66, $19 million to series a preferred unitholders, $6 million to series b preferred unitholders and $2 million to series c preferred unitholders. see note 29-dcp midstream class a segment, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, for additional information.
on january 24, 2023, the board of directors of dcp midstream gp, llc, declared a quarterly distribution on dcp lp's common units of $0.43 per common unit and a quarterly distribution on dcp lp's series b and series c preferred units of $0.4922 and $0.4969 per unit, respectively. the distribution on the common units was paid on february 14, 2023, to unitholders of record on february 3, 2023. the series b distribution will be paid on march 15, 2023, to unitholders of record on march 1, 2023. the series c distribution will be paid on april 17, 2023, to unitholders of record on april 3, 2023.
dcp lp preferred units dcp lp redeemed its series a preferred units with an aggregate liquidation preference of $500 million in december 2022. dcp lp funded this redemption from available cash and borrowings under its accounts receivable securitization facility.
merger with phillips 66 partners on march 9, 2022, we completed a merger between us and phillips 66 partners. the merger resulted in the acquisition of all limited partnership interests in phillips 66 partners not already owned by us in exchange for 41.8 million shares of phillips 66 common stock issued from treasury stock. phillips 66 partners common unitholders received 0.50 shares of phillips 66 common stock for each outstanding phillips 66 partners common unit. phillips 66 partners' perpetual convertible preferred units were converted into common units at a premium to the original issuance price prior to being exchanged for phillips 66 common stock. upon closing, phillips 66 partners became a wholly owned subsidiary of phillips 66 and its common units are no longer publicly traded. see note 30-phillips 66 partners lp, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on the merger transaction.
index to financial statements share repurchases in march 2020, we announced that we had temporarily suspended our share repurchases to preserve liquidity in response to the global economic disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic. we resumed purchasing shares under our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2022. on november 7, 2022, our board of directors approved a $5 billion increase to our share repurchase program. since july 2012, our board of directors has authorized an aggregate of $20 billion of repurchases of our outstanding common stock. the authorizations do not have expiration dates. future share repurchases are expected to be funded primarily through available cash. we are not obligated to repurchase any shares of common stock pursuant to these authorizations and may commence, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time. in 2022, we repurchased 16.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.5 billion. since the inception of our share repurchase program in 2012, we have repurchased 175.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $14 billion. shares of stock repurchased are held as treasury shares.
employee benefit plan contributions during the year ended december 31, 2022, we contributed $125 million to our u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans and $23 million to our international pension plans.
purchase obligations our purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms. we expect these purchase obligations will be fulfilled with operating cash flows in the period when due. as of december 31, 2022, our purchase obligations totaled $106.5 billion, with $44.4 billion due within one year.
the majority of our purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil and raw ngl. the products are used to supply our refineries and fractionators and optimize our supply chain. at december 31, 2022, product purchase commitments with third parties and related parties were $54.6 billion and $26.1 billion, respectively. the remaining purchase obligations mainly represent agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and product terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products, and our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned facilities where we are the operator.
debt principal and interest obligations as of december 31, 2022, our aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt was $17.2 billion, with $529 million due within one year. our obligations for interest on the debt totaled $10.2 billion, with $776 million due within one year. see note 14-debt, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information regarding our outstanding debt principal and interest obligations.

midstream capital spending in our midstream segment was $3.5 billion for the three-year period ended december 31, 2022, including:
•continued development and expansion of fractionation capacity at our sweeny hub. we completed two ngl fractionators (sweeny fracs 2 and 3) which commenced operations in 2020. we completed and started operations of sweeny frac 4 in the third quarter of 2022.
•completion of construction on our c2g pipeline, a new 16-inch ethane pipeline that connects our clemens caverns storage facility to petrochemical facilities in gregory, texas, near corpus christi.
•net cash payment in connection with the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings.
•contributions to fund the gray oak pipeline project and south texas gateway terminal development activities.
•spending associated with other return, reliability, and maintenance projects in our transportation and ngl businesses.
chemicals during the three-year period ended december 31, 2022, cpchem had a self-funded capital program that totaled $2.7 billion on a 100% basis. capital spending was primarily for the development of petrochemical projects on the u.s. gulf coast and in the middle east, as well as sustaining, debottlenecking and optimization projects on existing assets.
index to financial statements refining capital spending for the refining segment during the three-year period ended december 31, 2022, was $2.5 billion, primarily for refinery upgrade projects to enhance the yield of high-value products, renewable fuels projects, improvements to the operating integrity of key processing units, and safety-related projects.
•installation of facilities to improve clean product yield at the ponca city and sweeny refineries, as well as the jointly owned wood river refinery.
•installation of facilities to improve product value at the lake charles refinery.
•installation of facilities to produce renewable fuels at our san francisco and humber refineries.
marketing and specialties capital spending for the m&s segment during the three-year period ended december 31, 2022, was primarily for investment in retail marketing joint ventures in the u.s. west coast and central regions; the continued acquisition, development and enhancement of retail sites in europe; and acquisition of a commercial fleet fueling business in california, which will provide further placement opportunities for renewable diesel production to end-use customers.
corporate and other capital spending for corporate and other during the three-year period ended december 31, 2022, was primarily for information technology and facilities.
2023 budget our 2023 capital budget is $2 billion, including $865 million for sustaining capital and $1.1 billion for growth capital. approximately 50% of growth capital is expected to support lower-carbon opportunities. our projected $2 billion capital budget excludes our portion of planned capital spending by our major joint ventures cpchem and wrb totaling $1.1 billion.
the midstream capital budget of $639 million includes a growth capital budget of $310 million which will be directed toward enhancing our integrated ngl value chain from wellhead to market. the midstream capital budget also includes $329 million for sustaining projects. the midstream expected spend includes 100% of dcp lp's sustaining capital of $150 million and $125 million of growth capital. in refining, the total capital budget of $1.1 billion consists of $389 million for reliability, safety and environmental projects and $729 million for growth capital. refining's growth capital includes the continued conversion of the san francisco refinery into a renewable fuels facility. the m&s capital budget of $134 million reflects the continued development and enhancement of our retail network, including energy transition opportunities. the corporate and other capital budget is $108 million primarily for digital transformation and information technology projects.
index to financial statements contingencies a number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims that arose in the ordinary course of business have been filed against us or are subject to indemnifications provided by us. we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. we regularly assess the need for financial recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. in the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. if a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. we do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. in the case of income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is uncertain.
based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. as we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other potentially responsible parties. estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
legal and tax matters our legal and tax matters are handled by our legal and tax organizations. these organizations apply their knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases and uncertain tax positions. we employ a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings. our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases and enables the tracking of those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required. in the case of income tax-related contingencies, we monitor tax legislation and court decisions, the status of tax audits and the statute of limitations within which a taxing authority can assert a liability. see note 23-income taxes, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information about income tax-related contingencies.
•european union regulation for registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (eu reach), which governs production, marketing and use of chemicals and the united kingdom's legislation for the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals (uk reach), which replaced eu reach in the united kingdom in 2021 following the united kingdom's exit from the european union (brexit).
•u.s. federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.
•u.s. federal emergency planning and community right-to-know act (epcra), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical inventories to local emergency planning committees and response departments.
•u.s. federal oil pollution act of 1990 (opa90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines as well as owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of crude oil into navigable waters of the united states.
•european union trading directive resulting in the european union emissions trading scheme (eu ets), which uses a market-based mechanism to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, as well as the united kingdom emissions trading scheme (uk ets), which replaced the eu ets in the united kingdom in 2021, following brexit.
these laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. they also, in most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations. these permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time consuming. in addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency's processing of the application. many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
other foreign countries and many states where we operate also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. while similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of developing infrastructure and marketing and transporting products across state and international borders. for example, in california the south coast air quality management district (scaqmd) approved amendments to the regional clean air incentives market (reclaim) that became effective in 2016, which require a phased reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions through 2022, affecting refineries in the los angeles metropolitan area. in 2017, scaqmd required additional nitrogen oxide emissions reductions through 2025 and, on november 5, 2021, promulgated new regulations to replace the reclaim program with a traditional command and control regulatory regime.
the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. however, environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate. notable areas of potential impacts include air emissions compliance and remediation obligations in the united states.
index to financial statements an example of this in the fuels area is the energy independence and security act of 2007 (eisa). it requires fuel producers and importers to provide additional renewable fuels for transportation motor fuels and stipulates a mix of various types. rins form the mechanism used by the epa to record compliance with the renewable fuel standard (rfs). if an obligated party has more rins than it needs to meet its obligation, it may sell or trade the extra rins, or instead choose to "bank" them for use the following year. we have met the requirements to date while establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology development, to address projected future renewable volume obligation (rvo) requirements. on december 1, 2022, the epa proposed rvo for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 compliance years, as well as rin generation from renewable electricity utilized as a transportation fuel (erins). these standards increase cellulosic volumes, which reflect the epa's forecast for increasing erin volumes beginning in 2024. they also increase total advanced biofuel volumes, which reflect the epa's forecast for increasing erin volumes beginning in 2024. in addition, they increase total advanced biofuel volumes from the 5.63 billion gallons established for the 2022 compliance year to 7.43 billion gallons in 2025. if adopted, we may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products and increased program costs if not fully recovered in the market. this program continues to be the subject of possible congressional review and re-promulgation in revised form, and the epa's final regulations establishing rvo requirements have been and continue to be subject to legal challenge, further creating uncertainty regarding rvo requirements.
we are required to purchase rins in the open market to satisfy the portion of our obligation under the rfs that is not fulfilled by blending renewable fuels into the motor fuels we produce. for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred expenses of $478 million, $441 million and $342 million, respectively, associated with our obligation to purchase rins in the open market to comply with the rfs for our wholly owned refineries. these expenses are included in the "purchased crude oil and products" line item on our consolidated statement of operations. our jointly owned refineries also incurred expenses associated with the purchase of rins in the open market, of which our share was $437 million, $351 million and $133 million for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. these expenses are included in the "equity in earnings of affiliates" line item on our consolidated statement of operations. the amount of these expenses and fluctuations between periods is primarily driven by the market price of rins, refinery production, blending activities, and rvo requirements.
we also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. such laws and regulations include cercla and rcra and their state equivalents. remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous previously and currently owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the united states. federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. in addition to other cleanup standards, many states have adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (mtbe) for both soil and groundwater and both the epa and many states may adopt cleanup standards for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas), which may have been a constituent in certain firefighting foams used or stored at or near some of our facilities.
at rcra-permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. if conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. in contrast to cercla, which is often referred to as "superfund," the cost of corrective action activities under rcra corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. we anticipate increased expenditures for rcra remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.
we occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute. on occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. these requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. as of december 31, 2021, we reported that we had been notified of potential liability under cercla and comparable state laws at 25 sites within the united states. in 2022, we were notified of one potentially new site through a cercla section 104(e) information request issued by the epa, and four sites that were deemed resolved and closed, accordingly, leaving 22 unresolved sites with potential liability at december 31, 2022.
index to financial statements for the majority of superfund sites, our potential liability will be less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. many of the sites for which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agencies concerned. prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. in some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain the epa or equivalent state agency approval of a remediation plan. there are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all cercla sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.
we incur costs related to the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of environmental pollution. expensed environmental costs were $728 million in 2022 and are expected to be approximately $800 million in 2023 and 2024. capitalized environmental costs were $88 million in 2022 and are expected to be approximately $140 million and $250 million, in 2023 and 2024, respectively. these amounts do not include capital expenditures made for other purposes that have an indirect benefit on environmental compliance.
accrued liabilities for remediation activities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a business combination, which we record on a discounted basis).
many of these liabilities result from cercla, rcra and similar state laws that require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where our generated waste was disposed. we also have accrued for a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of cercla, rcra or state enforcement activities. if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. in the future, we may incur significant costs under both cercla and rcra. remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.
notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in certain of our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that those costs and liabilities will not be material. however, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
climate change there has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on ghg emissions reduction, including various regulations proposed or issued by the epa. these proposed or promulgated laws apply or could apply in states and/or countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. laws regulating ghg emissions continue to evolve, and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws potentially could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition as a result of increasing costs of compliance, lengthening project implementation and agency reviews, or reducing demand for certain hydrocarbon products. examples of legislation or precursors for possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:
•eu ets, which is part of the european union's policy to combat climate change and is a key tool for reducing industrial ghg emissions. eu ets impacts factories, power stations and other installations across all eu member states. as a result of the united kingdom's exit from the eu (brexit), those types of entities in the united kingdom are now subject to the uk ets, rather than the eu ets.
•eu renewable energy directive ii, which increases the eu's energy consumption from renewable sources in the electricity, heat, and transportation sectors to 32% by 2030.
•united kingdom's renewable fuel obligation, which is intended to reduce the ghg emissions from fuel used in the united kingdom transportation sector by encouraging the supply of renewable fuels.
•california's senate bill no. 32, which requires reduction of california's ghg emissions to 40% below the 1990 emission level by 2030, and assembly bill 398, which extends the california ghg emission cap and trade program through 2030. other ghg emissions programs in the western u.s. states have been enacted or are under consideration or development, including amendments to california's low carbon fuel standard, california's advanced clean cars and trucks programs, california's carbon neutrality by 2045 scoping plan, oregon's low carbon fuel standard and climate protection plan, and washington's carbon reduction programs.
•united states' inflation reduction act, which contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies, which is intended to accelerate the energy transition.
•the u.s. supreme court decision in massachusetts v. epa, 549 u.s. 497, 127 s. ct. 1438 (2007), confirming that the epa has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an "air pollutant" under the federal clean air act.
•the epa's announcement on march 29, 2010 (published as "interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs," 75 fed. reg. 17004 (april 2, 2010)), and the epa's and u.s. department of transportation's joint promulgation of a final rule on april 1, 2010, that triggers regulation of ghgs under the clean air act. these collectively may lead to more climate-based claims for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects to determine the extent of potential climate change.
•the epa's 2015 final rule regulating ghg emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electrical generating units under the federal clean air act, commonly referred to as the clean power plan. the epa commenced rulemaking in 2017 to rescind the clean power plan and, in august 2018, the epa proposed the affordable clean energy (ace) rule as its replacement. on january 19, 2021, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia invalidated the ace rule and remanded the matter to the epa, essentially restarting this rulemaking process.
in the eu, the first phase of the eu ets completed at the end of 2007. phase ii was undertaken from 2008 through 2012, and phase iii ran from 2013 through to 2020. phase iv runs from january 1, 2021 through 2030 and sectors covered under the ets must reduce their ghg emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels and there is agreement between the eu member states, the european parliament, and the eu commission (which is pending ratification by the eu council and european parliament) to increase the phase iv ghg emissions reduction to 63% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. the united kingdom is no longer part of the eu ets and, instead, has been under the uk ets since 2021. phillips 66 has assets that are subject to the eu ets and assets that are subject to the uk ets.
from november 30 to december 12, 2015, more than 190 countries, including the united states, participated in the united nations climate change conference in paris, france. the conference culminated in what is known as the "paris agreement," which, upon certain conditions being met, entered into force on november 4, 2016. the paris agreement establishes a commitment by signatory parties to pursue domestic ghg emission reductions. in 2017, president trump announced his intention to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement and that withdrawal became effective on november 4, 2020. on january 20, 2021, president biden signed the "acceptance on behalf of the united states of america," which allows the united states to rejoin the paris agreement. the united states officially rejoined the paris agreement in february 2021, which could lead to additional ghg emission reduction requirements for sources in the united states.
in the united states, some additional form of regulation is likely to be forthcoming at the state or federal levels with respect to ghg emissions. such regulation could take any of several forms that may result in additional financial burden in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.
index to financial statements compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a ghg emission trading program, ghg reduction requirements or carbon taxes could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources.
an example of one such program is california's cap and trade program, which was promulgated pursuant to the state's global warming solutions act. the program had been limited to certain stationary sources, which include our refineries in california, but beginning in january 2015 was expanded to include emissions from transportation fuels distributed in california. inclusion of transportation fuels in california's cap and trade program as currently promulgated has increased our cap and trade program compliance costs. the ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, from this and similar programs, will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:
•the price and availability of offsets.
we consider and take into account anticipated future ghg emissions in designing and developing major facilities and projects, and implement energy efficiency initiatives to reduce ghg emissions. data on our ghg emissions, legal requirements regulating such emissions, and the possible physical effects of climate change on our coastal assets are incorporated into our planning, investment, and risk management decision-making. we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operations.
in february 2022, we announced our intention to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions intensity related to our operations by 50% of 2019 levels by the year 2050. this new target builds upon our previously announced 2030 ghg emissions intensity targets to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from our operations by 30% and scope 3 emissions from our energy products by 15% compared to 2019 levels.
in addition to the disclosures above, we have issued our 2022 sustainability report that is accessible on our website and provides more detailed information on our environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives, including detailed information on environmental metrics.
index to financial statements critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. see note 1-summary of significant accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for descriptions of our major accounting policies. some of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. the following discussion of critical accounting estimates addresses accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions could be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.
business combination in accounting for a business combination, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. the excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. a significant amount of judgment is made in estimating the individual fair value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, noncontrolling interests and other assets and liabilities. we use available information to make these fair value determinations and engage third-party specialists in the valuation process as necessary.
the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity specific differences. the estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the estimated results used to determine fair value.
see note 4-business combination, and note 18-fair value measurements, in the notes to consolidated financial statements, for additional information on the merger of dcp midstream and gray oak holdings and fair value measurements.
impairment of long-lived assets and equity method investments long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future expected cash flows. if the sum of the undiscounted expected future before-tax cash flows of an asset group is less than the carrying value, including applicable liabilities, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined using one or more of the following methods: the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants; a market multiple for similar assets; historical market transactions including similar assets, adjusted using principal market participant assumptions when necessary; or replacement cost adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments, including future volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, margins, discount rates and capital project decisions, considering all available information at the date of review.
index to financial statements investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment when there are indicators of a loss in value, such as a lack of sustained earnings capacity or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount. when it is determined that an indicated impairment is other than temporary, a charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value. when determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee's financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that allows for recovery. when quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants and observed market earnings multiples of comparable companies, if appropriate. different assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.

index to financial statements non-gaap reconciliations refining our realized refining margins measure the difference between (a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of petroleum products manufactured at our refineries and (b) costs of feedstocks, primarily crude oil, used to produce the petroleum products. the realized refining margins are adjusted to include our proportional share of our joint venture refineries' realized margins, as well as to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call "special items." the realized refining margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by total refinery processed inputs (primarily crude oil) measured on a barrel basis, including our share of inputs processed by our joint venture refineries. our realized refining margin per barrel is intended to be comparable with industry refining margins, which are known as "crack spreads." as discussed in "executive overview and business environment-business environment," industry crack spreads measure the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil. we believe realized refining margin per barrel calculated on a similar basis as industry crack spreads provides a useful measure of how well we performed relative to benchmark industry refining margins.
the gaap performance measure most directly comparable to realized refining margin per barrel is the refining segment's "income (loss) before income taxes per barrel." realized refining margin per barrel excludes items that are typically included in a manufacturer's gross margin, such as depreciation and operating expenses, and other items used to determine income (loss) before income taxes, such as general and administrative expenses. it also includes our proportional share of joint venture refineries' realized refining margins and excludes special items. because realized refining margin per barrel is calculated in this manner, and because realized refining margin per barrel may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, it has limitations as an analytical tool. following are reconciliations of income (loss) before income taxes to realized refining margins:

index to financial statements marketing our realized marketing fuel margins measure the difference between (a) sales and other operating revenues derived from the sale of fuels in our m&s segment and (b) costs of those fuels. the realized marketing fuel margins are adjusted to exclude those items that are not representative of the underlying operating performance of a period, which we call "special items." the realized marketing fuel margins are converted to a per-barrel basis by dividing them by sales volumes measured on a barrel basis. we believe realized marketing fuel margin per barrel demonstrates the value uplift our marketing operations provide by optimizing the placement and ultimate sale of our refineries' fuel production.

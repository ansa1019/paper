item 1a.       risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks. additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under "forward-looking statements" above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
table of contents overview the company's risk management framework documents the definition, potential manifestation, and management of its risks. the company's risks include investment, insurance, market, liquidity, and operational risk, as well as strategic risks that may cause the company's core business model to change, either through a shift in the businesses in which it is engaged or a change in execution. the company's strategic risks include regulatory and technological changes and other external factors. the company's risks are further discussed below. our risk management framework is described under "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-risk management."
investment risk our investment portfolios are subject to the risk of loss due to default or deterioration in credit quality or value.
we are exposed to investment risk through our investments, which primarily consist of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities and alternative assets including private equity, hedge funds and real estate. for a discussion of our general account investments, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-general account investments." we are also exposed to investment risk through a potential counterparty default.
investment risk may result from (1) economic conditions, (2) adverse capital market conditions, including disruptions in individual market sectors or a lack of buyers in the marketplace, (3) volatility, (4) credit spread changes, (5) benchmark interest rate changes, (6) changes in foreign currency exchange rates and (7) declines in value of underlying collateral. these factors may impact the credit quality, liquidity and value of our investments and derivatives, potentially resulting in higher capital charges and unrealized or realized losses. also, certain investments we hold, regardless of market conditions, are relatively illiquid and our ability to promptly sell these assets for their full value may be limited. additionally, our valuation of investments may include methodologies, inputs and assumptions which are subject to change and different interpretation and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially impact our results of operations or financial condition. for information about the valuation of our investments, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk, which is the risk that an obligor (or guarantor) is unable or unwilling to meet its contractual payment obligations on its fixed maturity security, loan or other obligations. credit risk may manifest in an idiosyncratic manner (i.e., specific to an individual borrower or industry) or through market-wide credit cycles. financial deterioration of the obligor increases the risk of default and may increase the capital charges required under such regimes as the naic rbc, the fsa smr or other constructs to hold the investment and in turn, potentially limit our overall capital flexibility. credit defaults (as well as credit impairments, realized losses on credit-related sales, and increases in credit related reserves) may result in losses which adversely impact earnings, capital and our ability to appropriately match our liabilities and meet future obligations.
some of our insurance operations are in emerging markets where we may be required to hold capital in local sovereign obligations. investment risk is heightened in these markets, in particular for obligations that are not denominated in the local currency.
our company is subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default or deteriorate in creditworthiness before or at the final settlement of a transaction. in the normal course of business, we enter into financial contracts to manage risks (such as derivatives to manage market risk and reinsurance treaties to manage insurance risk), improve the return on investments (such as securities lending and repurchase transactions) and provide sources of liquidity or financing (such as credit agreements, securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements). these transactions expose the company to counterparty risk. counterparties include commercial banks, investment banks, broker-dealers and insurance and reinsurance companies. in the event of a counterparty deterioration or default, the magnitude of the losses will depend on then current market conditions and the length of time required to enter into a replacement transaction with a new counterparty. losses are likely to be higher under stressed conditions.
our investment portfolio is subject to equity risk, which is the risk of loss due to deterioration in market value of public equity or alternative assets. we include public equity and alternative assets (including private equity, hedge funds and real estate) in our portfolio constructions, as these asset classes can provide returns over longer periods of time, aligning with the long-term nature of certain of our liabilities. public equity and alternative assets have varying degrees of price transparency. equities traded on stock exchanges (public equities) have significant price transparency, as transactions are often required to be disclosed publicly. assets with less price transparency include private equity (joint ventures/limited partnerships) and direct real estate. as these investments typically do not trade on public markets and indications of realizable market value may not be table of contents readily available, valuations can be infrequent and/or more volatile. a sustained decline in public equity and alternative markets may reduce the returns earned by our investment portfolio through lower-than-expected dividend income, property operating income, and capital gains, thereby adversely impacting earnings, capital, and product pricing assumptions. these assets may also produce volatility in earnings as a result of uneven distributions on the underlying investments.
insurance risk we have significant liabilities for policyholders' benefits which are subject to insurance risk. insurance risk is the risk that actual experience deviates adversely from our insurance assumptions, including mortality, morbidity, and policyholder behavior assumptions.
we provide a variety of insurance products, on both an individual and group basis, that are designed to help customers protect against a variety of financial uncertainties. our insurance products protect customers against their potential risk of loss by transferring those risks to the company, where those risks can be managed more efficiently through pooling and diversification over a larger number of independent exposures. during this transfer process, we assume the risk that actual losses experienced in our insurance products deviates significantly from what we expect. more specifically, insurance risk is concerned with the deviations that impact our future liabilities. our profitability may decline if mortality experience, morbidity experience or policyholder behavior experience differ significantly from our expectations when we price our products. in addition, if we experience higher than expected claims our liquidity position may be adversely impacted, and we may incur losses on investments if we are required to sell assets in order to pay claims. if it is necessary to sell assets at a loss, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. for a discussion of the impact of changes in insurance assumptions on our financial condition, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-accounting policies and pronouncements-application of critical accounting estimates-insurance liabilities."
certain of our insurance products are subject to mortality risk, which is the risk that actual deaths experienced deviate adversely from our expectations. mortality risk is a biometric risk that can manifest in the following ways:
•mortality calamity is the risk that mortality rates in a single year deviate adversely from what is expected as the result of pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, military actions or terrorism. a mortality calamity event will reduce our earnings and capital and we may be forced to liquidate assets before maturity in order to pay the excess claims. mortality calamity risk is more pronounced in respect of specific geographic areas (including major metropolitan centers, where we have concentrations of customers, including under group and individual life insurance, concentrations of employees or significant operations) and in respect of countries and regions in which we operate that are subject to a greater potential threat of military action or conflict. ultimate losses would depend on several factors, including the rates of mortality and morbidity among various segments of the insured population, the collectability of reinsurance, the possible macroeconomic effects on our investment portfolio, the effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies and other variables.
•mortality trend is the risk that mortality improvements in the future deviate adversely from what is expected. mortality trend is a long-term risk that could emerge gradually over time. longevity products, such as annuities, pension risk transfer and long-term care, may experience adverse impacts due to higher-than-expected mortality improvement. mortality products, such as life insurance, experience adverse impacts due to lower-than-expected mortality improvement. if this risk were to emerge, the company would update assumptions used to calculate reserves for in-force business, which may result in additional assets needed to meet the higher expected annuity claims or earlier expected life claims. an increase in reserves due to revised assumptions has an immediate impact on our results of operations and financial condition; however, economically the impact is generally long term as the excess outflow is paid over time.
•mortality base is the risk that actual base mortality deviates adversely from what is expected in pricing and valuing our products. base mortality risk can arise from a lack of credible data on which to base the assumptions.
we use a variety of strategies to manage our mortality risks, including the use of reinsurance and derivative instruments. these strategies, however, may not be fully effective and may lead to payments to counterparties in excess of recoveries depending on how actual mortality experience emerges and on future changes in the level of premiums we pay to reinsurers. we may also benefit from offsetting impacts between our mortality and longevity products in adverse mortality or longevity scenarios; however, the extent of this offset may vary.
certain of our insurance products are subject to morbidity risk, which is the risk that either incidence or continuation experience deviates adversely from what is expected. morbidity risk is a biometric risk that can manifest in the following ways:
•morbidity incidence is the risk that the rate at which policyholders become unhealthy (and qualify for benefits under insurance policies) deviates adversely from what is expected. we are exposed to morbidity incidence risk primarily through the short-term disability, long-term disability and long-term care products in the u.s., and through the accident and health products in japan.
•morbidity continuation is the risk that the length of time for which policyholders remain unhealthy deviates adversely from what is expected. this risk is primarily in our disability and long-term care products.
in each case, an increase in claims, or an increase in reserves due to revised morbidity assumptions can have an immediate impact on our results of operations and financial condition; however, economically the impact of morbidity risk for products that pay out for ongoing illness or disability generally emerges over the longer term as the morbidity claims are paid.
•lapse calamity is the risk that lapse rates over the short-term deviate adversely from what is expected, for example, surrenders of certain insurance products may increase following a downgrade of our financial strength ratings or adverse publicity. only certain products are exposed to this risk. products that offer a cash surrender value that resides in the general account, such as non-participating whole life products, could pose a potential short-term lapse calamity risk. surrender of these products can impact liquidity, and it may be necessary in certain market conditions to sell assets to meet surrender demands. lapse calamity can also impact our earnings through its impact on estimated future profits.
•policyholder behavior risk is the risk that the behavior of our customers or policyholders deviates adversely from what is expected. policyholder behavior risk arises through product features which provide some degree of choice or flexibility for the policyholder, which can impact the amount and/or timing of claims. such choices include surrender, lapse, partial withdrawal, policy loan utilization, and premium payment rates for contracts with flexible premiums. while some behavior is driven by macro factors such as market movements, policyholder behavior at a fundamental level is driven primarily by policyholders' individual needs, which may differ significantly from product to product depending on many factors including the features offered, the approach taken to market each product, and competitor pricing. for example, persistency (the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force) within our annuities business may be significantly impacted by the value of guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current account values in light of poor market performance as well as other factors. many of our products also provide our customers with wide flexibility with respect to the amount and timing of premium deposits and the amount and timing of withdrawals from the policy's value. results may vary based on differences between actual and expected premium deposits and withdrawals for these products, especially if these product features are relatively new to the marketplace. the pricing of certain of our variable annuity products that contain certain living benefit guarantees is also based on assumptions about utilization rates, or the percentage of contracts that will utilize the benefit during the contract duration, including the timing of the first withdrawal. results may vary based on differences between actual and expected benefit utilization. we may also be impacted by customers seeking to sell their benefits. in particular, the development of a secondary market for life insurance, including life settlements or "viaticals" and investor-owned life insurance, and third-party investor strategies in the annuities business, could adversely affect the profitability of existing business and our pricing assumptions for new business. policyholder behavior risk is generally a long-term risk that emerges over time. an increase in reserves due to revised assumptions has an immediate impact on our results of operations and financial condition; however, from an economic or cash flow perspective, the impact is generally long term as the excess outflow is paid over time.
our ability to reprice products is limited and may not compensate for deviations from our expected insurance assumptions. although some of our products permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits during the life of the policy or contract, the adjustments permitted under the terms of the policies or contracts may not be sufficient to maintain profitability or may cause the policies or contracts to lapse. for example, for our long-term care insurance products, our assumptions for reserves for future policy benefits have factored in an estimate of the timing and amount of anticipated and yet-to-be-filed premium rate increases, including those which may require state approval. our actual experience obtaining pricing increases could be materially different than what we have assumed, resulting in further policy liability increases which could be material. many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits or limit those adjustments during the life of the policy or contract. even if permitted under the policy or contract, other factors may impact our decision whether to raise premiums or adjust other charges sufficiently, or at all. accordingly, significant deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products.
table of contents market risk the profitability of many of our insurance and annuity products, as well as the fees we earn in our investment management business, are subject to market risk. market risk is the risk of loss from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates.
the profitability of many of our insurance and annuity products depends in part on the value of the separate accounts supporting these products, which can fluctuate substantially depending on market conditions. market conditions resulting in reductions in the value of assets we manage has an adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of our investment management business, which depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, and could decrease the value of our strategic investments.
derivative instruments that we use to hedge and manage foreign exchange, interest rate and equity market risks associated with our products and businesses, and other risks might not perform as intended or expected, resulting in higher-than-expected realized losses and stresses on liquidity and/or regulatory capital. market conditions can limit availability of hedging instruments, require us to post additional collateral, and further increase the cost of executing product related hedges and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged.
market risk may limit opportunities for investment of available funds at desired returns, including due to the prevailing interest rate environment, or other factors, with possible negative impacts on our overall results. limited opportunities for attractive investments may lead to holding cash for long periods of time and an increased use of derivatives for duration management and other portfolio management purposes. the increased use of derivatives or portfolio rebalancing may increase the volatility of our u.s. gaap results and our statutory capital.
our investments, results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected by developments in the global economy, in the u.s. economy (including as a result of actions by the federal reserve with respect to interest rate and monetary policy, and adverse political developments), and in the japanese economy (including due to the effects of inflation or deflation, interest rate volatility, changes in the japan sovereign credit rating, and material changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the u.s. dollar). global, u.s. or japanese economic activity and financial markets may in turn be negatively affected by adverse developments or conditions in specific geographical regions.
for a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on our liquidity and capital resources outlook, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-overview-current market conditions."
for a discussion of the impact of changes in market conditions on our financial condition see item 7a "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
our insurance and annuity products and certain of our investment products, and our investment returns, are subject to interest rate risk, which is the risk of loss arising from asset/liability duration mismatches within our general account investments as well as invested assets of other entities and operations. the risk of mismatch in asset/liability duration is mainly driven by the specific dynamics of product liabilities. some product liabilities are expected to have only modest risk related to interest rates because cash flows can be matched by available assets; however, other product liabilities generate long-term cash flows (i.e., 30 years or more), resulting in significant interest rate risk, since these cash flows cannot be matched by assets for sale in the marketplace, exposing the company to future reinvestment risk. in addition, certain of our products provide for recurring premiums which may be invested at interest rates lower than the rates included in our pricing assumptions. market-sensitive cash flows exist with other product liabilities including products whose cash flows can be linked to market performance through secondary guarantees, minimum crediting rates, and/or changes in insurance assumptions.
our exposure to interest rates can manifest over years as in the case of earnings compression or in the short term by creating volatility in both earnings and capital. for example, some of our products expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting these contracts. when interest rates decline or remain low, we must invest in lower-yielding instruments, potentially reducing net investment income and constraining our ability to offer certain products. this risk is increased as more policyholders may retain their policies in a low rate environment. since many of our policies and contracts have guaranteed minimum crediting rates or limit the resetting of crediting rates, the spreads could decrease or go negative.
table of contents alternatively, when interest rates rise, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account with the higher-yielding assets as quickly as needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep these products and contracts competitive. it is possible that fewer policyholders may retain their policies and annuity contracts as they pursue higher crediting rates, which could expose the company to losses and liquidity stress. in addition, rising interest rates could cause a decline in the market value of fixed income assets the company manages which in turn could result in lower asset management fees earned.
our mitigation efforts with respect to interest rate risk are primarily focused on maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a key rate duration profile that is approximately equal to the key rate duration profile of our liability and surplus benchmarks; however, these benchmarks are based on estimates of the liability cash flow profiles which are complex and could turn out to be inaccurate, especially when markets are volatile. in addition, there are practical and capital market limitations on our ability to accomplish this matching. due to these and other factors we may need to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to satisfy liabilities or be forced to reinvest funds in a lower rate environment.
our significant business operations outside the u.s. subject us to foreign exchange risk, which is the risk of loss arising from assets that are invested in a different currency than the related liability, as well as the unhedged portion of the company's earnings from, and capital supporting, operations in a foreign currency. as a u.s.-based company with significant business operations outside of the u.s., particularly in japan, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to these operations, as well as in our investment portfolio. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and cash flows, as well as increase the volatility of our results of operations under u.s. gaap. in the short-term, solvency margins in our japan businesses can also be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates.
for our international businesses' operations, our retirement strategies segment's earnings on non-u.s. dollar-denominated reinsurance contracts and pgim's investment activities based in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, changes in foreign currency exchange rates create risk that we may experience volatility in the u.s. dollar-equivalent earnings and equity of these operations. we seek to manage this risk through various hedging strategies, including the use of foreign currency hedges and through holding u.s. dollar-denominated securities in the investment portfolios of certain of these operations. additionally, our japanese insurance operations offer a variety of non-japanese yen denominated products. we seek to mitigate this risk by holding investments in corresponding currencies. for certain of our international insurance operations outside of japan, we elect to not hedge the risk of changes in our subsidiary equity investments due to foreign exchange rate movements.
for our domestic investment portfolios supporting our u.s. insurance operations and other proprietary investment portfolios, our foreign currency exchange rate risk arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies. we manage this risk by hedging substantially all domestic foreign currency-denominated fixed-income investments into u.s. dollars. we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities. the value and liquidity of our foreign currency investments could be adversely affected by local market, economic and financial conditions.
there can be no assurance that our hedging and other strategies will effectively mitigate foreign exchange risk. for a discussion of our hedging program and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our business, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-impact of foreign currency exchange rates."
guarantees within certain of our products, in particular our variable annuities and to a lesser extent certain individual life and international insurance products, are market sensitive and may decrease our earnings or increase the volatility of our results of operations or financial position under u.s. gaap. certain of our products, particularly our variable annuity products and to a lesser extent certain international insurance products, include guarantees of minimum surrender values or income streams for stated periods or for life, which may be in excess of account values. certain of our products, particularly certain index-linked annuity and individual life products, include interest crediting guarantees based on the performance of an index. downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility, increased credit spreads, or (as discussed above) reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of liabilities associated with such guarantees, resulting in increases in reserves and reductions in net income. we use a variety of hedging and risk management strategies, including product features, to mitigate these risks in part and we may periodically change our strategies over time. these strategies may, however, not be fully effective. in addition, we may be unable or may choose not to fully hedge these risks. hedging instruments may not effectively offset the costs of guarantees or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. hedging instruments also may not change in value correspondingly with associated liabilities due to equity market or interest rate conditions, non-performance risk or other reasons. we may choose to hedge these risks on a basis that does not correspond to their anticipated or actual impact upon our results of operations or financial position under u.s. gaap. changes from period to period in the valuation of these policy benefits, and in the amount of our obligations effectively hedged, will result in volatility in our results table of contents of operations and financial position under u.s. gaap and the statutory capital levels of our insurance subsidiaries. estimates and assumptions we make in connection with hedging activities may fail to reflect or correspond to our actual long-term exposure from our guarantees. further, the risk of increases in the costs of our guarantees not covered by our hedging and other capital and risk management strategies may become more significant due to changes in policyholder behavior driven by market conditions or other factors. the above factors, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
our valuation of the liabilities for the minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products requires us to consider the market perception of our risk of non-performance, and a decrease in our own credit spreads resulting from ratings upgrades or other events or market conditions could cause the recorded value of these liabilities to increase, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
liquidity risk as a financial services company, we are exposed to liquidity risk, which is the risk that the company is unable to meet near-term obligations as they come due.
liquidity risk is a manifestation of events that are driven by other risk types (market, insurance, investment, operational). a liquidity shortfall may arise in the event of insufficient funding sources or an immediate and significant need for cash or collateral. in addition, it is possible that expected liquidity sources, such as our credit facilities, may be unavailable or inadequate to satisfy the liquidity demands described below.
the company has four primary sources of liquidity exposure and associated drivers that trigger material liquidity demand. those sources are:
•derivative collateral market exposure: abrupt changes to interest rate, equity, and/or currency markets may increase collateral requirements to counterparties and create liquidity risk for the company.
•asset liability mismatch: there are liquidity risks associated with liabilities coming due prior to the matching asset cash flows. structural maturities mismatch can occur in activities such as securities lending, where the liabilities are effectively overnight open transactions used to fund longer term assets.
•wholesale funding: the company depends upon the financial markets for funding (such as through the issuance of commercial paper, securities lending and repurchase arrangements and other forms of borrowings in the capital markets). these sources might not be available during times of stress, or may only be available on unfavorable terms, which can result in a decrease in our profitability and a significant reduction in our financial flexibility.
•insurance cash flows: the company faces potential liquidity risks from unexpected cash demands due to severe mortality calamity, customer withdrawals or lapse events. if such events were to occur, the company may face unexpectedly high levels of claim payments to policyholders.
for a discussion of the company's liquidity and sources and uses of liquidity, including information about legal and regulatory limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources-liquidity."
operational risk our operations are exposed to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human error or misconduct, and as a result of external events.
an operational risk failure may result in one or more actual or potential impacts to the company. operational risk may be elevated as a result of organizational changes, including recent and planned changes related to the company's business transformation efforts. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-overview" for additional information regarding our business transformation efforts.
operational risk types
•processes: processing failure; failure to safeguard or retain documents/records; errors in valuation/pricing models and processes; project management or execution failures; improper sales practices; improper administration of our products; failure to adhere to clients' investment guidelines.
•systems: failures during the development and implementation of new systems; systems failures.
•people: internal fraud, breaches of employment law, unauthorized activities; loss or lack of key personnel, inadequate training; inadequate supervision.
•external events: external crime; cyber-attack, outsourcing risk; vendor risk; natural and other disasters; changes in laws/regulations.
•legal: legal and regulatory compliance failures. see "business-regulation" for a discussion of the regulations applicable to the company.
potential impacts
•financial losses: the company experiences a financial loss. this loss may originate from various causes including, but not limited to, transaction processing errors and fraud.
•client service impacts: the company may not be able to service customers. this may result if the company is unable to continue operations during a business continuation event or if systems are compromised due to malware or virus.
•regulatory fines or sanctions: when the company fails to comply with applicable laws or regulations, regulatory fines or sanctions may be imposed. in addition, possible restrictions on business activities may result.
•legal actions: failure to comply with laws and regulations also exposes the company to litigation risk. this may also result in financial losses.
•reputational harm: failure to meet regulator, customer, investor and other stakeholder expectations may cause reputational harm.
liabilities we may incur as a result of operational failures are described further under "contingent liabilities" in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. in addition, certain pending regulatory and litigation matters affecting us, and certain risks to our businesses presented by such matters, are discussed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements. we may become subject to additional regulatory and legal actions in the future.
key enterprise operational risks - key enterprise operational risks include, among others, the following:
we are subject to business continuation risk, which is the risk that our operations, systems or data, or those of third-parties on whom we rely, may be disrupted. we may experience a disruption in business continuity as a result of, among other things, the following:
•severe pandemic, epidemic, or other public health crises, either naturally occurring or resulting from intentionally manipulated pathogens;
•geo-political risks, including armed conflict and civil unrest;
•cyber-attacks, both systemic (e.g., affecting the internet, cloud services, and/or other financial services industry infrastructure) and targeted (e.g., failures in or breach of our systems or that of third-parties on whom we rely);
•physical infrastructure outages;
•workforce unavailability resulting from any of the above events, among others.
we depend heavily on our telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and continuing availability of data we use to run our businesses and service our customers. these systems, and any available backups, may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control.
further, we face the risk of operational and technology failures experienced by others, including clearing agents, exchanges and other financial intermediaries, and vendors and other third parties to which we outsource the provision of services or business operations.
we, or third-parties on whom we rely, may not adequately maintain information security. there continues to be significant and increased cyber-attack activity against businesses, including but not limited to the financial services sector, and no organization, regardless of measures implemented to safeguard the systems and detect threats, is fully immune to cyber-attacks. our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of, among other things, the rapidly evolving nature and pervasiveness of cyber threats (including supply-chain attacks), our brand and reputation, our size and scale, our geographic presence and our role in the financial services industry and the broader economy. risks related to cyber-attack arise in various areas, including:
•protecting both "structured" and "unstructured" sensitive information is a constant need; however, some risks cannot be fully mitigated using administrative, technological, or physical controls, or otherwise.
•employees, customers, or other users of our systems continue to be a key avenue for malicious external parties to gain access to our network, systems, data, or that of our customers. many attacks leverage social engineering schemes (such as phishing, vishing, or smishing) to coax an internal user to click on a malicious attachment or link to introduce malware into companies' systems or steal the user's username and password. such social engineering schemes are becoming increasingly sophisticated and sometimes may involve emerging technologies such as deep-fakes. senior-level executives are increasingly becoming the targets of such attacks. fraudulent schemes to solicit information via call centers and interactive voice response systems are becoming more prevalent.
•cyber-attacks involving the encryption and/or threat to disclose personal or confidential information (i.e., ransomware) or disruptions of communications (i.e., denial of service) for the purposes of extortion or other motives persist and are on the rise.
•financial services companies and their third-party service providers (including their downstream service providers) are increasingly being targeted by hackers and fraudulent actors seeking to monetize personal or confidential information to extort money, or for other malicious purposes. such campaigns have targeted online applications and services.
•nation-state sponsored or affiliated organizations are engaged in cyber-attacks, not only for monetization purposes, but also to gain information about foreign citizens and governments, or to influence or cause disruptions in commerce or political affairs. in light of recent geopolitical events, including russia's invasion of ukraine, state-sponsored or affiliated parties and/or their supporters may launch retaliatory cyber-attacks, and may attempt to cause supply chain and other third-party service provider disruptions, or take other geopolitically motivated retaliatory actions that may disrupt our business operations, and/or result in the compromise of our systems or data.
•increasingly, malicious actors can be in companies' systems for an extended period of time before being detected. it could take considerable additional time for us to determine the scope of compromise, and the extent, amount, and type of information compromised, if any, and to fully remediate and recover.
•employees or other individuals purportedly acting on behalf of the company may fail (as a result of human error or misconduct) to comply with applicable policies and procedures, and/or circumvent controls or safeguards for unauthorized purposes.
•we rely on third-parties to provide services, as described further below. while we maintain certain standards for all vendors that provide us services, our vendors, and in turn, their own service providers, may become subject to a security breach, including as a result of their failure to perform in accordance with their contractual obligations.
•hardware, software or applications developed by, obtained from, or implemented in accordance with specifications provided by third parties may contain vulnerabilities in design, maintenance or manufacturing that could be exploited to compromise the company's information security.
•continuing use of remote or flexible work arrangements, including remote access tools and mobile technology (including use of personal devices), have expanded potential attack surfaces.
•the proliferation of third-party financial data aggregators and emerging technologies, including the development and use of artificial intelligence ("ai"), increase our information security risks and exposure.
we, or third-parties on whom we rely, may not adequately ensure the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of personal and confidential information. in the course of our ordinary business, we collect, store and disclose to various third-parties (e.g., service providers, reinsurers, etc.) substantial amounts of personal and confidential information, including in some instances sensitive personal information, including health-related information. we are subject to the risk that the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of this information may be compromised, including as a result of an information security breach described above, or that such events occurring at third-parties may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. we have experienced cybersecurity events resulting in the compromise of personal and confidential information, including sensitive health information, of our customers and other stakeholders. see "business-regulation-privacy and cybersecurity regulation" for a discussion of the applicable laws and regulations (including those requiring notice, disclosure or remediation) relating to cybersecurity events.
we may incur significant costs and other negative consequences resulting from cyber-attacks or other information security breaches. any compromise or perceived compromise of the security of our systems or data or of that of one of our vendors could damage our reputation, cause the deterioration or termination of relationships with, among others, customers, distributors, government-run health insurance exchanges, marketing partners and insurance carriers, reduce demand for our services, result in the loss of business opportunities, and subject us to significant liability and expense as well as regulatory action and lawsuits, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. we may also incur significant costs in connection with our response, recovery, remediation, and compliance efforts. additionally, our failure to timely or accurately communicate cyber incidents to relevant parties could result in regulatory, privacy, operational and reputational risk.
table of contents to the extent we maintain cyber insurance, liabilities or losses arising from certain cyber incidents may not be covered or fully covered under such policies, and the amount of insurance may not be adequate.
third-parties (outsourcing providers, vendors and suppliers and joint venture partners) present added operational risk to our enterprise. the company's business model relies heavily on the use of third-parties to deliver contracted services in a broad range of areas. this presents the risk that the company is unable to meet legal, regulatory, financial or customer obligations because third-parties fail to deliver contracted services, or that the company is exposed to reputational damage because third-parties operate in a poorly controlled manner. we use affiliates and third-party vendors located outside the u.s. to provide certain services and functions, which also exposes us to business disruptions and political risks as a result of risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states. in our investments in which we hold a minority interest, or that are managed by third-parties, we lack management and operational control over operations, which may subject us to additional operational, compliance and legal risks and prevent us from taking or causing to be taken actions to protect or increase the value of those investments. for example, see "business-regulation-erisa". in those jurisdictions where we are constrained by law from owning a majority interest in jointly owned operations, our remedies in the event of a breach by a joint venture partner may be limited (e.g., we may have no ability to exercise a "call" option).
affiliate and third-party distributors of our products present added regulatory, competitive and other risks to our enterprise. our products are sold primarily through our captive/affiliated distributors and third-party distributing firms. our captive/affiliated distributors are made up of large numbers of decentralized sales personnel who are compensated based on commissions. the third-party distributing firms generally are not dedicated to us exclusively and may frequently recommend and/or market products of our competitors. accordingly, we must compete intensely for their services. our sales could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain or motivate third-party distributing firms or if we do not adequately provide support, training, compensation, and education to this sales network regarding our products, or if our products are not competitive and not appropriately aligned with consumer needs. while third-party distributing firms have an independent regulatory accountability, some regulators have been clear with expectations that product manufacturers retain significant sales practices accountability.
the company and our distributors are subject to rules regarding the standard of care applicable to sales of our products and the provision of advice to our customers, and in recent years many of these rules have been revised or re-examined. in addition, there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling financial services products and the payments they receive. furthermore, sales practices and investor protection have increasingly become areas of focus in regulatory examinations. these investigations and examinations have resulted in enforcement actions against us and companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling those companies' products. enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans and/or changes to industry practices, which could adversely affect our ability to market our products. if our products are distributed in an inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, or distributors of our products otherwise engage in misconduct, we may suffer reputational and other harm to our business and be subject to regulatory action, penalties or damages. our business may also be harmed if captive/affiliate distributors engage in inappropriate conduct in connection with the sale of third-party products.
additionally, certain of our affiliated distributors engage in direct marketing to consumers through telemarketing, email marketing and other lead generation activities that subject us to various state and federal laws and regulations, including the telephone consumer protection act and the americans with disabilities act. violations of these regulations could subject our affiliated distributors to litigation and regulatory inquiries that result in penalties or damages.
see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding litigation and regulatory matters relating to the distribution of products.
many of our distribution personnel are independent contractors or franchisees. from time to time, their status has been challenged in courts and by government agencies, and various legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced addressing the criteria for determining the status of independent contractors' classification as employees for, among other things, employment tax purposes or other employment benefits. the costs associated with potential changes with respect to these independent contractor and franchisee classifications have impacted our results previously and could have a material adverse effect on our business in the future.
although we distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution channels, we do maintain relationships with certain key distributors. for example, a significant amount of our sales in japan are derived through four major japanese banks and a significant portion of our sales in japan through life consultants is derived through a single association relationship. we periodically negotiate the terms of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to table of contents us or such third-parties. an interruption in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. distributors may elect to reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us, including for such reasons as adverse developments in our business, competitiveness of product offerings, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. we are also at risk that key distribution partners may merge, change their business models in ways that affect how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, or that new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact the effectiveness of our distribution efforts. an increase in bank and broker-dealer consolidation activity could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market products through these channels. consolidation of distributors and/or other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to terms less favorable to us. finally, we also may be challenged by new technologies and marketplace entrants that could interfere with our existing relationships.
as a financial services company, we are exposed to model risk, which is the risk of financial loss or reputational damage or adverse regulatory impacts caused by model errors or limitations, incorrect implementation of models, or misuse of or overreliance upon models. models are utilized by our businesses and corporate areas primarily to project future cash flows associated with pricing products, calculating reserves and valuing assets, as well as in evaluating risk and determining capital requirements, among other uses. these models may not operate properly and may rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. as our businesses continue to grow and evolve, the number and complexity of models we utilize expands, increasing our exposure to error in the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated input data and assumptions. furthermore, model risk will be elevated during periods of transformation or due to new or changing laws or regulations (e.g., accounting standards update ("asu") 2018-12, financial services - insurance (topic 944): targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts).
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. we rely on a combination of contractual rights with employees and third-parties and on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we endeavor to protect our rights, third-parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. this would represent a diversion of resources that may be significant, and our efforts may not prove successful. the inability to secure, protect or retain our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.
we may be subject to claims by third-parties for (i) copyright, trademark or patent infringement; (ii) breach of copyright, trademark or license usage rights; or (iii) misappropriation of trade secrets. any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could in some circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses. alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third-parties or implement a costly work around. any of these scenarios could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
strategic risk we are subject to the risk of events that can cause our fundamental business model to change, either through a shift in the businesses in which we are engaged or a change in our execution.
in addition, other risks may become strategic risks. for example, we have considered and must continue to consider the impact of the interest rate environment on new product development and continued sales of interest sensitive products.
actions by foreign governments could adversely affect the value and long-term growth prospects of our businesses, particularly in emerging markets. for example, pension system reforms being proposed in some jurisdictions (including chile, columbia and peru) may limit the role of private companies, fundamentally changing our business in these markets. likewise, geopolitical tensions (including those between china and taiwan) may cause governments to take actions such as the implementation of sanctions or other measures to restrict commercial activity in or among markets where we operate or have other interests. the timing and magnitude of any potential actions is uncertain, as is the effectiveness of any measures we may take to help limit the impact of these actions.
changes in the regulatory landscape may be unsettling to our business model. new laws and regulations are being considered in the u.s. and our other countries of operation at an increasing pace, as there has been greater scrutiny on financial regulation over the past several years. proposed or unforeseen changes in law or regulation, or changes in the way existing laws or regulations are enforced, may adversely impact our business. see "business-regulation" for a discussion of certain recently table of contents enacted and pending proposals by international, federal and state regulatory authorities and their potential impact on our business, including in the following areas:
•financial sector regulatory reform.
•our regulation under u.s. state insurance laws and developments regarding group-wide supervision and capital standards, accounting rules, rbc factors for invested assets and reserves for life insurance, variable annuities and other products.
•insurer capital standards in japan and other non-u.s. jurisdictions.
•privacy, big data, ai and cybersecurity regulation.
changes in accounting rules applicable to our business may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. for a discussion of accounting pronouncements and their potential impact on our business, including asu 2018-12, financial services - insurance (topic 944): targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
changes in technology and other external factors may be unsettling to our business model. we believe the following aspects of technological and other changes would significantly impact our business model. there may be other unforeseen changes in technology and the external environment, including the regulatory response to technological change, which may have a significant impact on our business model.
•interaction with customers. technology is moving rapidly and as it does, it puts pressure on existing business models. some of the changes we can anticipate are increased choices about how customers want to interact with the company or how they want the company to interact with them. evolving customer preferences and changing privacy regulations may drive a need to redesign products and change the way we interact with customers. our distribution channels may change to become more automated, at the place and time of the customer's choosing. such changes clearly have the potential to disrupt our business model.
•investment portfolio. technology may have a significant impact on the companies in which the company invests. for example, environmental concerns spur scientific inquiry which may reposition the relative attractiveness of wind or sun power over oil and gas. the transportation industry may favor alternative modes of conveyance of goods which may shift trucking or air transport out of favor. consumers may change their purchasing behavior to favor online activity which would change the role of malls and retail properties.
•medical advances. the company is exposed to the impact of medical advances in two major ways. genetic testing and the availability of that information unequally to consumers and insurers can bring anti-selection risks. specifically, data from genetic testing can give our prospective customers a clearer view into their future, allowing them to select products protecting them against likelihoods of mortality or longevity with more precision. also, technologies that extend lives will challenge our actuarial assumptions especially in the annuity-based businesses.
the following items are examples of other factors which could have a meaningful impact on our business.
•a downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could potentially, among other things, adversely impact our business prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. for a discussion of our ratings and the potential impact of a ratings downgrade on our business, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources-ratings." we cannot predict what additional actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without notice by any rating agency. credit rating agencies continually review their methodologies, including capital and earnings assessment models, as well as their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. the credit rating agencies also evaluate the industry as a whole and may change our credit rating based on their overall view of our industry. in addition, a sovereign downgrade could result in a downgrade of our subsidiaries operating in that jurisdiction, and ultimately of prudential financial and our other subsidiaries.
•the changing competitive landscape may adversely affect the company. in each of our businesses, we face intense competition from insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions, both for the ultimate customers for our products and, in many businesses, for distribution through non-affiliated distribution channels. technological advances, changing customer expectations, including related to digital offerings, access to customer data, or other changes in the marketplace may present opportunities for new or smaller companies table of contents without established products or distribution channels to meet consumers' increased expectations more efficiently than us. fintech and insurtech companies and companies in other industries with greater access to customers and data have the potential to disrupt industries globally, and many participants have been partially funded by industry players. for example, in pgim, we expect to see continued pressure on fees given the focus on passive investment and the growth of the robo-advice channel.
•climate change may increase the severity and frequency of calamities, or adversely affect our investment portfolio or investor sentiment. climate change may increase the frequency and severity of weather-related disasters and pandemics. in addition, climate change regulation may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities we hold, or our willingness to continue to hold their securities. it may also impact other counterparties, including reinsurers, and affect the value of investments, including real estate investments we hold or manage for others. we cannot predict the long-term impacts on us from climate change or related regulation. climate change may also influence investor sentiment with respect to the company and investments in our portfolio.
•we may fail to meet expectations relating to environmental, social, and governance standards and practices. certain existing or potential investors, customers and regulators evaluate our business or other practices according to a variety of environmental, social and governance ("esg") standards and expectations. certain of our regulators have proposed or adopted, or may propose or adopt, esg rules or standards that would apply to our business. our practices may be judged by esg standards that are continually evolving and not always clear. prevailing esg standards and expectations may also reflect contrasting or conflicting values or agendas. we may fail to meet our commitments or targets, and our policies and processes to evaluate and manage esg standards in coordination with other business priorities may not be completely effective or satisfy investors, customers, regulators, or others. we may face adverse regulatory, investor, customer, media, or public scrutiny leading to business, reputational, or legal challenges.
•market conditions and other factors may adversely impact product sales or increase expenses. examples include:
◦a change in market conditions, such as higher inflation and higher interest rates, like we started to see in 2022, could cause a change in consumer sentiment and behavior adversely affecting sales and persistency of our savings and protection products. conversely, low inflation and low interest rates could cause persistency of these products to vary from that anticipated and adversely affect profitability. similarly, changing economic conditions and unfavorable public perception of financial institutions can influence customer behavior, including increasing claims or surrenders in certain products.
◦sales of our investment-based and asset management products and services may decline, and lapses and surrenders of certain insurance products and withdrawals of assets from investment products may increase if a market downturn, increased market volatility or other market conditions result in customers becoming dissatisfied with their investments or products.
◦changes in our discount rate, expected rate of return, life expectancy, health care cost and assumptions regarding compensation increases for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.
•geopolitical risk, rapidly rising interest rates and significant equity market declines, as we have seen since the first half of 2022, among other factors, adversely impact our liquidity and capital positions, cash flows, results of operations, and financial position. for additional information, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - overview - current market conditions."
•our reputation may be adversely impacted if any of the risks described in this section are realized. reputational risk could manifest from any of the risks as identified in the company's risk identification process. failure to effectively manage risks across a broad range of risk issues exposes the company to reputational harm. if the company were to suffer a significant loss in reputation, both policyholders and counterparties could seek to exit existing relationships. additionally, large changes in credit worthiness, especially credit ratings, could impact access to funding markets while creating additional collateral requirements for existing relationships. the mismanagement of any such risks may potentially damage our reputational asset. our business is anchored in the strength of our brand, our alignment to our values, and our proven commitment to keep our promises to our customers. any negative public perception, founded or otherwise, can be widely and rapidly shared over social media or other means, and could cause damage to our reputation.
•risks related to covid-19 could reemerge. beginning with its emergence in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic increased or caused the manifestation of many of the risks discussed above, including, among others: the risk of loss on our investments, the risk of elevated mortality or morbidity, and the risk of market disruptions and volatility. the consequences of covid-19 to our business have included the suspension of our stock repurchase program from april 2020 until february 2021, volatility in our investment portfolio during 2020, and a significant net negative impact on our underwriting results in 2021 and 2022. we have discussed these impacts, and others, in the section entitled management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in each of our quarterly reports on form 10-q and annual reports on form 10-k filed since the first quarter of 2020. on the basis of what we currently understand about the impact of covid-19, we believe the risks it poses to our business will remain manageable but the risks relating to covid-19 could reemerge if the course of the pandemic deviates from our current expectations and could also manifest in the event of future pandemics, epidemics or other public health crises.

overview we have operations primarily in the united states of america ("u.s."), asia, europe and latin america. through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we offer a wide array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement solutions, mutual funds and investment management. we offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry.
in october 2021, we announced the creation of retirement strategies, a new u.s. business that would serve the retirement needs of both our institutional and individual customers by bringing the institutional investment and pension solutions offered through our retirement business together with the financial solutions and capabilities of our individual annuities business. commencing with the second quarter of 2022, this new structure has been fully operationalized; therefore, the results of our former retirement segment (now known as the "institutional retirement strategies" operating segment) and our former individual annuities segment (now known as the "individual retirement strategies" operating segment) have been aggregated into the retirement strategies segment. prior periods have been updated to conform to this new presentation.
our principal operations consist of pgim (our global investment management business), our u.s. businesses (consisting of our retirement strategies, group insurance, individual life and assurance iq businesses), our international businesses, the closed block division, and our corporate and other operations. the closed block division is accounted for as a divested business that is reported separately from the divested and run-off businesses that are included in corporate and other. divested and run-off businesses are composed of businesses that have been, or will be, sold or exited, including businesses that have been placed in wind-down status that do not qualify for "discontinued operations" accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap"). our corporate and other operations include corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments as well as the divested and run-off businesses described above. see "business-" for a description of our sources of revenue and details on how our profitability is impacted. in addition, our profitability is impacted by our ability to effectively deploy capital, utilize our tax capacity and manage expenses.
management expects that results in 2023 will continue to benefit from our differentiated mix of market-leading businesses that complement each other to provide competitive advantages, earnings diversification and capital benefits from a balanced risk profile. we believe we are well-positioned to tap into market opportunities to meet the evolving needs of individual customers, workplace clients, and society at large. our mix of high-quality protection, retirement and investment management businesses enables us to offer solutions that cover a broad range of financial needs and to engage with our clients through multiple channels. we aim to expand our addressable market, build deeper and longer-lasting relationships with customers and clients, and meaningfully improve their financial wellness.
in order to become more competitive, we are working to enhance the experience of our customers and the capabilities of our businesses, which we expect will improve margins. in 2019, we launched programs in pursuit of these objectives that have resulted and will continue to result in multi-year investments in technology and employee reskilling, as well as severance and related charges. in 2022, we incurred approximately $145 million of costs in connection with these programs. we expect these programs will generate significant expense efficiencies over several years that will mitigate the impact from increases in other expenses due to inflation and business growth initiatives. as of december 31, 2022, we have exceeded $750 million of annual run-rate cost savings, one year ahead of our target date.
since the first quarter of 2020, the covid-19 pandemic has caused extreme stress and disruption in the global economy and financial markets and elevated mortality and morbidity for the global population. the covid-19 pandemic impacted our results of operations in the current period and could continue to impact our results of operations in future periods.
throughout the pandemic, covid-19 had a significant net negative impact on our underwriting results, reflecting unfavorable mortality and morbidity impacts in our group insurance, individual life and international businesses, partially offset by favorable mortality impacts in the institutional portion of our retirement strategies business. beginning with the third quarter of 2022, the company has embedded covid-19 considerations within its best estimate assumptions of future expected mortality impacts for its applicable businesses. the ultimate impact on our underwriting results, however, will continue to depend on various factors including: an insured's age; geographic concentration; insured versus uninsured populations among the fatalities; the transmissibility and virulence of the virus, including the potential for further mutation; and the ongoing acceptance and efficacy of the vaccines and other therapeutics.
in addition, other covid-19 related impacts are discussed in the following sections of this document:
•business outlooks. see "-outlook" for a discussion of specific outlook considerations for each of our businesses, including any impacts related to covid-19.
•results of operations by segment. see "-results of operations by segment" for a discussion of covid-19 impacts on segment results, where applicable.
•risk management. see "-risk management-covid-19" for a discussion of our risk management framework and its incorporation of pandemic stress scenarios.
•risk factors. see "risk factors" for a discussion of the risks to our businesses posed by the covid-19 pandemic.
outlook we feel confident about our prospects for the future based on the foundation of our integrated and complementary businesses. we plan to continue our transformation towards becoming less market-sensitive, including efforts to further de-risk, such as through reinsurance transactions, and to deliver sustainable long-term growth, including through investing in products and solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers. our plan remains to reallocate capital across the businesses with the intention of increasing the earnings contribution from our higher-growth businesses and reducing capital allocated to lower-growth, more capital-intensive businesses.
specific outlook considerations for each of our businesses include the following:
•pgim. our global investment management business, pgim, is focused on maintaining strong investment performance while leveraging the scale of its approximately $1.228 trillion of assets under management and diversified global operations. we are broadening our distribution channels and asset management capabilities through acquisitions and organic initiatives to better serve our clients and support growth. in addition to serving third-party clients, we provide our u.s. and international businesses with a competitive advantage through our investment expertise across a broad array of asset classes, including public and private asset class capabilities. underpinning our growth strategy is our ability to continue to deliver robust investment performance and to attract and retain high-caliber investment talent.
there remain risks to earnings across the asset management industry as adverse changes in market conditions (e.g., market declines, higher rates or credit spread widening) could lead to lower fee-based revenues, incentive fees taking longer to be realized and losses in our seed and co-investments. an economic downturn could also have impacts on real estate prices as well as transaction volumes in certain private asset classes. we believe pgim's uniquely diversified global platform is well positioned to be resilient in the face of market and industry headwinds.
•retirement strategies. we remain focused on helping customers meet their investment and retirement needs. consistent with the company's strategy of becoming higher growth and less market sensitive, the sales of our full service retirement business and a portion of our traditional variable annuity block of business were completed in the second quarter of 2022. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these dispositions. our remaining institutional retirement strategies business continues to be focused on providing products that respond to the needs of plan sponsors, retirees, and annuitants to manage risk and control their benefit costs while maintaining appropriate pricing and return expectations under changing market conditions. we expect our differentiated capabilities and demonstrated execution to drive our business momentum in the pension risk transfer and international reinsurance markets; however, we expect that growth will not be linear due to the episodic nature of these transactions. in individual retirement strategies, we continue to execute on our strategy to pivot to less interest rate-sensitive products to ensure we realize appropriate returns within the current economic environment. we expect to continue to shift our focus to products that provide protected outcomes for our customers across a wide range of economic environments through simpler, technology-enabled channels. we expect account values, fee income, and spread income to be impacted by volatile market conditions.
•group insurance. we are a leading group benefits provider with a focus on further diversifying our portfolio by expanding our premier and association segments and growing voluntary supplemental health, while maintaining leadership in the national segment.
•individual life. we continue to focus on making life insurance solutions more accessible to financial professionals and direct customers by providing a broad product portfolio, including growing the amount of accumulation and simplified protection product options, coupled with our multi-channel distribution capabilities. we have taken pricing and product actions to ensure we realize appropriate returns for the current economic environment and to diversify our product mix to further limit our sensitivity to interest rates.
•assurance iq. we remain focused on expanding our addressable market and increasing access to more retail customers through our agent and digital channels. we continue to expand carriers and product offerings on our platform in an effort to meet our customers' evolving needs.
•international businesses. we remain focused on meeting customers' protection and financial needs as well as maintaining the underlying strength of our distribution channels. our strategy is to maintain and strengthen our position in japan while expanding our footprint in select high-growth emerging markets. we believe our needs-based selling and death protection focus are even more valuable to consumers based on the global experience of covid-19 and will help support the continued long-term growth of our businesses. we continue to invest in our existing businesses and regularly assess acquisition opportunities to build scale and complement our businesses in support of our long-term growth. we recently expanded into south africa by acquiring a 33% ownership interest in alexander forbes group holdings limited.
industry trends our u.s. and international businesses are impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of trends that affect the industries in which we compete.
financial and economic environment:
•u.s. businesses. as discussed further under "-impact of changes in the interest rate environment" below, interest rates in the u.s. have experienced a sustained period of historically low levels, followed by a sharp rise in 2022. we expect that a continued level of higher interest rates will benefit our results over time. we continue to monitor current market conditions and the impact to our businesses from slowing or negative economic growth. in addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in equity markets and the evolution of the credit cycle as discussed in "-segment results of operations", where applicable, and more broadly in "item 1a. risk factors".
•international businesses. our international businesses' operations, especially in japan, have operated in a low interest rate environment for many years, as discussed under "-impact of changes in the interest rate environment" below, and these low interest rates negatively impact our net investment spread results and reinvestment yields. in addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in foreign currency rates, particularly the japanese yen. fluctuations in the value of the yen can impact the relative attractiveness to customers of both yen-denominated and non-yen denominated products thereby impacting both sales and surrenders.
table of contents in addition, we are subject to financial impacts associated with movements in equity markets and the evolution of the credit cycle as discussed in "-segment results of operations", where applicable, and more broadly in "item 1a. risk factors".
•u.s. businesses. customer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different consumer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. consumer expectations and preferences are changing. we believe existing and potential customers are increasingly looking for cost-effective solutions that they can easily understand and access through technology-enabled devices. at the same time, income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry. a persistent retirement security gap exists in terms of both savings and protection. despite the ongoing shift of the risk and responsibility of retirement savings from employers to employees, employers are increasingly focusing on the financial wellness of their employees.
•international businesses. japan has an aging population as well as a large pool of household assets invested in low-yielding deposit and savings vehicles. the aging of japan's population, along with strains on government pension and healthcare programs, have led to a growing demand for products that provide financial solutions for retirement and wealth transfer, as well as for health-related products.

current market conditions geopolitical risk, rapidly rising interest rates and significant equity market declines, as we saw throughout 2022, among other factors, adversely impact our liquidity and capital positions, cash flows, results of operations, and financial position. the statutory capital of certain of our insurance subsidiaries will also be negatively affected by increased reserve requirements due to our annual update of actuarial assumptions and other refinements, particularly in our individual life business, and will be negatively affected by asymmetrical and non-economic statutory accounting impacts from rising rates. as we navigate through the current environment, we may take actions consistent with our risk and capital frameworks, as necessary, to preserve our liquidity and capital positions. for additional information on how these conditions may also impact our income taxes, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
impact of changes in the interest rate environment as a global financial services company, market interest rates are a key driver of our liquidity and capital positions, cash flows, results of operations and financial position. changes in interest rates can affect these in several ways, including favorable or adverse impacts to:
•investment-related activity, including: investment income returns, net investment spread results, new money rates, mortgage loan prepayments and bond redemptions;
•the valuation of fixed income investments and derivative instruments;
•collateral posting requirements, hedging costs and other risk mitigation activities;
•customer account values and assets under management, including their impacts on fee-related income;
•insurance reserve levels, market experience true-ups and amortization of both deferred policy acquisition costs ("dac") and value of business acquired ("voba");
•policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity;
•product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and
•the fair value of, and possible impairments on, intangible assets such as goodwill.
see "-current market conditions" above, for how rapidly rising interest rates, among other factors, adversely impact the company's financial results. for additional information regarding interest rate risks, see "risk factors-market risk".
table of contents see below for a discussion of the current interest rate environment and its impact to net investment spread in our u.s. and japanese operations along with the composition of their insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances.
u.s. operations excluding the closed block division while interest rates in the u.s. have experienced a sustained period of historically low levels in recent years, rates increased throughout 2022 and our average reinvestment yield is generally now exceeding our current average portfolio yield.
in order to manage the impacts that changes in interest rates have on our net investment spread, we employ a proactive asset/liability management program, which includes strategic asset allocation and hedging strategies within a disciplined risk management framework. these strategies seek to match the characteristics of our products, and to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities. our asset/liability management program also helps manage duration gaps, currency and other risks between assets and liabilities through the use of derivatives. we adjust this dynamic process as products change, as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur. as a result, our asset/liability management process has permitted us to manage the interest rate risk associated with our products through several market cycles. our interest rate exposure is also mitigated by our business mix, which includes lines of business for which fee-based and insurance underwriting earnings play a more prominent role in product profitability. we also regularly examine our product offerings and their profitability. as a result, we may reprice certain products and discontinue sales of other products that do not meet our profit expectations.
the portion of the general account supporting our u.s. businesses and our corporate and other operations has approximately $178 billion of fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans (based on net carrying value) as of december 31, 2022, with an average portfolio yield of approximately 4.3%. for the portion of the general account attributable to these operations, we estimate annual principal payments and prepayments that we would be required to reinvest to be approximately 7.7% of the fixed maturity security and commercial mortgage loan portfolios through 2024.
included in the $178 billion of fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans are approximately $142 billion that are subject to call or redemption features at the issuer's option and have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4%. of this $142 billion, approximately 55% contain provisions for prepayment premiums. future operating results will be impacted by (i) the reinvestment of scheduled payments or prepayments (not subject to a prepayment fee) at different rates compared to the current portfolio yield, including in some cases at rates below those guaranteed under our insurance contracts, and (ii) our utilization of other asset/liability management strategies, as described above, in order to maintain favorable net investment spread.
the following table sets forth the insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances of our u.s. operations excluding the closed block division, by type, for the date indicated:
long-duration insurance products with fixed and guaranteed terms                                            $156
contracts with adjustable crediting rates subject to guaranteed minimums                                      36
participating contracts where investment income risk ultimately accrues to contractholders                     2
the $156 billion above relates to long-duration products such as group annuities, structured settlements and other insurance products that have fixed and guaranteed terms. we seek to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on these contracts through asset/liability management, as discussed above.
the $36 billion above relates to contracts with crediting rates that may be adjusted over the life of the contract, subject to guaranteed minimums. although we may have the ability to lower crediting rates for those contracts above guaranteed minimums, our willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures. the following table sets forth the related account values by range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates and the related range of the difference, in basis points ("bps"), between rates being credited to contractholders as of december 31, 2022, and the respective guaranteed minimums.
table of contents account values with adjustable crediting rates subject to guaranteed minimums:
range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates:
(1)includes approximately $0.2 billion related to contracts that impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity.
the remaining $2 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances in these operations relates to participating contracts for which the investment income risk is expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. the crediting rates for these contracts are periodically adjusted based on the return earned on the related assets.
closed block division substantially all of the $49 billion of general account assets in the closed block division support obligations and liabilities relating to the closed block policies only. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the closed block.
japanese operations japan has experienced a low interest rate environment for many years. in recent years, the bank of japan's monetary policy has resulted in even lower and, at times, negative yields for certain tenors of government bonds; however, their monetary policy was eased in the fourth quarter of 2022, which led to an increase in rates.
in order to manage, to the extent possible, the impact that the current interest rate environment has on our net investment spread, our japanese operations employ a proactive asset/liability management program. we continue to purchase long-term bonds with tenors of 30 years or greater. we also regularly examine our product offerings and their profitability. as a result, we may reprice certain products, adjust commissions for certain products and discontinue sales of other products that do not meet our profit expectations. additionally, our diverse product portfolio in terms of currency mix and premium payment structure allows us to further manage any impacts from changes in the interest rate environment. our japanese operations have continued to invest in u.s. dollar-denominated assets supporting our u.s. dollar-denominated product portfolio, which has now driven average reinvestment rates to exceed current average portfolio rates. for additional information regarding sales within these operations, see "-international businesses-sales results," below.
the portion of the general account supporting our japanese operations has approximately $152 billion of fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans (based on net carrying value) as of december 31, 2022, with an average portfolio yield of approximately 2.6%. for the portion of the general account attributable to these operations, we estimate annual principal payments and prepayments that we would be required to reinvest to be approximately 6.4% of the fixed maturity security and commercial mortgage loan portfolios through 2024.
included in the $152 billion of fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans are approximately $16 billion that are subject to call or redemption features at the issuer's option and have a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4%. of this $16 billion, approximately 7% contain provisions for prepayment premiums. future operating results will be impacted by (i) the reinvestment of scheduled payments or prepayments (not subject to a prepayment fee) at different rates compared to the current portfolio yield, including in some cases at rates below those guaranteed under our insurance contracts, and (ii) our utilization of other asset/liability management strategies, as described above, in order to maintain favorable net investment spread.
table of contents the following table sets forth the insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances of our japanese operations, by type, for the date indicated:
insurance products with fixed and guaranteed terms                                                 $130
contracts with a market value adjustment if invested amount is not held to maturity                  25
contracts with adjustable crediting rates subject to guaranteed minimums                             10
the $130 billion is primarily comprised of long-duration insurance products that have fixed and guaranteed terms, for which underlying assets may have to be reinvested at interest rates that are lower than current portfolio yields. the remaining insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances include $25 billion related to contracts that impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity and $10 billion related to contracts with crediting rates that may be adjusted over the life of the contract, subject to guaranteed minimums. most of the current crediting rates on these contracts, however, are at or near contractual minimums. although we have the ability in some cases to lower crediting rates for those contracts that are above guaranteed minimum crediting rates, the majority of this business has interest crediting rates that are determined by formula.

2022 to 2021 annual comparison. the $9,162 million decrease in "net income (loss) attributable to prudential financial, inc." reflected the following notable items on a pre-tax basis:
•$6,878 million unfavorable variance from realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments for pfi, excluding the impact of the hedging program associated with certain variable annuities;
•$2,651 million unfavorable variance from lower adjusted operating income from our business segments, including an unfavorable net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, primarily within the individual life business, and the absence of a gain from the sale of the company's 35% ownership stake in pramerica sgr recorded in the prior year period, partially offset by a gain from the sale of palac;
•$950 million unfavorable variance reflecting the impact from changes in the value of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions, net of dac and other costs, associated with certain variable annuities; and
•$879 million unfavorable variance reflecting lower results from our divested and run-off businesses in the current year period, partially offset by a gain from the sale of our full service retirement business.
partially offsetting these decreases in "net income (loss) attributable to prudential financial, inc." was a $2,044 million favorable variance from income taxes reflecting the decrease in pre-tax earnings.

segment results for 2022 presented above reflect the following:
pgim. results for 2022 decreased in comparison to 2021, primarily reflecting the absence of a gain in the prior year period from the sale of our 35% ownership stake in pramerica sgr, and lower net other related revenues and net asset management fees.
retirement strategies. results for 2022 increased in comparison to 2021, inclusive of a favorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding this item, results increased, primarily table of contents driven by the gain on sale of palac, lower expenses and market value gains on a strategic investment, partially offset by lower fee income, net of distribution expenses and other associated costs, and lower net investment spread results.
group insurance. results for 2022 increased in comparison to 2021, inclusive of an unfavorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding this item, results increased, primarily driven by higher underwriting results, partially offset by lower net investment spread results.
individual life. results for 2022 decreased in comparison to 2021, inclusive of an unfavorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding this item, results decreased, primarily driven by lower net investment spread results, partially offset by higher underwriting results.
assurance iq. results for 2022 increased in comparison to 2021, inclusive of an unfavorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding this item, results increased, primarily driven by an increase in the medicare line, partially offset by a decrease in the health under 65 line.
international businesses. results for 2022 decreased in comparison to 2021, inclusive of an unfavorable net impact from foreign currency exchange rates and an unfavorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding these items, results decreased, primarily driven by lower net investment spread results, lower underwriting results and lower earnings from joint venture investments.
corporate and other. results for 2022 reflected decreased losses in comparison to 2021, primarily driven by favorable pension and employee benefit results and lower net charges from other corporate activities.
closed block division. results for 2022 decreased in comparison to 2021, primarily driven by lower net investment activity results, partially offset by a reduction in the policyholder dividend obligation.
segment measures adjusted operating income. in managing our business, we analyze our segments' operating performance using "adjusted operating income." adjusted operating income does not equate to "income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures" or "net income (loss)" as determined in accordance with u.s. gaap but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and, consistent with authoritative guidance, is our measure of segment performance. the adjustments to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with u.s. gaap, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies; however, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating income.
annualized new business premiums. in managing our individual life, group insurance and international businesses segments, we analyze annualized new business premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under u.s. gaap. annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the business, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies written in prior years and net investment income, in addition to current sales. annualized new business premiums include 10% of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products. no other adjustments are made for limited pay contracts.
the amount of annualized new business premiums for any given period can be significantly impacted by several factors, including but not limited to: addition of new products, discontinuation of existing products, changes in credited interest rates for certain products and other product modifications, changes in premium rates, changes in tax laws, changes in regulations or changes in the competitive environment. sales volume may increase or decrease prior to certain of these changes becoming effective, and then fluctuate in the other direction following such changes.
assets under management. in managing our pgim segment, we analyze assets under management (which do not correspond directly to u.s. gaap assets) because the principal source of revenues is fees based on assets under management. assets under management represent the fair market value or account value of assets that we manage directly for institutional clients, retail clients, and for our general account, as well as assets invested in our products that are managed by third-party managers.
table of contents account values. in managing our retirement strategies segment, we analyze account values, which do not correspond directly to u.s. gaap assets. net additions (withdrawals) in our institutional retirement strategies business and sales (redemptions) in our individual retirement strategies business do not correspond to revenues under u.s. gaap but are used as a relevant measure of business activity.
impact of foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange rate movements and related hedging strategies as a u.s.-based company with significant business operations outside the u.s., particularly in japan, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements that could impact our u.s. dollar ("usd")-equivalent shareholder return on equity. we seek to mitigate this impact through various hedging strategies, including holding usd-denominated assets in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
in order to reduce equity volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements, we primarily utilize a yen hedging strategy that calibrates the hedge level to preserve the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the company's overall return on equity on a leverage neutral basis. we implement this hedging strategy utilizing a variety of instruments, including usd-denominated assets and dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments held locally in our japanese insurance subsidiaries. the total hedge level may vary based on our periodic assessment of the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the company's overall return on equity.
the table below presents the aggregate amount of instruments that serve to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our usd-equivalent shareholder return on equity from our japanese insurance subsidiaries as of the dates indicated.
foreign currency hedging instruments:
usd-denominated assets held in yen-based entities(1)                       $7.8                      $9.5
dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments(2)                    0.4       0.5
total foreign currency hedges                                              $8.2                     $10.0
(1)includes usd-denominated fixed maturities at amortized cost plus any related accrued investment income, as well as usd notional amount of foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding. note this amount represents only those usd assets serving to hedge the impact of foreign currency volatility on equity. separate from this program, our japanese operations also have $70.1 billion and $74.3 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of usd-denominated assets supporting usd-denominated liabilities related to usd-denominated products.
(2)dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments are held by our yen-based entities in the form of fixed maturities and loans with a yen-denominated principal component and usd-denominated interest income. the amounts shown represent the present value of future usd-denominated cash flows.
the usd-denominated investments that hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on usd-equivalent shareholder return on equity from our japanese insurance operations are reported within yen-based entities and, as a result, foreign currency exchange rate movements will impact their value reported within our yen-based japanese insurance entities. we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will decrease the value of these usd-denominated investments reported within our yen-based japanese insurance entities, and therefore negatively impact their equity and regulatory solvency margins, by having our japanese insurance operations enter into currency hedging transactions with a subsidiary of prudential financial. these hedging strategies have the economic effect of moving the change in value of these usd-denominated investments due to foreign currency exchange rate movements from our japanese yen-based entities to our usd-based entities.
these usd-denominated investments also pay a coupon which is generally higher than what a similar yen-denominated investment would pay. the incremental impact of this higher yield on our usd-denominated investments, as well as our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments, will vary over time, and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investments as well as interest rate environments in both the u.s. and japan at the time of the investments.
table of contents impact of intercompany foreign currency exchange rate arrangements on segment results of operations the financial results of our international businesses and pgim reflect the impact of intercompany arrangements with our corporate and other operations pursuant to which these segments' non-usd-denominated earnings are translated at fixed currency exchange rates. results of our corporate and other operations include differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segments at the fixed currency exchange rate versus the actual average rate during the period. in addition, specific to our international businesses where we hedge certain currencies, the results of our corporate and other operations also include the impact of any gains or losses recorded from the forward currency contracts that settled during the period, which include the impact of any over or under hedging of actual earnings that differ from projected earnings.
for our international businesses, the fixed currency exchange rates are generally determined in connection with a foreign currency income hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of exchange rate changes on the segment's expected usd-equivalent earnings. pursuant to this program, our corporate and other operations execute forward currency contracts with third-parties to sell the net exposure of projected earnings for certain currencies in exchange for usd at specified exchange rates. the maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods (typically on a three-year rolling basis) in which the identified non-usd-denominated earnings are expected to be generated.
for our international businesses and pgim, the fixed currency exchange rates for the current year are predetermined during the third quarter of the prior year using forward currency exchange rates.
the table below presents, for the periods indicated, the increase (decrease) to revenues and adjusted operating income for the international businesses, pgim and corporate and other operations, reflecting the impact of these intercompany arrangements.

(2)as of december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amounts of these forward currency contracts within our corporate and other operations were $0.7 billion, $0.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
impact of products denominated in non-local currencies on u.s. gaap earnings while our international insurance operations offer products denominated in local currency, several also offer products denominated in non-local currencies. this is most notable in our japanese operations, which currently offer primarily usd-denominated products, but have also historically offered australian dollar ("aud")-denominated products. the non-local currency-denominated insurance liabilities related to these products are supported by investments denominated in corresponding currencies, including a significant portion designated as available-for-sale. while the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements on these non-local currency-denominated assets and liabilities is economically matched, differences in the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements have historically resulted in volatility in u.s. gaap earnings.
as a result, we implemented a structure in gibraltar life's operations that disaggregated the usd- and aud-denominated businesses into separate divisions, each with its own functional currency that aligns with the underlying products and investments. the result of this alignment was to reduce differences in the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities that arise due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements. for the usd- and aud-denominated assets that were transferred under this structure, the net cumulative unrealized investment gains associated with foreign exchange remeasurement that were recorded in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" ("aoci") totaled $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and will be recognized in earnings within "realized table of contents investment gains (losses), net" over time as these assets mature or are sold. absent the sale of any of these assets prior to their stated maturity, approximately 8% of the $1.6 billion balance as of december 31, 2022 will be recognized in 2023, approximately 8% will be recognized in 2024, and the remaining balance will be recognized from 2025 through 2051.
highly inflationary economy in argentina our insurance operations in argentina, prudential of argentina ("poa"), have historically utilized the argentine peso as the functional currency given it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. during 2018, argentina experienced a cumulative inflation rate that exceeded 100% over a 3-year period. as a result, argentina's economy was deemed to be highly inflationary, resulting in reporting changes effective july 1, 2018. under u.s. gaap, the financial statements of a foreign entity in a highly inflationary economy are to be remeasured as if its functional currency (formerly the argentine peso) is the reporting currency of its parent reporting entity (the usd) on a prospective basis. while this changed how the results of poa are remeasured and/or translated into usd, the impact to our financial statements was not material nor is it expected to be material in future periods given the relative size of our poa operations. it should also be noted that due to the macroeconomic environment in argentina, the majority of poa's balance sheet consists of usd-denominated product liabilities supported by usd-denominated assets. as a result, this accounting change serves to reduce the remeasurement impact reflected in net income given that the functional currency and currency in which the assets and liabilities are denominated will be more closely aligned.
accounting policies & pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. management, on an ongoing basis, reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements. if management determines that modifications to assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, the company's results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly.
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
insurance assets deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements we capitalize costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance and annuity contracts. these costs primarily include commissions, as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. we have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements related to variable and fixed annuity contracts primarily within the individual portion of our retirement strategies segment. sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholders' account balances mainly as an incentive to purchase the contract. for additional information about sales inducements, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. we generally amortize dac and deferred sales inducements ("dsi") over the expected lives of the contracts, based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross premiums, gross profits, or gross margins, depending on the type of contract. as described in more detail below, in calculating dac and dsi amortization, we are required to make assumptions about investment returns, mortality, persistency, and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross premiums, gross profits, or gross margins. we also periodically evaluate the recoverability of our dac and dsi. for certain contracts, this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing, as discussed further below in "-insurance liabilities-future policy benefits." as of december 31, 2022, dac and dsi for pfi excluding the closed block division were $19.3 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, and dac in our closed block division was $0.2 billion.
amortization methodologies gross premiums. dac, associated with the non-participating term life policies of our individual life segment and the whole life, term life, endowment and health policies of our international businesses segment, is primarily amortized in proportion to gross premiums. gross premiums are defined as the premiums charged to a policyholder for an insurance contract.
gross profits. dac and dsi, associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life and international businesses segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our retirement strategies and international businesses segments, are generally amortized over the expected lives of these policies in proportion to total gross profits. total table of contents gross profits include both actual gross profits and estimates of gross profits for future periods. gross profits are defined as: i) amounts assessed for mortality, contract administration, surrender charges, and other assessments plus amounts earned from investment of policyholder balances, less ii) benefits in excess of policyholder balances, costs incurred for contract administration, the net cost of reinsurance for certain businesses, interest credited to policyholder balances and other credits. if significant negative gross profits are expected in any periods, the amount of insurance in force is generally substituted as the base for computing amortization. u.s. gaap gross profits and amortization rates also include the impacts of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts, and index-linked crediting features of certain universal life and annuity contracts and related hedging activities. for additional information regarding the significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives including capital market assumptions and actuarially-determined assumptions, see below "-insurance liabilities-future policy benefits." in calculating amortization expense, we estimate the amounts of gross profits that will be included in our u.s. gaap results and in adjusted operating income, and utilize these estimates to calculate distinct amortization rates and expense amounts. we also regularly evaluate and adjust the related dac and dsi balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact of actual gross profits and changes in our projections of estimated future gross profits on our dac and dsi amortization rates. adjustments to the dac and dsi balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience, and our quarterly adjustments for market performance. each of these adjustments is further discussed below in "-annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments."
gross margins. dac associated with the traditional participating products of our closed block is amortized over the expected lives of these contracts in proportion to total gross margins. total gross margins are defined as: i) amounts received from premiums, earned from investment of policyholder balances and other assessments, less ii) benefits paid, costs for contract administration, changes in the net level premium reserve for death and endowment benefits, annual policyholder dividends and other credits. we evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins. dac adjustments for these participating products generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since many of the factors that affect gross margins are also included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders and, during most years, the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in "policyholders' dividends," for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization. however, if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense, changes in gross margins and dac amortization would result in a net impact to the closed block results of operations. as of december 31, 2022, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $3,207 million.
the amortization methodologies for products not discussed above primarily relate to less significant dac and dsi balances associated with products in our group insurance segment and the institutional portion within our retirement strategies segment, which comprised approximately 1% of the company's total dac and dsi balances as of december 31, 2022.
value of business acquired in addition to dac and dsi, we also recognize an asset for voba, which is an intangible asset that represents an adjustment to the stated value of acquired in-force insurance contract liabilities to present them at fair value, determined as of the acquisition date. voba is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize dac and dsi, as discussed above. voba is also subject to recoverability testing. as of december 31, 2022, voba was $595 million, and included $571 million related to the acquisition from american international group ("aig") of aig star life insurance co., ltd, aig edison life insurance company, aig financial assurance japan k.k. and aig edison service co., ltd. (collectively, the "star and edison businesses") in 2011. the remaining balance primarily relates to previously-acquired traditional life businesses. the voba associated with the in-force contracts of the star and edison businesses is less sensitive to assumption changes, as discussed below in "-annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments", as the majority is amortized in proportion to gross premiums which are more predictably stable compared to gross profits.
annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments we perform an annual comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods. over the last several years, the company's most significant assumption updates that have resulted in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of dac, dsi and voba have been related to lapse and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. these assumptions may also cause potential significant variability in amortization expense in the future. the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.
table of contents the quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. to the extent each period's actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. in these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods' amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.
the quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance and market conditions. a significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and, to a lesser degree, our variable life contracts are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. this rate of return influences the fees we earn on variable annuity and variable life contracts, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts and expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts, as well as other sources of profit. returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the future fees we expect to earn on variable annuity and variable life contracts and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts, as well as expected claims to be paid on variable life contracts. the opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. the changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods' amortization.
the weighted average rate of return assumptions used in developing estimated market returns consider many factors specific to each product type, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. with regard to equity market assumptions, the near-term future rate of return assumption used in evaluating dac, dsi and voba and liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, primarily our domestic variable annuity and domestic and international variable life insurance products is generally updated each quarter and is derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. under this approach, we consider historical equity returns and adjust projected equity returns over an initial future period of five years (the "near-term") so that equity returns converge to the long-term expected rate of return. if the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return of 15.0%, we use our maximum future rate of return. if the near-term projected future rate of return is lower than our near-term minimum future rate of return of 0%, we use our minimum future rate of return. as of december 31, 2022, our domestic variable annuities and variable life insurance businesses assume an 8.0% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 6.9% near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return, and our international variable life insurance business assumes a 4.8% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 3.1% near-term mean reversion equity expected rate of return.
with regard to interest rate assumptions used in evaluating dac, dsi and voba and liabilities for future policy benefits for certain of our products, we update the long-term and near-term future rates used to project fixed income returns annually and quarterly, respectively. as a result of our 2022 annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, we kept our long-term expectation of the 10-year u.s. treasury rate and 10-year japanese government bond yield unchanged and continue to grade to rates of 3.25% and 1.00%, respectively, over ten years. as part of our quarterly market experience updates, we update our near-term projections of interest rates to reflect changes in current rates.
insurance liabilities future policy benefits future policy benefit reserves, including unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses we establish reserves for future policy benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders using methodologies prescribed by u.s. gaap. the reserving methodologies used include the following:
•for most long-duration contracts, we utilize a net premium valuation methodology in measuring the liability for future policy benefits. under this methodology, a liability for future policy benefits is accrued when premium revenue is recognized. the liability, which represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and related expenses less the present value of future net premiums (portion of the gross premium required to provide for all benefits and expenses), is estimated using methods that include assumptions applicable at the time the insurance contracts are made with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. original assumptions continue to be used in subsequent accounting periods to determine changes in the liability for future policy benefits (often referred to as the "lock-in concept") unless a premium deficiency exists. the result of the net premium valuation methodology is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of premiums received to date expected to be needed to fund future benefits (i.e., net premiums received to date), less any benefits and expenses already paid. the liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the table of contents company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that obligation would be funded by net premiums received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. if the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., gaap reserves net of any dac, dsi or voba asset), the existing net reserves are first adjusted by reducing these assets by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. if the deficiency is more than these asset balances for insurance contracts, we then increase the net reserves by the excess, again through a charge to current period earnings. if a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the premium deficiency test date are locked-in and used in subsequent valuations and the net reserves continue to be subject to premium deficiency testing. in addition, for limited-payment contracts, future policy benefit reserves also include a deferred profit liability representing gross premiums received in excess of net premiums. the deferred profits are generally recognized in revenue in a constant relationship with insurance in force or with the amount of expected future benefit payments.
•for certain contract features, such as those related to guaranteed minimum death benefits ("gmdb"), guaranteed minimum income benefits ("gmib") and no-lapse guarantees, a liability is established when associated assessments (which include policy charges for administration, mortality, expense, surrender, and other, regardless of how characterized) are recognized. this liability is established using current best estimate assumptions and is based on the ratio of the present value of total expected excess payments (e.g., payments in excess of account value) over the life of the contract divided by the present value of total expected assessments (i.e., benefit ratio). the liability equals the current benefit ratio multiplied by cumulative assessments recognized to date, plus interest, less cumulative excess payments to date. the result of the benefit ratio method is that the liability at any point in time represents an accumulation of the portion of assessments received to date expected to be needed to fund future excess payments, less any excess payments already paid. the liability does not necessarily reflect the full policyholder obligation the company expects to pay at the conclusion of the contract since a portion of that excess payment would be funded by assessments received in the future and would be recognized in the liability at that time. similar to as described above for dac, the reserves are subject to adjustments based on annual reviews of assumptions and quarterly adjustments for experience, including market performance. these adjustments reflect the impact on the benefit ratio of using actual historical experience from the issuance date to the balance sheet date plus updated estimates of future experience. the updated benefit ratio is then applied to all prior periods' assessments to derive an adjustment to the reserve recognized through a benefit or charge to current period earnings.
•for certain product guarantees, primarily certain optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products in the individual portion of our retirement strategies segment including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ("gmab"), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ("gmwb") and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits ("gmiwb"), the benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives using a fair value accounting framework. the fair value of these contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future benefit payments to contractholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. under u.s. gaap, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in valuing these embedded derivatives. changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are recorded quarterly through a benefit or charge to current period earnings. for additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
•in certain instances, the policyholder liability for a particular line of business may not be deficient in the aggregate to trigger loss recognition, but the pattern of earnings may be such that profits are expected to be recognized in earlier years followed by losses in later years. in these situations, accounting standards require that an additional liability (profits followed by losses or "pfl" liability) be recognized by an amount necessary to sufficiently offset the losses that would be recognized in later years. the pfl liability is based on our current estimate of the present value of the amount necessary to offset losses anticipated in future periods. because the liability is measured on a discounted basis, there will also be accretion into future earnings through an interest charge, and the liability will ultimately be released into earnings as an offset to future losses. historically, the company's pfl liabilities have been predominantly associated with certain universal life contracts that measure net gaap reserves using current best estimate assumptions and accordingly, have been updated each quarter using current in-force and market data and as part of the annual assumption update. at the target accrual date (i.e., date of peak deficiency), the pfl liability transitions to a premium deficiency reserve and, for universal life products, will continue to be updated each quarter using current in-force and market data and as part of the annual assumption update.
the assumptions used in establishing reserves are generally based on the company's experience, industry experience and/or other factors, as applicable. we update our actuarial assumptions, such as mortality, morbidity, retirement and policyholder behavior assumptions, annually, unless a material change is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long-term trend. generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term.
table of contents the following paragraphs provide additional details about the reserves we have established:
international businesses. the reserves for future policy benefits of our international businesses, which as of december 31, 2022, represented 43% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to non-participating whole life and term life products and endowment contracts, and are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. the primary assumptions used in determining expected future benefits and expenses include mortality, lapse, morbidity, investment yield and maintenance expense assumptions. reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported. in addition, future policy benefit reserves for certain contracts also include amounts related to our deferred profit liability, as described above.
retirement strategies. the reserves for future policy benefits of our institutional retirement strategies business, which as of december 31, 2022, represented 27% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to our non-participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products and are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves include mortality, retirement, maintenance expense and investment yield assumptions. in addition, future policy benefit reserves for certain contracts also include amounts related to our deferred profit liability, as described above.
the reserves for future policy benefits of our individual retirement strategies business, which as of december 31, 2022, represented 2% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to reserves for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuities, and for the optional living benefit features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. as discussed above, in establishing reserves for gmdbs and gmibs, we utilize current best estimate assumptions. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include annuitization, lapse, withdrawal and mortality assumptions, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on the in-the-moneyness of the benefit and reflect other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. lapse rates are reduced when contracts are more in-the-money. lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply. for life contingent payout annuity contracts, we establish reserves using best estimate assumptions with provisions for adverse deviations as of inception or best estimate assumptions as of the most recent loss recognition date.
the reserves for certain optional living benefit features, including gmab, gmwb and gmiwb are accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value, as described above. this methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various actuarial assumptions. since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. the models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. the significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives include capital market assumptions, such as interest rate levels and volatility assumptions, the company's market-perceived risk of its own non-performance risk ("npr"), as well as actuarially-determined assumptions, including mortality rates and contractholder behavior, such as lapse rates, benefit utilization rates and withdrawal rates. capital market inputs and actual contractholders' account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the end of the quarter, including interest rates, equity markets and volatility. in the risk neutral valuation, the initial swap curve drives the total returns used to grow the contractholders' account values. through the first quarter of 2022, the company's discount rate assumption was based on the london inter-bank offered rate ("libor") swap curve adjusted for an additional spread, which included an estimate of npr. as of the second quarter of 2022, the company's discount rate assumption substituted the secured overnight financial rate ("sofr") for libor as part of the annual assumption update. the discount rate assumption continues to use an additional spread which includes an estimate of npr. actuarial assumptions, including contractholder behavior and mortality, are reviewed at least annually, and updated based upon emerging experience, future expectations and other data, including any observable market data, such as available industry studies or market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. for additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
individual life. the reserves for future policy benefits of our individual life segment, which as of december 31, 2022, represented 7% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to term life, universal life and variable life products. for term life contracts, the future policy benefit reserves are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. the primary assumptions used in determining expected future benefits and expenses include mortality, lapse, investment yield and maintenance expense assumptions. for variable and universal life products, which include universal life contracts that contain no-lapse guarantees, reserves for future policy benefits are primarily established using the reserving methodology for gmdb and gmib contracts, which utilizes current best estimate assumptions, as discussed above. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves generally include mortality, lapse, and premium pattern, as well as interest rate and equity market return assumptions. reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported.
table of contents group insurance. the reserves for future policy benefits of our group insurance segment, which as of december 31, 2022, represented 2% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to reserves for group life and disability benefits. for short-duration contracts, a liability is established when the claim is incurred. the reserves for group life and disability benefits also include a liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, which relates primarily to the group long-term disability product. this liability represents our estimate of the present value of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred, but have not yet been reported, as of the balance sheet date. the primary assumptions used in determining expected future claim payments are claim termination factors, an assumed interest rate and expected social security offsets. the remaining reserves for future policy benefits for group life and disability benefits relate primarily to our group life business, and include reserves for waiver of premium, claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported. the waiver of premium reserve is calculated as the present value of future benefits and utilizes assumptions such as expected mortality and recovery rates. the reserve for claims reported but not yet paid is based on the inventory of claims that have been reported but not yet paid. the reserve for claims incurred but not yet reported is estimated using expected patterns of claims reporting.
corporate and other. the reserves for future policy benefits of our corporate & other operations, which as of december 31, 2022, represented 3% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to our long-term care products and are generally calculated using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. due to the recognition of a premium deficiency in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the decline in interest rates, the active life reserves associated with our long-term care contracts are valued with the best estimate assumptions at that time. the primary assumptions used in establishing these reserves include interest rate, morbidity, mortality, lapse, premium rate increase and maintenance expense assumptions. in addition, certain reserves for our long-term care products, including our disabled life reserves, are established each reporting period using current best estimate assumptions.
closed block division. the future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of the closed block division, which as of december 31, 2022, represented 16% of our total future policy benefit reserves are determined using the net premium valuation methodology, as described above. in applying this method, we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums, and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both of these amounts. the mortality assumptions are based on standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies, and the interest rates used are the interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policies.
policyholders' account balances the policyholders' account balances liability represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. this liability is primarily associated with the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance, as applicable. our unearned revenue reserve also reported as a component of "policyholders' account balances" primarily relates to the variable and universal life products within our individual life and international businesses segments and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. the charges are deferred as unearned revenue and are generally amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product's estimated gross profits, similar to dac, dsi and voba as discussed above. policyholders' account balances also include amounts representing the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the index-linked features of certain universal life and annuity products. for additional information regarding the valuation of these embedded derivatives, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
sensitivities for insurance assets and liabilities the following table summarizes the aggregate impact that could result on each of the listed financial statement balances from changes in certain key assumptions. the figures below are presented in aggregate for the company. the information below is for illustrative purposes and includes only the hypothetical direct impact on december 31, 2022 balances of changes in a single assumption and not changes in any combination of assumptions. additionally, the illustration of the insurance assumption impacts below reflects a parallel shift in the insurance assumptions across the company; however, these may be non-parallel in practice and only applicable to specific businesses. changes in current assumptions could result in impacts to financial statement balances that are in excess of the amounts illustrated. a description of the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of each of these financial statement balances is provided above. for traditional long-duration and limited-payment contracts, u.s. gaap requires the original assumptions used when the contracts are issued to be locked-in and that those assumptions be used in all future liability calculations as long as the resulting liabilities are adequate to provide for the future benefits and expenses (i.e., there is no premium deficiency). therefore, these products are not reflected in the sensitivity table below unless the hypothetical change in assumption would result in an adverse impact that would cause a premium deficiency. similarly, the impact of any favorable hypothetical change in assumptions for traditional long-duration and limited-
table of contents payment contracts is not reflected in the table below given that the current assumption is required to remain locked-in, and instead the positive impacts would be recognized into net income over the life of the policies in force.
the impacts presented within this table exclude the following:
•the impacts of our asset liability management strategy, which seeks to offset the changes in certain of the balances presented within this table and is primarily composed of investments and derivatives. see further below for a discussion of the estimates and assumptions involved with the application of u.s. gaap accounting policies for these instruments and "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for hypothetical impacts on related balances as a result of changes in certain significant assumptions.
•the impacts of our long-term care business, a component of our divested and run-off businesses within our corporate and other operations. long-term care business sensitivities are presented separately from the immediately following table in order to provide stand-alone and supplementary information (see "-sensitivities for the long-term care business within corporate and other").

sensitivities for the long-term care business within corporate and other the following table summarizes certain significant assumptions made in establishing best estimate reserves for long-term care products to perform premium deficiency testing, and the net impact that could result to the best estimate reserves from changes in these assumptions should they occur. under u.s. gaap, reserves for long-term care products are primarily calculated using the locked-in assumptions concept described above. as such, the adverse hypothetical impacts illustrated in the table below are those that would increase our best estimate reserves and, when compared to our gaap reserves, may cause a premium deficiency that would require us to unlock and update our assumptions and record a charge to net income. the favorable hypothetical impacts in the table below would decrease our best estimate reserves but would not result in an immediate decrease to our gaap reserves (given that we would be required to leave the current assumptions locked-in); rather, the positive impacts would be recognized into net income over the life of the policies in force.
table of contents the information below is for illustrative purposes and includes the impacts of changes in a single assumption and not changes in any combination of assumptions. as a result of emerging experience, changes in current assumptions may result in impacts to the best estimate reserve in future periods that are in excess of or lower than the amounts illustrated.

other accounting policies goodwill as of december 31, 2022, our goodwill balance of $876 million is primarily reflected in the following reporting units: $549 million for pgim, $177 million for assurance iq and $115 million for gibraltar life and other. the company recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $903 million and $1,060 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, both related to the assurance iq reporting unit. there was no goodwill impairment in 2020.
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december 31 and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the potential for impairment is more likely than not. the goodwill impairment analysis is performed at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, our operating segments. although the accounting guidance provides for an optional qualitative assessment for testing goodwill impairment, the company performed the quantitative test for all reporting units and compared each reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value as of december 31, 2022. the carrying value represents the capital that the business would require if operating as a standalone entity.
the annual quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for assurance iq utilized both an income approach based on discounted cash flow valuation techniques and a market approach based on forward sales multiples. the estimated fair value of assurance iq as of december 31, 2022 was based on weighting the results of each approach and included assumptions that a market participant would use to value the business. based on the goodwill impairment test performed as of december 31, 2022, the company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment pre-tax charge of $903 million ($713 million after-tax) for assurance iq primarily driven by a reduction in the forecasted cash flows and higher discount rates as part of the income approach and, to a lesser extent, by decreases in the valuations of comparable companies as part of the market approach, as described further below.
the income approach estimated the fair value of assurance iq by applying a discount rate, derived from a capital asset pricing model and reflecting a market expected rate of return for the reporting unit, to its projected future cash flows. the projected future cash flows involved significant judgement and were based on our internal forecasts including expected synergies, and a range of terminal values, which incorporated an expected long-term growth rate and sales and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") market-based multiples. revisions to the long-term forecasts, as part of the strategic review of the business in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflected lower growth rates across all product lines table of contents driven by challenges in scaling and extended expected timing of reaching sustained profitability. these revisions, combined with changes in, and challenges from, the current and expected industry and market conditions and trends, a higher applied discount rate, and lower expected synergies, led to declines in the present value of the projected cash flows and the estimated fair value of assurance under the income approach, consistent with how a market participant would assess the value of the business as of december 31, 2022.
the market approach derived the fair value of assurance iq based on comparable publicly traded companies by utilizing forward market multiples based on independent analysts' consensus estimates for each company's forecasted sales. the sales multiple was applied to assurance iq's forecasted results, and an implied control premium, reflective of expected synergies a market participant would realize, was added to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as of december 31, 2022. the market approach also resulted in a decline in the estimated fair value of assurance iq as of december 31, 2022 as the value of the comparable publicly traded companies declined during 2022, resulting in a lower multiple being applied to the forecasted revenues of the business. the fair value of the reporting unit was also negatively impacted by reductions in the forecasted revenue growth levels and a lower implied control premium reflective of a decline in the expected synergies that could be realized.
the $903 million pre-tax impairment charge resulted in $177 million goodwill asset assigned to the assurance iq reporting unit as of december 31, 2022. the decreased carrying value of the goodwill asset as of december 31, 2022 makes it less sensitive to potential future changes in the inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of assurance iq.
both gibraltar life and other and pgim completed a quantitative impairment analysis using an earnings multiple approach, which resulted in their fair values exceeding their carrying values by a weighted average of 264% as of december 31, 2022.
estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of significant estimates by management. while changes in individual factors or events impact the valuation of our reporting units, it is the magnitude of the change of all valuation inputs, considered in totality, that will ultimately determine the impact to the fair value of our businesses holding goodwill. for all reporting units tested, unanticipated changes in business performance or the regulatory environment, market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, including changes in market multiples, discount rates, and growth rate assumptions or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses, could cause additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods. for additional information regarding goodwill and our reporting segments, see note 2 and note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
valuation of investments, including derivatives, measurement of allowance for credit losses, and the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets, and derivative financial instruments. derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities or commodities. derivative financial instruments that are generally used include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter ("otc") market. we are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are "embedded" in the financial instruments. management believes the following accounting policies related to investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to investments and derivatives, as referenced below:
•valuation of investments, including derivatives;
•measurement of the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity, commercial mortgage loans, and other loans; and
•recognition of other-than-temporary impairments ("otti") for equity method investments and wholly-owned investment real estate.
we present at fair value in the statements of financial position our debt security investments classified as available-for-sale, investments classified as trading such as our assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and certain fixed maturities, equity securities, and certain investments within "other invested assets," such as derivatives. for additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements and "-valuation of assets and liabilities-fair value of assets and liabilities."
table of contents for our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in aoci, a separate component of equity. for our investments classified as trading and equity securities, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within "other income (loss)." our investments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at the acquisition price, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts, and a valuation allowance for losses. our commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses.
in addition, an allowance for credit losses is measured each quarter for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans. for additional information regarding our policies regarding the measurement of credit losses, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
for equity method investments and wholly-owned investment real estate, the carrying value of these investments is written down or impaired to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary.
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements. our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount (interest) rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets, expected increases in compensation levels, mortality and trends in health care costs. of these assumptions, our expected rate of return assumptions and our discount rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans.
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers plan asset mix, risk free rates, inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses, the effect of active management and the effect of rebalancing for the equity, debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. our assumed long-term rate of return for 2022 was 6.00% for our domestic pension plans and 7.00% for our other postretirement benefit plans. given the amount of plan assets as of december 31, 2021, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our domestic pension and other domestic postretirement benefit plans that was 100 bps higher or 100 bps lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.
for the year ended december 31, 2022
foreign pension plans represent 4% of plan assets at the beginning of 2022. an increase in expected rate of return by 100 bps would result in a decrease in net periodic pension costs of $5 million; conversely, a decrease in expected rate of return by 100 bps would result in an increase in net periodic pension costs of $4 million.
we determine our discount rate, used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the december 31, 2021 methodology we employed to determine our discount rate for 2022. our assumed discount rate for 2022 was 2.85% for our domestic pension plans and 2.75% for our other domestic postretirement benefit plans. given the amount of pension and postretirement obligations as of december 31, 2021, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our domestic pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 bps higher or 100 bps lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed discount rate without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate.
table of contents for the year ended december 31, 2022
foreign pension plans represent 12% of plan obligations at the beginning of 2022. an increase in discount rate by 100 bps would result in a decrease in net periodic pension costs of $7 million; conversely, a decrease in discount rate by 100 bps would result in an increase in net periodic pension costs of $9 million.
given the application of the authoritative guidance for accounting for pensions, and the deferral and amortization of actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in our assumed discount rate, the change in net periodic pension cost arising from an increase in the assumed discount rate by 100 bps would not always be expected to equal the change in net periodic pension cost arising from a decrease in the assumed discount rate by 100 bps.
for a discussion of our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate for our qualified pension plan in 2022, see "-results of operations by segment-corporate and other."
for purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended december 31, 2023, we increased the discount rate to 5.45% from 2.85% in 2022. the expected rate of return on plan assets increased to 7.50% in 2023 from 6.00% in 2022, and the assumed rate of increase in compensation remained unchanged at 4.50%.
in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, or changes in benefits provided under the plans.
at december 31, 2022, the sensitivity of our domestic and foreign pension and postretirement obligations to a 100 basis point change in discount rate was as follows.
increase/(decrease) in                          increase/(decrease) in pension benefits obligation                     accumulated postretirement benefits obligation
taxes on income our effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, tax credits, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. the dividend received deduction ("drd") is a major reason for the difference between the company's effective tax rate and the u.s. federal statutory rate. the drd is an estimate that incorporates the prior and current year information, as well as the current year's equity market performance. both the current estimate of the drd and the drd in future periods can vary based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the drd, changes in the amount of distributions received from underlying fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the company's taxable income before the drd.
an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in a decrease or increase in our 2022 "total income tax expense (benefit)" of $18 million.
the cares act. on march 27, 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (the "cares act") was enacted into law. one provision of the cares act amends the tax act of 2017 and allows companies with net operating losses ("nols") originating in 2018, 2019, or 2020 to carry back those losses up to five years. for 2020, the company recorded an income tax benefit of $51 million and $149 million from carrying the 2018 and 2020 nols back to tax years that have a 35% tax rate.
table of contents contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. under u.s. gaap, accruals for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated, such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter. the initial reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.
commission revenue for digital insurance brokerage placement services, the company earns both initial and renewal commissions as compensation for the placement of insurance policies with insurance carriers. at the effective date of the policy, the company records within "other income" the expected lifetime revenue for the initial and renewal commissions considering estimates of the timing of future policy cancellations. these estimates are reassessed each reporting period and any changes in estimates are reflected in the current period.
adoption of new accounting pronouncements asu 2018-12, financial services-insurance (topic 944): targeted improvements to the accounting for long-duration contracts, was issued by the fasb on august 15, 2018, and was amended by asu 2019-09, financial services - insurance (topic 944): effective date, issued in october 2019, and asu 2020-11, financial services-insurance (topic 944): effective date and early application, issued in november 2020. the company will adopt asu 2018-12 effective january 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective transition method where permitted, and apply the guidance as of january 1, 2021 (and record transition adjustments as of january 1, 2021) in the 2023 financial statements.
the company has an established governance framework to manage the implementation of the standard. the company has substantially completed its implementation efforts including, but not limited to, implementing refinements to key accounting policy decisions, modifications to actuarial valuation models, updates to data sourcing capabilities, automation of key financial reporting and analytical processes and updates to internal control over financial reporting and disclosure.
asu 2018-12 will impact, at least to some extent, the accounting and disclosure requirements for all long-duration insurance and investment contracts issued by the company. the company expects the standard to have a significant financial impact on its consolidated financial statements and will significantly increase disclosures. as of the january 1, 2021 transition date, the company estimates that the implementation of the standard will result in a decrease to "retained earnings" of approximately $3 billion primarily from reclassifying the cumulative effect of changes in non-performance risk on market risk benefits from "retained earnings" to "accumulated other comprehensive income" ("aoci") and other changes in reserves, and will result in a decrease to aoci of approximately $42 billion primarily from remeasuring in-force non-participating traditional and limited-pay insurance contract liabilities using upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yields as of the transition date. as of december 31, 2021, the estimated impacts amounted to a decrease to "retained earnings" of approximately $2 billion and a decrease to aoci of approximately $31 billion. as of september 30, 2022, the estimated impacts amounted to a decrease to "retained earnings" of approximately $2 billion and an increase to aoci of approximately $17 billion. the changes in the estimates impacting aoci from january 1, 2021 to september 30, 2022 are primarily due to the increases in interest rates during 2021 and 2022. in addition to the impacts to the balance sheet, the company also expects an impact to the pattern of earnings emergence following the transition date.

(3)includes certain components of consideration for business acquisitions, which are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods.
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. adjusted operating income decreased $800 million, reflecting a decrease in service, distribution and other revenues, driven by the absence of a gain in the prior year period from the sale of our pramerica sgr joint venture, and lower other related revenues and asset management fees, net of related expenses.

(2)includes mortgage origination revenues from our commercial mortgage origination and servicing business.
(3)results for the year ended december 31, 2021 include a $378 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of our 35% ownership stake in pramerica sgr, an asset management joint venture in italy.
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. revenues decreased $871 million. service, distribution and other revenues decreased, primarily reflecting the absence of a gain in the prior year period from the sale of our pramerica sgr joint venture, and lower revenues from certain consolidated funds (which were fully offset by lower variable expenses related to noncontrolling interests in these funds). asset management fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in average assets under management, driven by market depreciation reflecting higher interest rates and widening credit spreads, as well as unfavorable equity markets. also contributing to the decrease were lower other related revenues primarily driven by lower performance-based incentive fees, reflecting investment underperformance, lower commercial mortgage origination revenues driven by higher interest rates and general economic uncertainty, and lower seed and co-investments results.
expenses decreased $71 million, primarily reflecting lower variable expenses associated with a decrease in overall segment earnings and lower revenues from certain consolidated funds, as discussed above. the decrease was partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily driven by an increase in travel and entertainment costs, and an increase in compensation expenses.

(1)"public equity" represents stock ownership interest in a corporation or partnership (excluding hedge funds) or real estate investment trust. "public fixed income" represents debt instruments that pay interest and usually have a maturity (excluding mortgages). "real estate" includes direct real estate equity and real estate mortgages. "private credit and other alternatives" includes private credit, private equity, hedge funds and other alternative strategies. "multi-asset" includes funds or products that invest in more than one asset class, balancing equity and fixed income funds and target date funds.
(2)primarily includes assets related to certain annuity, variable life, retirement and group life products in our u.s. businesses and corporate & other operations, and certain general account assets in our international businesses. these assets are not directly managed by pgim, but rather are invested in non-proprietary funds or are managed by either the divisions themselves or by our chief investment officer organization.
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. pgim's assets under management decreased $295 billion in 2022, primarily driven by market depreciation resulting from higher interest rates and widening credit spreads, as well as unfavorable equity markets. the decrease also reflects a reduction in assets under management from the sales of the full service retirement business and palac in the second quarter of 2022, public fixed income and public equity net outflows, and unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts.

private capital deployment private capital deployment is indicative of the pace and magnitude of capital that is invested and will result in future revenues that may include management fees, transaction fees, incentive fees and servicing revenues, as well as future costs to manage these assets.
private capital deployment represents the gross value of private capital invested in real estate debt and equity, and private credit and equity asset classes. assets under management resulting from private capital deployment are included in "real estate" and "private credit and other alternatives" in the "-assets under management-by asset class table" above. as of december 31, 2022, these assets decreased approximately $7.7 billion compared to december 31, 2021, primarily reflecting market depreciation.
private capital deployment includes pgim's real estate agency debt business, which consists of agency commercial loans that are originated and sold to third-party investors. pgim continues to service these commercial loans; however, they are not included in assets under management.

2022 to 2021 annual comparison. adjusted operating income for our u.s. businesses decreased by $996 million primarily due to:
•an unfavorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, primarily reflecting a net charge from these updates in the second quarter of 2022 in our individual life business, mainly driven by unfavorable impacts related to assumptions for policyholder behavior and mortality;
•lower net investment spread results driven by lower income on non-coupon investments, partially offset by higher reinvestment rates and business growth; and
•lower fee income, net of distribution expenses and other associated costs, primarily in our individual retirement strategies business due to a reduction in account values as a result of the sale of palac and unfavorable equity markets.
•partially offsetting these decreases were a gain in our individual retirement strategies business from the sale of palac in the second quarter of 2022; and
•higher underwriting results, including lower covid-19 related mortality claims, in our group insurance and individual life businesses, as well as more favorable disability results in our group insurance business.
retirement strategies in october 2021, the company announced the creation of retirement strategies, a new u.s. business that would serve the retirement needs of both our institutional and individual customers by bringing the institutional investment and pension solutions offered through our retirement business together with the financial solutions and capabilities of our individual annuities business. commencing with the second quarter of 2022, this new structure has been fully operationalized; therefore, the results of our former retirement segment (now known as the "institutional retirement strategies" operating segment) and our former individual annuities segment (now known as the "individual retirement strategies" operating segment) have been aggregated into the retirement strategies segment. prior periods have been updated to conform to this new presentation.
business updates
•in april 2022, the company completed the sale of its full service retirement business to great-west life & annuity insurance company ("great-west"). the transaction involved the sale of legal entities, reinsurance, and the transfer of contracts and brokerage accounts to great-west. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
beginning in the third quarter of 2021, the company reported the assets and liabilities of the full service retirement business as "held-for-sale" and transferred the results of this business to divested and run-off businesses within corporate and other operations. as such, the following results for the institutional retirement strategies operating segment are now solely reflective of the company's institutional investment products business.
•in april 2022, the company completed the sale of palac, which represented a portion of its in-force traditional variable annuity block of business, to fortitude group holdings, llc, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $852 million. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
beginning in the third quarter of 2021, the company reported the assets and liabilities of this block of business as "held-for-sale" with the results continuing to be reported within the former individual annuities segment's operating results until the sale was completed.

2022 to 2021 annual comparison. adjusted operating income from our institutional retirement strategies business decreased $637 million, including a favorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2022 had no net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions, while results for 2021 included a $14 million net charge. excluding this item, adjusted operating income decreased $651 million, driven by lower net investment spread results, primarily reflecting lower income on non-coupon investments, partially offset by higher reinvestment rates and business growth.
adjusted operating income from our individual retirement strategies business increased $781 million, including a favorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, which resulted in a $25 million net benefit in 2022 compared to a $15 million charge in 2021. excluding this item, adjusted operating income increased $741 million primarily driven by the gain on sale of palac. also contributing to the increase were higher net investment spread results, driven by growth in indexed variable annuities and more favorable interest rates, as well as lower expenses and market value gains on a strategic investment. these increases were partially offset by lower fee income, net of distribution expenses and other associated costs, resulting from lower separate account values due to the impact of the sale of palac, net outflows and unfavorable equity markets.
our individual retirement strategies business includes both fixed and variable annuities which may include optional guaranteed living benefit riders (e.g., gmib, gmab, gmwb and gmiwb), and/or optional death benefit riders (e.g., gmdb). we also offer fixed annuities that provide a guarantee of principal and interest credited at rates we determine (subject to certain contractual minimums) or at rates based upon the performance of an index (subject to caps or participation rates), as well as indexed variable annuities that provide several index crediting strategies and varying levels of downside protection at predetermined levels and durations. the drivers of our business results are generally included in adjusted operating income, with exceptions related to certain guarantees, as discussed below.
the u.s. gaap accounting and our adjusted operating income treatment for our guarantees differ depending upon the specific contractual features. under u.s. gaap, the reserves for gmib and gmdb are accounted for in accordance with an insurance fulfillment accounting framework and the results are included in adjusted operating income in a manner generally consistent with u.s. gaap.
table of contents in contrast, certain of our guaranteed living benefit riders (e.g., gmab, gmwb and gmiwb) are accounted for under u.s. gaap as embedded derivatives and reported using a fair value accounting framework. for purposes of measuring segment performance, adjusted operating income excludes the changes in fair value and instead reflects the performance of these riders using an insurance fulfillment accounting framework. under this framework, adjusted operating income recognized each period reflects the rider fees earned during the period, less the portion of such fees estimated to be required to cover future benefit payments and hedging costs. sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders were discontinued as of december 31, 2020, and, in april 2022, the sale of a portion of our in-force traditional variable annuity block was completed, as discussed above.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. revenues from our institutional retirement strategies business increased $4,143 million. this increase primarily reflected higher pension risk transfer premiums due to new sales in the current year, with corresponding offsets in policyholders' benefits, as discussed below, partially offset by lower net investment income and other income, primarily reflecting lower income on non-coupon investments.
benefits and expenses of our institutional retirement strategies business increased $4,780 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $4,794 million. policyholders' benefits, including the change in policy reserves, increased primarily related to the higher pension risk transfer premiums discussed above.
revenues from our individual retirement strategies business increased $398 million. the increase was primarily driven by the gain on sale of palac and market value gains on a strategic investment, partially offset by lower policy charges and fee income, reflecting lower average separate account values due to the impact of the sale of palac, as discussed below, net outflows and unfavorable equity markets.
benefits and expenses of our individual retirement strategies business decreased $383 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses decreased $343 million primarily driven by lower general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, driven by lower distribution and asset management expenses reflecting lower average separate account values, as discussed above, as well as lower operating and other expenses.
account values institutional retirement strategies. account values are a significant driver of our operating results and are primarily driven by net additions (withdrawals) and the impact of market changes. the investment income and interest we credit to policyholders on our spread-based products varies with the level of general account values. the income we earn on most of our fee-based products varies with the level of fee-based account values as many policy fees are determined by these values.
the following table shows the changes in the account values of institutional retirement strategies' products for the periods indicated. account values include both internally- and externally-managed client balances as the total balances drive revenue for the institutional retirement strategies business. for additional information regarding internally-managed balances, see "-pgim."

(1)additions primarily include: group annuities and funded pension reinsurance calculated based on premiums received; international longevity reinsurance contracts calculated as the present value of future projected benefits; investment-only stable value contracts calculated as the fair value of customers' funds held in a client-owned trust; and funding agreements issued calculated based on premiums received.
(2)"other" activity includes the effect of foreign exchange rate changes associated with our british pounds sterling denominated international reinsurance business and changes in asset balances for externally-managed accounts. for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, "other" activity also includes $3,800 million in receipts offset by $3,516 million in payments and $3,079 million in receipts offset by $3,224 million in payments, respectively, related to funding agreements backed by commercial paper which typically have maturities of less than 90 days.
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. the increase in institutional retirement strategies account values reflects net additions primarily driven by significant pension risk transfer transactions, including funded pension risk transfer and international reinsurance sales, and interest credited on customer funds, partially offset by the decline in the market value of account assets and the negative impact of foreign exchange rate changes.
individual retirement strategies. account values are a significant driver of our operating results. since most fees are determined by the level of separate account assets, fee income varies primarily based on the level of account values. additionally, our fee income generally drives other items such as the pattern of amortization of dac and other costs. account values are driven by net flows from new business sales, surrenders, withdrawals and benefit payments, policy charges and the impact of positive or negative market value changes. the annuity industry's competitive and regulatory landscapes may impact our net flows, including new business sales. the following table sets forth account value information for the periods indicated:

(1)includes gross variable and fixed annuities sold as retail investment products. variable annuity account values were $113.9 billion, $176.4 billion and $170.5 billion as of december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. fixed annuity account values were $6.1 billion, $5.9 billion and $5.7 billion as of december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(2)results for the year ended december 31, 2022 reflect the reduction in account values resulting from the sale of palac, as discussed above.
(3)ending total account values for the year ended december 31, 2021 include approximately $30 billion of account values that were classified as "held-for-sale" as of december 31, 2021 in relation to the palac sale, as discussed above.
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. the decrease in account values during 2022 was primarily driven by the impact of the sale of palac and market value depreciation.
the increase in sales, net of full surrenders and death benefits, reflects general uncertainty and volatility in financial markets in the current year that led to lower full surrenders by policyholders, partially offset by lower sales.
risks and risk mitigants the following is a summary of certain risks associated with individual retirement strategies' products, certain strategies in mitigating those risks including any updates to those strategies since the previous year-end, and the related financial results.
fixed annuity risks and risk mitigants. the primary risk exposure of our fixed annuity products relates to investment risks we bear for providing customers a minimum guaranteed interest rate or an index-linked interest rate required to be credited to the customer's account value, which include interest rate fluctuations and/or sustained periods of low interest rates, and credit risk related to the underlying investments. we manage these risk exposures primarily through our investment strategies and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to the minimum guaranteed interest rate as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. in addition, a portion of our fixed products has a market value adjustment provision that affords protection of lapse in the case of rising interest rates. we also manage these risk exposures through external reinsurance for certain of our fixed annuity products. for additional information regarding our external reinsurance agreements, see "business-retirement strategies" and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents indexed variable annuity risks and risk mitigants. the primary risk exposure of our indexed variable annuity products relates to the investment risks we bear in order to credit to the customer's account balance the required crediting rate based on the performance of the elected indices at the end of each term. we manage this risk primarily through our investment strategies and product design features, which include credit rate resetting subject to contractual minimums as well as surrender charges applied during the early years of the contract that help to provide protection for premature withdrawals. in addition, our indexed variable annuity strategies have an interim value provision that provides some protection from lapse in the case of rising interest rates.
variable annuity risks and risk mitigants. the primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, along with actuarial assumptions such as contractholder mortality, the timing and amount of annuitization and withdrawals, and contract lapses. for these risk exposures, achievement of our expected returns is subject to the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. we manage our exposure to certain risks driven by fluctuations in capital markets primarily through a combination of i) product design features, ii) our asset liability management strategy, and iii) our capital hedge program, as discussed below. we also manage these risk exposures through external reinsurance for certain of our variable annuity products. for additional information regarding our external reinsurance agreements, see "business-retirement strategies" and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. sales of traditional variable annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders were discontinued as of december 31, 2020, and, in april 2022, the sale of a portion of our in-force traditional variable annuity block was completed, as discussed above.
a portion of the variable annuity contracts that we offered include an automatic rebalancing feature, also referred to as an asset transfer feature. this feature is implemented at the contract level, and transfers assets between certain variable investment sub-accounts selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond fund sub-account within the separate accounts. the objective of the automatic rebalancing feature is to reduce our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. other product design features we utilize include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements and certain limitations on the amount of purchase payments, as well as a required minimum allocation to our general account for certain of our products. in addition, there is diversity in our fee arrangements, as certain fees are primarily based on the benefit guarantee amount, the contractholder account value and/or premiums, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline.
ii.asset liability management ("alm") strategy (including fixed income instruments and derivatives):
we employ an alm strategy that utilizes a combination of both traditional fixed income instruments and derivatives to meet expected liabilities associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees. the economic liability we manage with this alm strategy consists of expected living benefit claims under less severe market conditions, which are managed using fixed income instruments, derivatives, or a combination thereof, and potential living benefit claims resulting from more severe market conditions, which are hedged using derivative instruments. for our prudential defined income ("pdi") variable annuity, we utilize fixed income instruments to meet expected liabilities. for the portion of our alm strategy executed with derivatives, we enter into a range of exchange-traded and otc equity, interest rate and credit derivatives, including, but not limited to: equity and treasury futures; total return, credit default and interest rate swaps; and options including equity options, swaptions, and floors and caps. the intent of this strategy is to more efficiently manage the capital and liquidity associated with these products while continuing to mitigate fluctuations in net income due to movements in capital markets. to achieve this, we periodically review and recalibrate the alm strategy by optimizing the mix of derivatives and fixed income instruments to achieve expected outcomes.
the valuation of the economic liability we seek to defray excludes certain items that are included within the u.s. gaap liability, such as npr in order to maximize protection irrespective of the possibility of our own default, as well as risk margins (required by u.s. gaap but different from our best estimate) and valuation methodology differences. the following table provides a reconciliation between the liability reported under u.s. gaap and the economic liability we manage through our alm strategy as of the periods indicated:
u.s. gaap liability, including npr, net of reinsurance recoverables                 $4,753                     $13,028
adjustments including risk margins and valuation methodology differences           (2,499)                     (3,444)
economic liability managed through the alm strategy                                 $5,667                     $12,416
(1)includes the portion of the traditional variable annuities block of business that was classified as "held-for-sale" as of december 31, 2021 in relation to the palac sale, as discussed above.
as of december 31, 2022, the fair value of our fixed income instruments and derivative assets exceed the economic liability within the entities in which the risks reside.
under our alm strategy, we expect differences in the u.s. gaap net income impact between the changes in value of the fixed income instruments (either designated as available-for-sale or designated as trading) and derivatives as compared to the changes in the embedded derivative liability these assets support. these differences can be primarily attributed to three distinct areas:
•different valuation methodologies in measuring the liability we intend to cover with fixed income instruments and derivatives versus the liability reported under u.s. gaap. the valuation methodology utilized in estimating the economic liability we intend to defray with fixed income instruments and derivatives is different from that required to be utilized to measure the liability under u.s. gaap. additionally, the valuation of the economic liability excludes certain items that are included within the u.s. gaap liability, such as npr in order to maximize protection irrespective of the possibility of our own default and risk margins (required by u.s. gaap but different from our best estimate).
•different accounting treatment between liabilities and assets supporting those liabilities. under u.s. gaap, changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability, derivative instruments and fixed income instruments designated as trading are immediately reflected in net income, while changes in the fair value of fixed income instruments that are designated as available-for-sale are recorded as unrealized gains (losses) in other comprehensive income.
•general hedge results. for the derivative portion of the alm strategy, the net hedging impact (the extent to which the changes in value of the hedging instruments offset the change in value of the portion of the economic liability we are hedging) may be impacted by a number of factors, including: cash flow timing differences between our hedging instruments and the corresponding portion of the economic liability we are hedging, basis differences attributable to actual underlying contractholder funds to be hedged versus hedgeable indices, rebalancing costs related to dynamic rebalancing of hedging instruments as markets move, certain elements of the economic liability that may not be hedged (including certain actuarial assumptions), and implied and realized market volatility on the hedge positions relative to the portion of the economic liability we seek to hedge.
iii. capital hedge program:
we employ a capital hedge program to protect a portion of the overall capital position of the variable annuities business against its exposure to the equity markets. the capital hedge program is conducted using equity derivatives which include equity call and put options, total return swaps and futures contracts. changes in value of these derivatives are excluded from adjusted operating income, which the company believes enhances the understanding of underlying performance trends.
product specific risks and risk mitigants for certain living benefit guarantees, claims will primarily represent the funding of contractholder lifetime withdrawals after the cumulative withdrawals have first exhausted the contractholder account value. due to the age of the in-force block, limited claim payments have occurred to date, and they are not expected to increase significantly within the next five years, based upon current assumptions. the timing and amount of future claims will depend on actual returns on contractholder account value and actual contractholder behavior relative to our assumptions. the majority of our current living benefit guarantees provide for guaranteed lifetime contractholder withdrawal payments inclusive of a "highest daily" contract value guarantee. our pdi variable annuity complements our variable annuity products with the highest daily benefit and provides for guaranteed lifetime contractholder withdrawal payments but restricts contractholder asset allocation to a single bond fund sub-account within the separate accounts.
table of contents the majority of our traditional variable annuity contracts with living benefit guarantees, and contracts with our highest daily living benefit features, include risk mitigants in the form of an automatic rebalancing feature and/or inclusion in our alm strategy. we may also utilize external reinsurance as a form of additional risk mitigation. the risks associated with the guaranteed benefits of certain legacy products that were sold prior to our development of the automatic rebalancing feature are also managed through our alm strategy. certain legacy products with gmab rider options include the automatic rebalancing feature but are not included in the alm strategy. sales of traditional variable annuities with living benefit guarantees and automatic rebalancing features were discontinued as of december 31, 2020, and, in april 2022, the sale of a portion of our in-force traditional variable annuity block was completed, as discussed above.
for our gmdbs, we provide a benefit payable in the event of death. our base gmdb is generally equal to a return of cumulative deposits adjusted for any partial withdrawals. certain products include an optional enhanced gmdb based on the greater of a minimum return on the contract value or an enhanced value. we have retained the risk that the total amount of death benefit payable may be greater than the contractholder account value; however, a substantial portion of the account values associated with gmdbs are subject to an automatic rebalancing feature because the contractholder also selected a living benefit guarantee which includes an automatic rebalancing feature. all of the variable annuity account values with living benefit guarantees also contain gmdbs. the living and death benefit features for these contracts cover the same insured life and, consequently, we have insured both the longevity and mortality risk on these contracts.
the following table sets forth the risk management profile of our living benefit guarantees and gmdb features as of the periods indicated:

(3)represents the change in the liability (excluding npr) for our variable annuities living benefit guarantees, which is measured utilizing a valuation methodology that is required under u.s. gaap. this liability includes such items as risk margins which are required by u.s. gaap but not included in our best estimate of the liability.
(4)represents the change in fair value of the derivatives utilized to hedge potential claims associated with our variable annuity living benefit guarantees.
(5)represents the changes in fair value of equity derivatives of the capital hedge program intended to protect a portion of the overall capital position of the variable annuities business against its exposure to the equity markets.
(6)largely represents realized gains (losses) associated with sales and changes in the market value of fixed maturity securities as well as changes in the market value of derivative instruments.
(7)represents the immediate impacts in current period results from changes in current market conditions on estimates of profitability.
(8)excludes amounts from the change in unrealized gains and losses on fixed income instruments recorded in oci (versus net income) of ($289) million, ($1,727) million and $1,384 million as of december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
for 2022, the loss of $2,054 million was driven by the impact of rising interest rates on fixed maturity securities and derivatives as well as unfavorable impacts related to the amortization of dac and other costs. these losses were partially offset by favorable npr adjustments largely due to favorable impacts from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements and widening credit spreads, gains associated with our capital hedges driven by unfavorable equity markets as well as favorable market experience updates resulting from the impact of rising interest rates. changes related to the u.s. gaap liability before npr and the fair value of hedge assets (excluding capital hedges) were largely offsetting.

(1)ratio of policyholder benefits to earned premiums plus policy charges and fee income.
(2)benefits ratios reflect the impacts of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding these impacts, the group life, group disability and total group insurance benefits ratios were 93.3%, 73.3% and 88.4% for 2022, respectively, 102.7%, 83.8% and 98.3% for 2021, respectively, and 93.6%, 78.8% and 90.4% for 2020, respectively.
(4)the benefits and administrative ratios are measures used to evaluate profitability and efficiency.
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $439 million, including an unfavorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2022 included a $3 million net charge from these updates while 2021 included a $1 million net benefit from these updates. excluding this item, adjusted operating income increased $443 million, primarily reflecting higher underwriting results in our group life business, driven by a decline in covid-19 impacts on non-experience-rated contracts, and higher underwriting results in our group disability business driven by more favorable claims experience and a favorable impact to reserves from higher interest rates on long-term disability contracts, as well as business growth. these increases were partially offset by lower net investment spread results driven by lower income on non-coupon investments.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. revenues decreased $94 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, revenues decreased $90 million. the decrease primarily reflected lower net investment income driven by lower income on non-coupon investments.
benefits and expenses decreased $533 million. the decrease primarily reflected lower policyholders' benefits and changes in reserves in our group life business driven by less unfavorable claim experience from a decline in covid-19 impacts, as well as in our group disability business driven by a more favorable impact from claims experience and a favorable impact to reserves from higher interest rates on long-term disability contracts.
sales results the following table sets forth group insurance's annualized new business premiums, as defined under "-segment measures" above, for the periods indicated:
annualized new business premiums(1):
group disability                                 196       221                       163
(1)amounts exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage under our servicemembers' group life insurance contract and from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts.
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. total annualized new business premiums decreased $7 million, primarily driven by lower sales in our group disability business in the national segment due to the absence of a large sale in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in supplemental health product sales, primarily in the premier segment. higher group life sales, primarily in the national segment, served as a partial offset.

2022 to 2021 annual comparison. adjusted operating income decreased $1,608 million, primarily reflecting an unfavorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2022 included a $1,401 million net charge from these updates, mainly driven by unfavorable impacts related to assumptions for policyholder behavior and mortality, and inclusive of out of period adjustments (see note 1 and note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information). results for 2021 included a $7 million net benefit from these updates. excluding this item, adjusted operating income decreased $200 million, primarily reflecting lower net investment spread results driven by lower income on non-coupon investments, partially offset by higher underwriting results, driven by the impact from less unfavorable mortality experience, net of reinsurance, including lower covid-19 related claims.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. revenues increased $177 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, revenues decreased $163 million. this decrease was primarily driven by lower policy charges and fee income, driven by the absence of a benefit from the recapture of previously reinsured liabilities in the prior year period, which was mostly offset by reserve changes in policyholders' benefits, as well as the impact of unfavorable equity markets on account values. also contributing to the decrease was lower net investment income driven by lower income on non-coupon investments, partially offset by business growth and higher interest rates. these decreases were partially offset by higher premiums due to lower ceded reinsurance, which was mostly offset in policyholders' benefits below.
table of contents benefits and expenses increased $1,785 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $37 million. this increase was primarily driven by higher interest credited on policyholders' account balances due to business growth and higher interest expense driven by higher interest rates, as discussed above. these increases were partially offset by lower policyholders' benefits and changes in reserves, driven by a favorable comparative impact from mortality experience, net of reinsurance, including lower covid-19 related claims, and the absence of a charge from the reinsurance recapture in the prior year period, as described above, partially offset by lower ceded reinsurance, as described above.

2022 to 2021 annual comparison. adjusted operating income increased $29 million, including an unfavorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2022 included a $17 million net charge from these updates primarily reflecting updates to persistency assumptions in the medicare line. excluding this item, adjusted operating income increased $46 million primarily reflecting an increase in the medicare line driven by higher commission revenue, partially offset by a decrease in the health under 65 line driven by lower commission and case referral revenues.
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. revenues decreased $48 million. excluding the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, as discussed above, revenues decreased $31 million, primarily due to lower commission and case referral revenues in the health under 65 and life lines, as well as lower case referral revenue in the personal finance line. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in commission revenue in the medicare line. expenses decreased $77 million, primarily driven by lower variable expenses from the life, health under 65 and personal finance lines, partially offset by higher variable expenses from the medicare line, as well as higher general and administrative expenses.

2022 to 2021 annual comparison. adjusted operating income from our life planner operations decreased $336 million, including a net unfavorable impact of $23 million from currency fluctuations, inclusive of the currency hedging program discussed above. both periods also include the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, which resulted in a $19 million net charge in 2022 compared to a $2 million net benefit in 2021.
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, as well as the impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements as discussed above, adjusted operating income from our life planner operations decreased $292 million, primarily reflecting lower net investment spread results driven by lower income on non-coupon investments, lower underwriting results, primarily driven by unfavorable policyholder behavior and unfavorable mortality and morbidity experience from covid-19 related claims in japan, and higher operating expenses.
adjusted operating income from our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $650 million, including a net favorable impact of $11 million from currency fluctuations, inclusive of the currency hedging program discussed above. both periods also include the impact of our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements, which resulted in a $12 million net charge in 2022 compared to a $16 million net charge in 2021.
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, as well as the impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements as discussed above, adjusted operating income from our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $665 million, primarily reflecting lower net investment spread results driven by lower income on non-coupon investments and lower prepayment fee income, as well as lower underwriting results, primarily driven by unfavorable mortality and morbidity experience from covid-19 related claims in japan. also contributing to the decrease were lower earnings from joint venture investments.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. revenues from our life planner operations decreased $580 million, including a net unfavorable impact of $632 million from currency fluctuations and a net benefit of $12 million from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding these items, revenues increased $40 million, primarily reflecting higher premiums and policy charges and fee income, driven by the growth of business in force, partially offset by lower net investment income driven by lower income on non-coupon investments.
table of contents benefits and expenses from our life planner operations decreased $244 million, including a net favorable impact of $609 million from currency fluctuations and a net charge of $33 million from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding these items, benefits and expenses increased $332 million, primarily reflecting higher policyholders' benefits, including changes in reserves, driven by unfavorable mortality and morbidity experience from covid-19 related claims, higher amortization, including write offs of deferred policy acquisition costs related to unfavorable policyholder behavior, and higher operating expenses.
revenues from our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $1,261 million, including a net unfavorable impact of $865 million from currency fluctuations. excluding this item, revenues decreased $396 million, primarily reflecting lower premiums and policy charges and fee income due to the decline of business in force, lower net investment income driven by lower income on non-coupon investments and lower prepayment fee income, and lower other income from a decline in earnings from joint venture investments.
benefits and expenses from our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $611 million, including a net favorable impact of $876 million from currency fluctuations and a net benefit of $4 million from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. excluding these items, benefits and expenses increased $269 million, primarily reflecting higher policyholders' benefits, including changes in reserves, driven by unfavorable mortality and morbidity experience from covid-19 related claims, and higher amortization, including write offs of deferred policy acquisition costs related to unfavorable policyholder behavior.

annualized new business premiums:
on an actual exchange rate basis:
on a constant exchange rate basis:
the amount of annualized new business premiums and the sales mix in terms of types and currency denomination of products for any given period can be significantly impacted by several factors, including but not limited to: the addition of new products, discontinuation of existing products, changes in credited interest rates for certain products and other product modifications, changes in premium rates, changes in interest rates or fluctuations in currency markets, changes in tax laws, changes in life insurance regulations or changes in the competitive environment. sales volume may increase or decrease prior to certain of these changes becoming effective, and then fluctuate in the other direction following such changes.
our diverse product portfolio in japan, in terms of currency mix and premium payment structure, allows us to adapt to changing market and competitive dynamics, including the low interest rate environment. we regularly examine our product offerings and their related profitability and, as a result, we have repriced or discontinued sales of certain products that do not meet our profit expectations. the impact of these actions, coupled with the introduction of certain new products, has generally resulted in an increase in sales of products denominated in usd relative to products denominated in other currencies.
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. the table below presents annualized new business premiums on a constant exchange rate basis, by product category and distribution channel, for the periods indicated:

(3)single pay life annualized new business premiums, which include 10% of first year premiums, and 3-year limited pay annualized new business premiums, which include 100% of new business premiums, represented 0% and 51%, respectively, of total japanese bank distribution channel annualized new business premiums, excluding investment contracts, for the year ended december 31, 2022, and 3% and 66%, respectively, of total japanese bank distribution channel annualized new business premiums, excluding investment contracts, for the year ended december 31, 2021.
annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our life planner operations increased $62 million, primarily driven by higher life product sales in brazil and argentina. in japan, higher sales of usd-denominated market value adjusted investment contacts, driven by higher interest rates, were partially offset by lower sales of usd-denominated retirement products.
annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our gibraltar life and other operations decreased $98 million. bank channel sales decreased $150 million reflecting lower usd-denominated life product sales, partially offset by higher sales of usd-denominated market value adjusted investment contacts, driven by higher interest rates. life consultants sales increased $51 million reflecting higher sales of usd-denominated market value adjusted investment contacts, driven by rising interest rates, partially offset by lower usd-denominated life product sales. independent agency sales increased $1 million, primarily driven by higher sales of life products and usd-denominated endowment products, largely offset by the absence of accident & health product sales made to a single large client in the prior year period and lower sales of investment contracts.
sales force the following table sets forth the number of life planners and life consultants for the periods indicated:
2022 to 2021 comparison. the number of life planners decreased by 100, driven by a decrease of 120 in our japan operations, primarily reflecting our selective recruiting efforts and higher resignations. life planners in our other operations increased by 20, primarily reflecting an increase in brazil. the number of gibraltar life consultants decreased by 279, primarily reflecting continued recruiting challenges and higher resignations due to more selective retention standards.
corporate and other corporate and other includes corporate operations, after allocations to our business segments, and divested and run-off businesses other than those that qualify for "discontinued operations" accounting treatment under u.s. gaap.

2022 to 2021 annual comparison. the loss from corporate and other operations, on an adjusted operating income basis, decreased $131 million. pension and employee benefits were favorable by $103 million, driven by higher earnings from our pension and post-retirement plans resulting from higher returns on plan assets, lower benefit costs for these plans resulting from the sale of the full service retirement business, and a favorable impact from design changes to the company's retiree medical savings account plan. net charges from other corporate activities decreased by $27 million, primarily driven by the absence of costs related to the early extinguishment of debt in the prior year period, favorable exchange rate impacts, gains from the sales of certain home office properties, and lower costs for long-term compensation plans, partially offset by higher expenses, including an increase in costs related to corporate initiatives.
for purposes of calculating pension income from our qualified pension plan for the year ended december 31, 2023, we increased the discount rate from 2.85% to 5.45% as of december 31, 2022. the expected rate of return on plan assets increased from 6.00% in 2022 to 7.50% in 2023. the assumed rate of increase in compensation remained unchanged at 4.50%. giving effect to the foregoing changes and other factors, we expect income from our qualified pension plan in 2023 to be approximately $20 million to $30 million higher than 2022 levels. this increase is primarily driven by higher earnings from an increase in the expected rate of return and lower loss amortization, partially offset by higher interest costs on the plan obligation due to a higher discount rate.
for purposes of calculating postretirement benefit expenses for the year ended december 31, 2023, we increased the discount rate from 2.75% to 5.55% as of december 31, 2022. the expected rate of return on plan assets increased from 7.00% in 2022 to 7.75% in 2023. giving effect to the foregoing changes and other factors, we expect postretirement income in 2023 to be approximately $30 million to $40 million lower than 2022 levels. this decrease is primarily driven by higher interest costs on the plan obligation due to a higher discount rate and unfavorable equity returns in 2022, partially offset by higher earnings from an increase in the expected rate of return and lower loss amortization.
in 2023, pension and other postretirement benefit service costs related to active employees will continue to be allocated to our business segments. for further information regarding our pension and postretirement plans, including the changes to the company's retiree medical savings account plan, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
divested and run-off businesses divested and run-off businesses included in corporate and other income from our divested and run-off businesses includes results from several businesses that have been or will be sold or exited, including businesses that have been placed in wind down status that do not qualify for "discontinued operations" accounting treatment under u.s. gaap. the results of these divested and run-off businesses are reflected in our corporate and other operations but are excluded from adjusted operating income. a summary of the results of the divested and run-off businesses reflected in our corporate and other operations is as follows for the periods indicated:
total divested and run-off businesses income (loss) excluded from adjusted operating income                        $9                      $716                   $(450)
long-term care. results for the year ended december 31, 2022 decreased $876 million compared to 2021, including an unfavorable comparative net impact from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements. results for 2022 included a $28 million net charge from these updates, while results for 2021 included a $62 million net benefit. excluding this item, results decreased $786 million primarily driven by unfavorable impacts from changes in the market value of equity securities, changes in the market value of derivatives used for duration management and lower income on non-coupon investments.
other divested and run-off businesses. results for the year ended december 31, 2022 increased $169 million compared to 2021, primarily driven by the gain on the sale of the full service retirement business. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this sale. the results for 2022 also include losses related to the full service retirement business in the first quarter, largely driven by the impact of rising interest rates on the market value of assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities. for additional information, see "-experience-rated contractholder liabilities, assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and other related investments."
closed block division the closed block division includes certain in-force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies (collectively, the "closed block"), as well as certain related assets and liabilities. we no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
each year, the board of directors of the prudential insurance company of america ("pica") determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the closed block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses), mortality experience and other factors. although the closed block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results, at the time the closed block was established, we developed, as required by u.s. gaap, an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block. actual cumulative earnings, as required by u.s. gaap, reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period, as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the closed block policies. if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected, we record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation. additionally, any accumulated net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block are reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation, with a corresponding amount reported in aoci, while any accumulated net unrealized investment losses are reflected as a reduction of the policyholder dividend obligation, to the extent the overall policyholder dividend obligation is otherwise positive.
we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected. the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block division will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of pica. if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, earnings volatility in the closed block division, which is primarily due to changes in investment results, may not be offset by changes in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation. for a discussion of the closed block division's realized investment gains (losses), net, see "-general account investments."
as of december 31, 2022, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $3,207 million; however, due to the accumulation of net unrealized investment losses in excess of this amount, the policyholder dividend obligation balance as of december 31, 2022 was reduced to zero.
operating results the following table sets forth the closed block division's results for the periods indicated:
benefits and expenses                                                                        2,989                           5,807                   4,790
income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures         $(32)                            $140                   $(24)
income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures decreased $172 million. net investment activity results decreased primarily reflecting lower other income driven by unfavorable changes in the value of equity securities, a decrease in realized investment gains (losses) driven by losses on the sale of fixed income investments in the current year, and lower net investment income on non-coupon investments. net insurance activity results increased driven by a favorable comparative change in claims experience and reserves, partially offset by lower premiums due to the runoff of policies in force. as a result of the above, a $1,180 million reduction in the policyholder dividend obligation was recorded in 2022, compared to a $1,469 million increase in 2021.
revenues, benefits and expenses
2022 to 2021 annual comparison. revenues decreased $2,990 million primarily driven by a decrease in other income, realized investment gains (losses), net investment income and premiums, as discussed above.
benefits and expenses decreased $2,818 million primarily driven by a decrease in dividends to policyholders, reflecting a reduction in the policyholder dividend obligation expense due to changes in cumulative earnings, as discussed above.

table of contents effective tax rate the effective tax rate is the ratio of "total income tax expense (benefit)" divided by "income before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures." our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was 20.8%, 17.8%, and 25.1%, respectively. for a detailed description of the nature of each significant reconciling item, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
unrecognized tax benefits the company's liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities. the completion of review or the expiration of the federal statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. the total unrecognized benefit as of december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $84 million, $12 million and $17 million, respectively. the company cannot predict with reasonable accuracy whether there will be any significant changes within the next twelve months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.
income tax expense vs. income tax paid in cash income tax expense recorded under u.s. gaap routinely differs from the income taxes paid in cash in any given year. income tax expense recorded under u.s. gaap is based on income reported in our consolidated statements of operations for the current period and it includes both current and deferred taxes. income taxes paid during the year include tax installments made for the current year as well as tax payments and refunds related to prior periods.
for additional information regarding income tax related items, see "business-regulation" and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
experience-rated contractholder liabilities, assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and other related investments international businesses. certain products included in our international businesses are experience-rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. the majority of investments supporting these experience-rated products are carried at fair value. these experience-rated products are fully participating, and as a result, the entire return on the underlying investments is passed back to policyholders through a corresponding adjustment to the related liability. the investments and related liabilities are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial position as "assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities, at fair value" and "policyholders' account balances," respectively the associated realized and unrealized gains (losses) on the investments are reported on the consolidated statements of operations as "other income (loss)", while interest and dividend income are reported in "net investment income."
adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains (losses) on assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities. this is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains (losses) with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis. in addition, to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains (losses) on investments, adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments supporting these experience-rated contracts, which are reflected in "interest credited to policyholders' account balances." the result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest spread we earn on these experience-rated contracts, and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments, both realized and unrealized, that we expect will ultimately accrue to the contractholders.
full service retirement business. prior to the second quarter of 2022, the full service retirement business included within the company's divested and run-off businesses held two types of experience-rated products that were supported by assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and other related investments. on april 1, 2022, the company completed the sale of its full service retirement business to great-west. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this disposition.

for our divested full service retirement business, the net impact of changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities and investment gains (losses) on assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and other related investments reflects timing differences between the recognition of the mark-to-market adjustments and the recognition of the recovery of these adjustments in future periods through subsequent increases in asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities for partially participating products. this includes certain assets that are designated as available-for-sale where mark-to-market adjustments are recorded as unrealized gains (losses) in "other comprehensive income". these impacts also reflect the difference between the fair value of underlying commercial mortgages and other loans and the amortized cost, less any valuation allowance, of these loans.
valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities the authoritative guidance related to fair value measurement establishes a framework that includes a three-level hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. the level in the hierarchy within which the fair value falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement. the fair values of assets and liabilities classified as level 3 include at least one significant unobservable input in the measurement. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for an additional description of the valuation hierarchy levels as well as for the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by hierarchy level presented on a consolidated basis.
the table below presents the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as of the periods indicated, and the portion of such assets and liabilities that are classified in level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. the table also provides details about these assets and liabilities excluding those held in the closed block division. we believe the amounts excluding the closed block division are most relevant to an understanding of our operations that are pertinent to investors in prudential financial because substantially all closed block division assets support obligations and liabilities relating to the closed block policies only. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the closed block.

(1)excludes amounts for financial instruments reclassified to "assets held-for-sale" of $129,579 million and "liabilities held-for-sale" of $6,214 million. assets held-for-sale and liabilities held-for-sale are valued on a basis consistent with similar instruments described herein. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(2)level 3 assets expressed as a percentage of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis for pfi excluding the closed block division and for the closed block division totaled 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively, as of december 31, 2022 and 1.6% and 4.0%, respectively, as of december 31, 2021.
(3)"all other" represents cash equivalents and short-term investments.
(4)"other invested assets" and "other liabilities" primarily include derivatives. the amounts include the impact of netting subject to master netting agreements.
the determination of fair value, which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, can have a significant impact on our results of operations and may require the application of a greater degree of judgment depending on market conditions, as the ability to value assets and liabilities can be significantly impacted by a decrease in market activity or a lack of transactions executed in an orderly manner.
fixed maturity securities included in level 3 in our fair value hierarchy are generally priced based on internally-developed valuations or indicative broker quotes. for certain private fixed maturity and equity securities, the internal valuation models use significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, such securities are included in level 3 in our fair value hierarchy. level 3 fixed maturity securities for pfi excluding the closed block division included approximately $1.1 billion of public fixed maturities as of december 31, 2022 with values primarily based on indicative broker quotes, and approximately $3.5 billion of private fixed maturities, with values primarily based on internally-developed models. significant unobservable inputs used in their valuation included: issue specific spread adjustments, material non-public financial information, management judgment, estimation of future earnings and cash flows, default rate assumptions, liquidity assumptions and indicative quotes from market makers. separate account assets included in level 3 in our fair value hierarchy primarily include corporate securities and commercial mortgage loans.
embedded derivatives reported in "future policy benefits" and "policyholders' account balances" that are included in level 3 of our fair value hierarchy represent general account liabilities pertaining to living benefit features of the company's table of contents variable annuity contracts and the index-linked interest credited features on certain life and annuity products. these are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in "realized investment gains (losses), net." these embedded derivatives are valued using internally-developed models that require significant estimates and assumptions developed by management. changes in these estimates and assumptions can have a significant impact on the results of our operations.
for additional information about the valuation techniques and the key estimates and assumptions used in our determination of fair value, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
general account investments we maintain diversified investment portfolios in our general account to support our liabilities to customers as well as our other general liabilities. investments and other assets that do not support general account liabilities, and are therefore excluded from our general account, are as follows:
•assets of our derivative operations;
•assets of our investment management operations, including investments managed for third-parties; and
•those assets classified as "separate account assets" on our balance sheet.
the general account portfolios are managed pursuant to the distinct objectives and investment policy statements of pfi excluding the closed block division and of the closed block division. the primary investment objectives of pfi excluding the closed block division include:
•hedging and otherwise managing the market risk characteristics of the major product liabilities and other obligations of the company;
•optimizing investment income yield within risk constraints over time; and
•for certain portfolios, optimizing total return, including both investment income yield and capital appreciation, within risk constraints over time, while managing the market risk exposures associated with the corresponding product liabilities.
we pursue our objective to optimize investment income yield for pfi excluding the closed block division over time through:
•the investment of net operating cash flows, including new product premium inflows, and proceeds from investment sales, repayments and prepayments into investments with attractive risk-adjusted yields; and
•the sale of investments, where appropriate, either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio's risk exposure profile with respect to duration, credit, currency and other risk factors, while considering the impact on taxes and capital.
the primary investment objectives of the closed block division include:
•providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block division; and
•optimizing total return, including both investment income yield and capital appreciation, within risk constraints, while managing the market risk exposures associated with the major products in the closed block division.
our portfolio management approach, while emphasizing our investment income yield and asset/liability risk management objectives, also takes into account the capital and tax implications of portfolio activity and our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold debt securities to recovery. for a further discussion of our allowance for credit losses, including our assertions regarding any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery, see "-realized investment gains and losses-credit losses" below.
management of investments the investment committee of our board of directors ("board") oversees our proprietary investments, including our general account portfolios, and regularly reviews performance and risk positions. our chief investment officer organization ("cio organization") develops investment policies subject to risk limits proposed by our enterprise risk management ("erm") group for the general account portfolios of our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries and directs and oversees management of the general account portfolios within risk limits and exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee.
table of contents the cio organization, including related functions within our insurance subsidiaries, works closely with product actuaries and erm to understand the characteristics of our products and their associated market risk exposures. this information is incorporated into the development of target asset portfolios that manage market risk exposures associated with the liability characteristics and establish investment risk exposures, within tolerances prescribed by prudential's investment risk limits, on which we expect to earn an attractive risk-adjusted return. we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus, each with distinct risk characteristics. market risk exposures associated with the liabilities include interest rate risk, which is addressed through the duration characteristics of the target asset mix, and currency risk, which is addressed by the currency profile of the target asset mix. in certain of our smaller markets outside of the u.s. and japan, capital markets limitations hinder our ability to hedge interest rate exposure to the same extent we do for our u.s. and japan businesses and lead us to accept a higher degree of interest rate risk in these smaller portfolios. general account portfolios typically include allocations to credit and other investment risks as a means to enhance investment yields and returns over time.
•interest-crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience, such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance;
•participating individual and experience-rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends, interest or return of premium; and
•products with fixed or guaranteed terms, such as traditional whole life and endowment products, guaranteed investment contracts ("gics"), funding agreements and payout annuities.
our total investment portfolio is composed of a number of operating portfolios. each operating portfolio backs a specific set of liabilities, and the portfolios have a target asset mix that supports the liability characteristics, including duration, cash flow, liquidity needs and other criteria. as of december 31, 2022, the average duration of our domestic general account investment portfolios attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division, including the impact of derivatives, was approximately 7 years. as of december 31, 2022, the average duration of our international general account portfolios attributable to our japanese insurance operations, including the impact of derivatives, was between 11 and 12 years and represented a blend of yen-denominated and u.s. dollar and australian dollar-denominated investments, which have distinct average durations supporting the insurance liabilities we have issued in those currencies. our asset/liability management process has enabled us to manage our portfolios through several market cycles.
we implement our portfolio strategies primarily through investment in a broad range of fixed income assets, including government and agency securities, public and private corporate bonds and structured securities and commercial mortgage loans. in addition, we hold allocations of non-coupon investments, which include equity securities and other invested assets such as lps/llcs, real estate held through direct ownership, derivative instruments, and seed money investments in separate accounts.
we manage our public fixed maturity portfolio to a risk profile directed or overseen by the cio organization and erm groups and to a profile that also reflects the market environments impacting both our domestic and international insurance portfolios. the return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected in investment income and in realized gains or losses on investments.
we use privately-placed corporate debt securities and commercial mortgage loans, which consist of mortgages on diversified properties in terms of geography, property type and borrowers, to enhance the yield on our portfolio and to improve the overall diversification of the portfolios. private placements typically offer enhanced yields due to an illiquidity premium and generally offer enhanced credit protection in the form of covenants. our origination capability offers the opportunity to lead transactions and gives us the opportunity for better terms, including covenants and call protection, and to take advantage of innovative deal structures.
derivative strategies are employed in the context of our risk management framework to enhance our ability to manage interest rate and currency risk exposures of the asset portfolio relative to the liabilities and to manage credit and equity positions in the investment portfolios. for a discussion of our risk management process, see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" below.
our portfolio asset allocation reflects our emphasis on diversification across asset classes, sectors and issuers. the cio organization, directly and through related functions within the insurance subsidiaries, implements portfolio strategies primarily through various investment management units within prudential's pgim segment. activities of the pgim segment on behalf of the general account portfolios are directed and overseen by the cio organization and monitored by erm for compliance with investment risk limits.
table of contents in executing the activities on behalf of the general account portfolio, prudential investment management units are incorporating environmental, social and governance factors into their respective investment processes as appropriate. these factors include investing in opportunities to support diversity and inclusion and to help mitigate climate change by pursuing relevant investments across asset classes.
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, policy loans and non-coupon investments as defined above. the composition of our general account reflects, within the discipline provided by our risk management approach, our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our pgim segment. the size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor.
the following tables set forth the composition of our general account investment portfolio apportioned between pfi excluding the closed block division and the closed block division, as of the dates indicated:

the decrease in general account investments related to our japanese insurance operations in 2022 was primarily attributable to an increase in u.s. interest rates and the translation impact of the u.s. dollar strengthening against the yen, partially offset by the reinvestment of net investment income and net business inflows.
as of december 31, 2022, our japanese insurance operations had $77.5 billion, at carrying value, of investments denominated in u.s. dollars, including $1.5 billion that were hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts and $67.4 billion that support liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars, with the remainder constituting part of the hedging of foreign currency exchange rate exposure to u.s. dollar-equivalent equity. as of december 31, 2021, our japanese insurance operations had $92.5 billion, at carrying value, of investments denominated in u.s. dollars, including $2.1 billion that were hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts and $80.2 billion that support liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars, with the remainder constituting part of the hedging of foreign currency exchange rate exposure to u.s. dollar-equivalent equity. the $15.0 billion decrease in the carrying value of u.s. dollar-denominated investments from december 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in u.s. interest rates, partially offset by reinvestment of net investment income.
our japanese insurance operations had $5.2 billion and $8.0 billion, at carrying value, of investments denominated in australian dollars that support liabilities denominated in australian dollars as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the $2.8 billion decrease in the carrying value of australian dollar-denominated investments from december 31, 2021 was primarily attributable to run-off of the portfolio and an increase in australian government bond rates. for additional information regarding u.s. and australian dollar investments held in our japanese insurance operations and a discussion of our yen hedging strategy, see "results of operations by segment-impact of foreign currency exchange rates" above.

(1)the denominator in the yield percentage is based on quarterly average carrying values for all asset types except for fixed maturities which are based on amortized cost, net of allowance. amounts for fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash equivalents are also netted for securities lending activity (i.e., income netted for rebate expenses and asset values netted for securities lending liabilities). a yield is not presented for other invested assets as it is not considered a meaningful measure of investment performance. yields exclude investment income and assets related to other invested assets.
(2)includes fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity and excludes fixed maturity securities classified as trading, which are included in other invested assets.
(3)other invested assets consist of investments in lps/llcs, investment real estate held through direct ownership, derivative instruments, fixed maturities classified as trading and other miscellaneous investments.
(4)includes net investment income of our investment management operations.
(5)the total yield was 3.54%, 3.57% and 3.54% for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(6)the denominator in the yield percentage includes "assets held-for-sale". see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the decrease in investment income after investment expenses yield attributable to our general account investments, excluding both the closed block division and the japanese insurance operations' portfolio, for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to lower prepayment income, asset sales within the palac and full service retirement businesses, and reinvestment at lower rates for a portion of 2022, partially offset by higher returns on short-term investments based on an increase in short-term rates.
the increase in investment income after investment expenses yield attributable to the japanese insurance operations' portfolio for 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of higher returns on short-term investments based on an increase in short-term rates and higher fixed income reinvestment rates.
both the u.s. dollar-denominated and australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts provide a yield that is substantially higher than the yield on comparable yen-denominated fixed maturities. the average amortized cost of u.s. dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts was approximately $60.0 billion and $60.5 billion, for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the majority of u.s. dollar-denominated fixed maturities support liabilities that are denominated in u.s. dollars. the average amortized cost of australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third-party derivative contracts was approximately $6.1 billion and $7.9 billion, for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the majority of australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities support liabilities that are denominated in australian dollars. for additional information regarding u.s. and australian dollar investments held in our japanese insurance operations, see "-results of operations by segment-impact of foreign currency exchange rates" above.

2022 to 2021 annual comparison net losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were $1,027 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 primarily driven by rotation sales of public securities into private securities and mortgage loans coupled with relative value trading in a higher interest rate environment, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on u.s. and australian dollar-denominated securities that matured or were sold within our international businesses segment. net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were $1,445 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 primarily driven by sales of u.s. treasuries acquired in a higher interest-rate environment within our domestic segments and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on u.s. and australian dollar-denominated securities that matured or were sold within our international businesses segment.
net realized losses on derivative instruments of $2,060 million, for the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily included:
•$1,692 million of gains on product-related embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity contracts;
•$402 million of gains on capital hedges due to decreases in equity indices; and
•$329 million of gains on foreign currency hedges due to u.s. dollar appreciation versus the euro, british pound, and australian dollar.
net realized gains on derivative instruments of $1,463 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily included:
•$2,471 million of gains on product-related embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity contracts; and

included in the table above are "related adjustments," which include the portions of "realized investment gains (losses), net" that are either (1) included in adjusted operating income or (2) included in other reconciling line items to adjusted operating income, such as "market experience updates" and "divested and run-off businesses." "related adjustments" also includes the portions of "other income (loss)" and "net investment income" that are excluded from adjusted operating income. these adjustments are made to arrive at "realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments" which is excluded from adjusted operating income. see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on adjusted operating income and its reconciliation to "income (loss) before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures." results for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 reflect net related adjustments of $(2,571) million and $(1,270) million, respectively. both periods include changes in the fair value of equity securities and fixed income securities that are designated as trading, as well as settlements and changes in the value of derivatives. additionally, the results for 2022 include the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain non-local currency denominated assets and liabilities.
also included in the table above are "charges related to realized investment gains (losses), net," which are excluded from adjusted operating income and which may be reflected as either a net charge or net benefit. results for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 reflect net charges of $531 million and $320 million, respectively, and were primarily driven by the impact of derivative activity on the amortization of dac and other costs, and certain policyholder reserves, inclusive of impacts from our annual reviews and update of assumptions and other refinements.
table of contents credit losses the level of credit losses generally reflects current and expected economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve. historically, the causes of credit losses have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in credit losses to other securities within the same industry or geographic region. we may also realize additional credit and interest rate-related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives.
we maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management. for private placements, our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management. we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish "checks and balances" for new investments. we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions, whether they originate through our own in-house staff or through agents. our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions. we set all valuation standards centrally, and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly. our public and private fixed maturity investment managers formally review all public and private fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances and/or company or industry-specific concerns.
for lps/llcs accounted for using the equity method and for wholly-owned investment real estate, the carrying value of these investments is written down or impaired to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. for additional information regarding our otti policies, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

(1)investment data has been classified based on standard industry categorizations for domestic public holdings and similar classifications by industry for all other holdings.
fixed maturity securities credit quality the securities valuation office ("svo") of the national association of insurance commissioners ("naic") evaluates the investments of insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called "naic designations." in general, naic designations of "1" highest quality, or "2" high quality, include fixed maturities considered investment grade, which include securities rated baa3 or higher by moody's investor service, inc. ("moody's") or bbb- or higher by standard & poor's rating services ("s&p"). naic designations of "3" through "6" generally include fixed maturities referred to as below investment grade, which include securities rated ba1 or lower by moody's and bb+ or lower by s&p. the naic designations for commercial mortgage-backed securities and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, including our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third-party (engaged by the naic) and the statutory carrying value of the security, including any purchase discounts or impairment charges previously recognized.
as a result of time lags between the funding of investments, the finalization of legal documents, and the completion of the svo filing process, the fixed maturity portfolio includes certain securities that have not yet been designated by the svo as of each balance sheet date. pending receipt of svo designations, the categorization of these securities by naic designation is based on the expected ratings indicated by internal analysis.
ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies include s&p, moody's, fitch ratings inc. ("fitch") and morningstar, inc. ("morningstar"). low issue composite rating uses ratings from the major credit rating agencies or if these are not available an equivalent internal rating. for securities where the ratings assigned are not equivalent, the second lowest rating is utilized.
investments of our international insurance companies are not subject to naic guidelines. investments of our japanese insurance operations are regulated locally by the financial services agency ("fsa"), an agency of the japanese government. the fsa has its own investment quality criteria and risk control standards. our japanese insurance companies comply with the fsa's credit quality review and risk monitoring guidelines. the credit quality ratings of the investments of our japanese insurance companies are based on ratings assigned by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, including moody's and s&p, or rating equivalents based on ratings assigned by japanese credit ratings agencies.

we originate commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans using a dedicated sales and underwriting staff through our various regional offices in the u.s. and international offices primarily in london and tokyo. all loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our industry experience in real estate and mortgage lending.
table of contents residential property loans primarily include japanese recourse loans. to the extent there is a default on these recourse loans, we can make a claim against the personal assets of the property owner, in addition to the mortgaged property. these loans are also backed by third-party guarantors.
other collateralized loans include mezzanine real estate debt investments and consumer loans.

loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the quality of commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans. the loan-to-value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan and is commonly expressed as a percentage. a loan-to-value ratio less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% indicate that the loan amount exceeds the collateral value. the debt service coverage ratio compares a property's net operating income to its debt service payments. debt service coverage ratios less than 1.0 times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan's current debt payments. a debt service coverage ratio greater than 1.0 times indicates an excess of net operating income over the debt service payments.
as of december 31, 2022, our commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans attributable to pfi excluding the closed block division had a weighted-average debt service coverage ratio of 2.39 times and a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 56%. as of december 31, 2022, 96% of commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans were fixed rate loans. for those commercial mortgage and agricultural property loans that were originated in 2022, the weighted-average debt service coverage ratio was 2.12 times, and the weighted-average loan-to-value ratio was 60%.
the values utilized in calculating these loan-to-value ratios are developed as part of our periodic review of the commercial mortgage and agricultural property loan portfolio, which includes an internal evaluation of the underlying collateral value. our periodic review also includes a credit quality re-rating process, whereby we update the internal quality rating originally assigned at underwriting based on the proprietary quality rating system mentioned above. as discussed below, the internal credit quality rating is a key input in determining our allowance for credit losses.
for loans with collateral under construction, renovation or lease-up, a stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios. our commercial mortgage and agricultural property loan portfolio included $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion of such loans as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. all else being equal, these loans are inherently riskier than those collateralized by properties that have already stabilized. as of both december 31, 2022 and 2021, there were less than $1 million of allowance related to these loans. in addition, these unstabilized loans are included in the calculation of our portfolio reserve, as discussed below.

commercial mortgage and other loans quality the commercial mortgage and other loans portfolio is monitored on an ongoing basis. if certain criteria are met, loans are assigned to either of the following "watch list" categories:
(1) "closely monitored," which includes a variety of considerations, such as when loan metrics fall below acceptable levels, the borrower is not cooperative or has requested a material modification, or the portfolio manager has directed a change in category; or
(2) "not in good standing," which includes loans in default or with a high probability of loss of principal, such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy.
our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list.
the current expected credit loss ("cecl") allowance represents the company's best estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining life of the assets. the determination of the allowance considers historical credit loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. the allowance is calculated separately for commercial mortgage loans, agricultural mortgage loans, uncollateralized loans, other collateralized loans and residential property loans.
for commercial mortgage and agricultural mortgage loans, the allowance is calculated using an internally developed cecl model.
key inputs to the cecl model include unpaid principal balances, internal credit ratings, annual expected loss factors, average lives of the loans adjusted for prepayment considerations, current and historical interest rate assumptions and other factors influencing the company's view of the current stage of the economic cycle and future economic conditions. subjective considerations include a review of whether historical loss experience is representative of current market conditions and the company's view of the credit cycle. model assumptions and factors are reviewed and updated as appropriate.
when individual loans no longer have the credit risk characteristics of the commercial or agricultural mortgage loan pools, they are removed from the pools and are evaluated individually for an allowance. the allowance is determined based on the outstanding loan balance less the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
the cecl allowance for other collateralized and uncollateralized loans carried at amortized cost is determined based on probability of default and loss given default assumptions by sector, credit quality and average lives of the loans.

table of contents fixed maturities, trading
"fixed maturities, trading, at fair value" are primarily related to assets associated with consolidated variable interest entities ("vies") for which the company is the investment manager. the assets of the consolidated vies are generally offset by liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected. for further information regarding these consolidated vies, see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
commercial mortgage and other loans our investment management operations include our commercial mortgage operations, which provide mortgage origination, investment management and servicing for our general account, institutional clients, the federal housing administration and government-sponsored entities such as fannie mae and freddie mac.
the mortgage loans of our commercial mortgage operations are included in "commercial mortgage and other loans." derivatives and other hedging instruments related to our commercial mortgage operations are primarily included in "other invested assets."
other invested assets
"other invested assets" primarily include assets of our derivative operations used to manage interest rate, foreign currency, credit, and equity exposures.
furthermore, other invested assets include strategic investments made as part of our investment management operations. we make these strategic investments in real estate, as well as fixed income, public equity and real estate securities, including controlling interests. certain of these investments are made primarily for purposes of co-investment in our managed funds and structured products. other strategic investments are made with the intention to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that we offer and manage (seed investments). as part of our investment management operations, we also make loans to our managed funds that are secured by equity commitments from investors or assets of the funds. "other invested assets" also includes certain assets in consolidated investment funds where the company is deemed to exercise control over the funds.
liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the company. capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of our businesses, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our businesses, general economic conditions and our access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described herein.
effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the company. management monitors the liquidity of prudential financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon. we use a risk appetite framework ("raf") to ensure that all risks taken across the company align with our capacity and willingness to take those risks. the raf provides a dynamic assessment of capital and liquidity stress impacts and is intended to ensure that sufficient resources are available to absorb those impacts. we believe that our capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to satisfy the capital and liquidity requirements of prudential financial and its subsidiaries.
see "-current market conditions" above for a discussion of recent market conditions and the impacts to our liquidity and capital positions.
our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by domestic and international regulators. these regulations currently include requirements (many of which are the subject of ongoing rule-making) relating to capital and liquidity management. for information regarding these regulatory initiatives and their potential impact on us, see "business-regulation" and "risk factors."
from the beginning of 2022 through the date of this report, we took the following significant actions that have impacted, or are expected to impact, our liquidity and capital positions:
•in april, we completed the sale of our full service retirement business. also, in april, we completed the sale of a portion of our in-force traditional variable annuities block of business through the sale of palac. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these dispositions.
•in august, we issued $1.5 billion of junior subordinated notes. we intend to use these proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the redemption or repurchase of our $1.5 billion of junior subordinated notes due in 2043.
capital our capital management framework is primarily based on statutory risk-based capital ("rbc") and solvency margin measures. due to our diverse mix of businesses and applicable regulatory requirements, we apply certain refinements to the framework that are designed to more appropriately reflect risks associated with our businesses on a consistent basis across the company.
we believe prudential financial's capitalization and financial profile are consistent with its ratings targets. our long-term senior debt rating targets for prudential financial are "a" for s&p, moody's, and fitch, and "a" for a.m. best company ("a.m. best"). our financial strength rating targets for our life insurance companies are "aa/aa/aa" for s&p, moody's and fitch, respectively, and "a+" for a.m. best. some entities may currently be rated below these targets, and not all of our insurance company subsidiaries are rated by each of these rating agencies. see "-ratings" below for a description of the potential impacts of ratings downgrades.
capital governance our capital management framework is ultimately reviewed and approved by our board. the board has authorized our chairman and chief executive officer and vice chair to approve certain capital actions on behalf of the company and to further delegate authority with respect to capital actions to appropriate officers, up to specified limits. any capital commitment that exceeds the authority granted to senior management must be separately authorized by the board.
in addition, our capital and finance committee ("cfc") reviews the use and allocation of capital above certain threshold amounts to promote the efficient use of capital, consistent with our strategic objectives, ratings aspirations and other goals and targets. this management committee provides a multi-disciplinary due diligence review of specific initiatives or transactions requiring the use of capital, including mergers and acquisitions. the cfc also reviews our annual capital plan (and updates to this plan), as well as our capital, liquidity and financial position, borrowing plans, and related matters prior to the discussion of these items with the board.
capitalization the primary components of the company's capitalization consist of equity and outstanding capital debt, including junior subordinated debt. as shown in the table below, as of december 31, 2022, the company had $50.1 billion in capital, all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its businesses and its corporate and other operations. based on our assessment of these businesses and operations, we believe this level of capital is consistent with our ratings targets.
equity(1)                                                        $36,077                     $40,552

(1)amounts attributable to prudential financial, excluding aoci.
insurance regulatory capital we manage pica, the prudential life insurance company, ltd. ("prudential of japan"), gibraltar life, and other significant insurance subsidiaries to regulatory capital levels consistent with our "aa" ratings targets. we utilize the rbc ratio table of contents as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our domestic insurance subsidiaries and the solvency margin ratio as a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our japanese insurance subsidiaries.
rbc is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with the practices of the naic. rbc considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance related risks associated with an insurer's products and liabilities, interest rate risks, and general business risks. rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring an insurer's solvency and ability to pay future claims. the reporting of rbc measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising, or promotional activities, but is available to the public.
pica's rbc ratio as of december 31, 2021, its most recent statutory fiscal year-end and rbc reporting date, was 456%. pica's rbc ratio is calculated on a consolidated basis and included prudential retirement insurance and annuity company ("priac"), pruco life insurance company ("pruco life"), pruco life insurance company of new jersey ("plnj"), which is a subsidiary of pruco life, and prudential legacy insurance company of new jersey ("plic").
although not yet filed, we expect these rbc ratios as of december 31, 2022 to be above our "aa" financial strength target levels.
similar to the rbc ratios that are employed by u.s. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies based on local statutory accounting practices. these solvency margins are a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our international insurance operations. maintenance of our solvency margins at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning, as in certain jurisdictions, such as japan, these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer's financial strength.
the table below presents the solvency margin ratios of our most significant international insurance subsidiaries as of september 30, 2022, the most recent date for which this information is available.
(2)includes prudential gibraltar financial life insurance co., ltd. ("pgfl"), a subsidiary of gibraltar life.
although not yet filed, we expect the solvency margin ratio for each of these subsidiaries to be greater than 700% (3.5 times the regulatory required minimums) as of december 31, 2022.
all of our domestic and significant international insurance subsidiaries have capital levels that substantially exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations. the statutory capital of our insurance companies and our overall capital flexibility could be impacted by, among other things, market conditions and changes in insurance reserves, including those stemming from updates to our actuarial assumptions. our regulatory capital levels also may be affected in the future by changes to the applicable regulations, proposals for which are currently under consideration by both domestic and international insurance regulators. for additional information regarding the calculation of rbc and solvency margin ratios, as well as regulatory minimums, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
captive reinsurance companies we use captive reinsurance companies to more effectively manage our reserves and capital on an economic basis and to enable the aggregation and transfer of risks. our captive reinsurance companies assume business from affiliates only. to support the risks they assume, our captives are capitalized to a level we believe is consistent with the "aa" financial strength rating targets of our insurance subsidiaries. all of our captives are subject to internal policies governing their activities. in the normal course of business, we contribute capital to the captives to support business growth and other needs. prudential financial has also entered into support agreements with several of the captives in connection with financing arrangements. for a description of captive reinsurance company financing activities, see below under "-financing activities-subsidiary borrowings-term and universal life reserve financing."
table of contents shareholder distributions share repurchase program and shareholder dividends prudential financial's board of directors authorized the company to repurchase at management's discretion up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion of its outstanding common stock during the period from january 1, 2022 through december 31, 2022. we utilized the entirety of this $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization in 2022. in february 2023, the board authorized the company to repurchase, at management's discretion, up to $1 billion of its outstanding common stock during the period from january 1, 2023 through december 31, 2023.
in general, the timing and amount of share repurchases are determined by management based on market conditions and other considerations, including any increased capital needs of our businesses due to, among other things, credit migration and losses in our investment portfolio, changes in regulatory capital requirements and opportunities for growth and acquisitions. repurchases may be executed in the open market, through derivative, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1(c) under the securities exchange act of 1934.
the following table sets forth information about declarations of common stock dividends, as well as repurchases of shares of prudential financial's common stock, for each of the quarterly periods in 2022 and for the prior four years:
(in millions, except per share data)
(in millions, except per share data)
in addition, on february 7, 2023, prudential financial's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $1.25 per share of common stock, payable on march 16, 2023 to shareholders of record as of february 21, 2023.
liquidity liquidity management and stress testing are performed on a legal entity basis as the ability to transfer funds between subsidiaries is limited due in part to regulatory restrictions. liquidity needs are determined through daily and quarterly cash flow forecasting at the holding company and within our operating subsidiaries. we seek to maintain a minimum balance of highly liquid assets to ensure that adequate liquidity is available at prudential financial to cover fixed expenses in the event that we experience reduced cash flows from our operating subsidiaries at a time when access to capital markets is also not available.
we seek to mitigate the risk of having limited or no access to financing due to stressed market conditions by generally pre-funding debt in advance of maturity. we mitigate the refinancing risk associated with our debt that is used to fund operating needs by matching the term of debt with the assets financed. to ensure adequate liquidity in stress scenarios, stress testing is performed for our major operating subsidiaries. we seek to further mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining our access to alternative sources of liquidity, as discussed below.
liquidity of prudential financial the principal sources of funds available to prudential financial, the parent holding company, are dividends, returns of capital and loans from subsidiaries, and proceeds from debt issuances and certain stock-based compensation activity. these sources of funds may be supplemented by prudential financial's access to the capital markets as well as the "-alternative sources of liquidity" described below.
table of contents the primary uses of funds at prudential financial include servicing debt, making capital contributions and loans to subsidiaries, making acquisitions, paying declared shareholder dividends and repurchasing outstanding shares of common stock executed under authority from the board.
as of december 31, 2022, prudential financial had highly liquid assets with a carrying value totaling $5,413 million, an increase of $1,187 million from december 31, 2021. highly liquid assets predominantly include cash, short-term investments, u.s. treasury securities, obligations of other u.s. government authorities and agencies, and/or foreign government bonds. we maintain an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to optimize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between prudential financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis. excluding the net borrowings from this intercompany liquidity account, prudential financial had highly liquid assets of $4,535 million as of december 31, 2022, an increase of $982 million from december 31, 2021.

table of contents dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries. during 2022, prudential financial received dividends of $74 million from prudential annuities holding company. in addition to paying common stock dividends, our domestic insurance operations may return capital to prudential financial by other means, such as affiliated lending, and reinsurance with bermuda-based affiliates.
international insurance subsidiaries. during 2022, prudential financial received dividends of $1,313 million from its international insurance subsidiaries. in addition to paying common stock dividends, our international insurance operations may return capital to prudential financial through or facilitated by other means, such as the repayment of preferred stock obligations held by prudential financial or other affiliates, affiliated lending, affiliated derivatives and reinsurance with u.s.- and bermuda-based affiliates.
other subsidiaries. during 2022, prudential financial received dividends and returns of capital of $156 million from pgim subsidiaries and dividends of $41 million from other subsidiaries.
restriction on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries. our insurance companies are subject to limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to prudential financial and other affiliates under applicable insurance law and regulation. further, market conditions could negatively impact capital positions of our insurance companies, which could further restrict their ability to pay dividends. more generally, the payment of dividends by any of our subsidiaries is subject to declaration by their board of directors and can be affected by market conditions and other factors.
with respect to our domestic insurance subsidiaries, pica is permitted to pay ordinary dividends based on calculations specified under new jersey insurance law, subject to prior notification to the new jersey department of banking and insurance ("njdobi"). any distributions above this amount in any twelve-month period are considered to be "extraordinary" dividends, and the approval of the njdobi is required prior to payment. the laws regulating dividends of the states where our other domestic insurance companies are domiciled are similar, but not identical, to those of new jersey.
capital redeployment from our international insurance subsidiaries is subject to local regulatory requirements in the international jurisdictions in which they operate. our most significant international insurance subsidiaries, prudential of japan and gibraltar life, are permitted to pay common stock dividends based on calculations specified by japanese insurance law, subject to prior notification to the fsa. dividends in excess of these amounts and other forms of capital distribution require the prior approval of the fsa. the regulatory fiscal year end for both prudential of japan and gibraltar life is march 31, 2023, after which time the common stock dividend amount permitted to be paid without prior approval from the fsa can be determined.
the ability of our pgim subsidiaries and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries to pay dividends is largely unrestricted from a regulatory standpoint.
see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding specific dividend restrictions.
liquidity of insurance subsidiaries we manage the liquidity of our insurance operations to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. liquidity within each of our insurance subsidiaries is provided by a variety of sources, including portfolios of liquid assets. the investment portfolios of our subsidiaries are integral to the overall liquidity of our insurance operations. we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset/liability management approach specific to the requirements of each of our product lines. this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity, as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles, of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities.
liquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our insurance operations' liquidity under various stress scenarios, including company-specific and market-wide events. we continue to believe that cash generated by ongoing operations and the profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios for each of our insurance subsidiaries.
cash flow the principal sources of liquidity for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums, investment and fee income, investment maturities, sales of investments, and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations, as well as internal and external borrowings. the principal uses of liquidity include benefits, claims and dividends paid to policyholders, and payments to table of contents policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. other uses of liquidity may include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, the payment of dividends to the parent holding company, hedging and reinsurance activity and payments in connection with financing activities.
in each of our major insurance subsidiaries, we believe that the cash flows from operations are adequate to satisfy current liquidity requirements. the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions, changes in interest rate levels, policyholder perceptions of our financial strength, policyholder behavior, catastrophic events and the relative safety and attractiveness of competing products, each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows. our insurance operations' cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income, net of amounts reinvested. the primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers, our counterparties' willingness to extend repurchase and/or securities lending arrangements, commitments to invest and market volatility. we closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position.
domestic insurance operations. in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers. the following table sets forth the liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' account balances of certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries as of the dates indicated:
total future policy benefits and policyholders' account balances(2)(3)           $260.4                      $243.4
(3)excludes "liabilities held-for-sale" of $28.3 billion and $16.3 billion for priac and palac, respectively, as of december 31, 2021. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the liabilities presented above are primarily supported by invested assets in our general account. as noted above, when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions. as a result, assets will include both liquid assets, as discussed below, and other assets that we believe adequately support our liabilities.
for pica and other subsidiaries, the liabilities presented above primarily include annuity reserves and deposit liabilities and individual life insurance policy reserves. individual life insurance policies may impose surrender charges and policyholders may be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy. pica's reserves for group annuity contracts primarily relate to pension risk transfer contracts, which are generally not subject to early withdrawal. for our individual annuity contracts, to encourage persistency, most of our variable and fixed annuities have surrender or withdrawal charges for a specified number of years. in addition, certain fixed annuities impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity. the living benefit features of our variable annuities also encourage persistency because the potential value of the living benefit is fully realized only if the contract persists.
gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations' products in 2022 were generally consistent with our assumptions in asset/liability management, and the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity.
international insurance operations. as with our domestic operations, in managing the liquidity of our international insurance operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. the following table sets forth the liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholders' account balances of certain of our international insurance subsidiaries as of the dates indicated:
total future policy benefits and policyholders' account balances(4)           $159.7                      $169.1
(1)as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, $22.6 billion and $21.0 billion, respectively, of the insurance-related liabilities for prudential of japan are associated with u.s. dollar-denominated products that are coinsured to our domestic insurance operations and supported by u.s. dollar-denominated assets. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of the insurance-related liabilities for prudential of japan are primarily associated with yen- and u.s. dollar-denominated products that are coinsured to gibraltar re, a bermuda-based reinsurance affiliate, and primarily supported by yen- and u.s. dollar-denominated assets.
(2)includes pgfl. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, $7.9 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively, of the insurance-related liabilities for pgfl are associated with u.s. dollar-denominated products that are coinsured to our domestic insurance operations and supported by u.s. dollar-denominated assets. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, $10.8 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, of the insurance-related liabilities for gibraltar life are primarily associated with yen- and u.s. dollar-denominated products that are coinsured to gibraltar re and primarily supported by yen- and u.s. dollar-denominated assets.
the liabilities presented above are primarily supported by invested assets in our general account. when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions. as a result, assets will include both liquid assets, as discussed below, and other assets that we believe adequately support our liabilities.
we believe most of the longer-term recurring pay individual life insurance policies sold by our japanese operations do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process to obtain a new insurance policy.
prudential of japan and gibraltar life sell u.s. dollar denominated investment contracts with a market value adjustment feature to mitigate the profitability impact for surrenders, as these contracts may be subject to increased surrenders should the yen depreciate or if interest rates in the u.s. decline relative to japan. as of december 31, 2022, products with a market value adjustment feature represented $25.2 billion of our japan operations' insurance-related liabilities.
liquid assets liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, u.s. treasury securities, fixed maturities that are not designated as held-to-maturity and public equity securities. in addition to access to substantial investment portfolios, our insurance companies' liquidity is managed through access to a variety of instruments available for funding and/or managing cash flow mismatches, including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections. our ability to utilize assets and liquidity between our subsidiaries is limited by regulatory and other constraints. we believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios for each of our insurance subsidiaries.
the following table sets forth the fair value of certain of our domestic insurance operations' portfolio of liquid assets, as of the dates indicated.

given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios, we believe that claim experience, including policyholder withdrawals and surrenders, varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk. our alm process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities. to the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections, we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims, which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses, including from changes in interest rates or credit spreads. the payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities, in our financial statements. historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims.
liquidity associated with other activities hedging activities associated with individual retirement strategies for the portion of our individual retirement strategies' alm strategy executed through hedging, as well as the capital hedge program, we enter into a range of exchange-traded, cleared and other otc equity and interest rate derivatives in order to hedge certain capital market risks related to more severe market conditions. for a full discussion of our individual retirement strategies' risk management strategy, see "-results of operations by segment-u.s. businesses-retirement strategies." this portion of our individual retirement strategies' alm strategy and capital hedge program requires access to liquidity to meet payment obligations relating to these derivatives, such as payments for periodic settlements, purchases, maturities and terminations. these liquidity needs can vary materially due to, among other items, changes in interest rates, equity markets, mortality and policyholder behavior.
the hedging portion of our individual retirement strategies' alm strategy and capital hedge program may also result in derivative related collateral postings to (when we are in a net post position) or from (when we are in a net receive position) counterparties. the net collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the amount of the exposures hedged. depending on market conditions, the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs when we are in a net post position. as of december 31, 2022, the derivatives comprising the hedging portion of our individual retirement strategies' alm strategy and capital hedge program were in a net post position of $10.8 billion compared to a net post position of $5.5 billion as of december 31, 2021. the change in collateral position was primarily driven by the impact of increasing interest rates partially offset by equity market depreciation.
table of contents foreign exchange hedging activities we employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements, particularly those associated with the yen. our overall yen hedging strategy calibrates the hedge level to preserve the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the company's overall return on equity on a leverage neutral basis. the hedging strategy includes two primary components:
income hedges-we hedge a portion of our prospective yen-based earnings streams by entering into external forward currency derivative contracts that effectively fix the currency exchange rates for that portion of earnings, thereby reducing volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements.
equity hedges-we hold both internal and external hedges primarily to hedge our usd-equivalent equity. these hedges also mitigate volatility in the solvency margins of yen-based subsidiaries resulting from changes in the market value of their usd-denominated investments hedging our usd-equivalent equity attributable to changes in the yen-usd exchange rate.
for additional information regarding our hedging strategy, see "-results of operations-impact of foreign currency exchange rates."
cash settlements from these hedging activities result in cash flows between subsidiaries of prudential financial and either international-based subsidiaries or external parties. the cash flows are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged. for example, a significant yen depreciation over an extended period of time could result in net cash inflows, while a significant yen appreciation could result in net cash outflows. the following tables set forth information about net cash settlements and the net asset or liability resulting from these hedging activities related to the yen and other currencies for the periods indicated.

table of contents pgim operations the principal sources of liquidity for our fee-based pgim businesses include asset management fees, commercial mortgage origination and servicing fees, and internal and external funding facilities. the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses, facilitating our commercial mortgage loan business, and distributions of dividends and returns of capital to prudential financial. the primary liquidity risks for our fee-based pgim businesses relate to their profitability, which is impacted by market conditions, our investment management performance and client redemptions. we believe the cash flows from our fee-based pgim businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations, as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios, which are monitored through the use of internal measures.
the principal sources of liquidity for our seed and co-investments held in our pgim businesses are cash flows from investments, borrowing lines from internal sources, including prudential financial and prudential funding, llc ("prudential funding"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of pica, and external sources, including pgim's limited-recourse credit facility. the principal uses of liquidity for our seed and co-investments include making investments to support business growth and paying interest expense from the internal and external borrowings used to fund those investments. the primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner, declines in the value of assets and credit defaults.
alternative sources of liquidity in addition to asset-based financing as discussed below, prudential financial and certain subsidiaries have access to other sources of liquidity, including syndicated, unsecured committed credit facilities, membership in the federal home loan bank of new york, commercial paper programs, and contingent financing facilities in the form of a put option agreement and facility agreement. for additional information regarding these sources of liquidity, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
asset-based financing we conduct asset-based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries, including transactions such as securities lending, repurchase agreements and mortgage dollar rolls, to earn spread income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate trading activity. these programs are primarily driven by portfolio holdings of securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace. the collateral received in connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short-term spread portfolios of our insurance entities. investments held in the short-term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (primarily corporate bonds), mortgage loans and fixed maturities (primarily collateralized loan obligations and other structured securities), with a weighted average life at time of purchase by the short-term portfolios of four years or less. floating rate assets comprise the majority of our short-term spread portfolio. these short-term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements, which among other things, do not allow for significant asset/liability interest rate duration mismatch.
the following table sets forth our liabilities under asset-based or secured financing programs as of the dates indicated:

as of december 31, 2022, our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the asset-based or secured financing programs of $83.2 billion, of which $12.4 billion were on loan. taking into account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of december 31, 2022, we believe approximately $9.8 billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable, including approximately $7.9 billion relating to pfi excluding the closed block division, of which $1.9 billion relates to certain separate accounts and may only be used for financing activities related to those accounts, and the remaining $1.9 billion relating to the closed block division.
financing activities as of december 31, 2022, total short-term and long-term debt of the company on a consolidated basis was $20.7 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion from december 31, 2021. the following table sets forth total consolidated borrowings of the company as of the dates indicated. we may, from time to time, seek to redeem or repurchase our outstanding debt securities through open market purchases, individually negotiated transactions or otherwise. any such actions will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity position and other factors.

(1)amounts are net of assets under set-off arrangements of $12,290 million and $10,691 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(2)limited and non-recourse borrowing primarily represents mortgage debt of our subsidiaries that has recourse only to real estate investment property of $208 million and $274 million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and a draw on a credit facility with recourse only to collateral pledged by the company of $300 million as of both december 31, 2022 and 2021.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to the borrowings in the table above. for additional information regarding our short- and long-term debt obligations, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
based on the use of proceeds, we classify our borrowings as capital debt and operating debt. capital debt, which is debt utilized to meet the capital requirements of our businesses, was $14.1 billion and $12.7 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. operating debt was $6.1 billion as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, and is utilized for business funding to meet specific purposes, which may include activities associated with our pgim and assurance iq businesses. operating debt also consists of debt issued to finance specific portfolios of investment assets, the proceeds from which will service the debt. specifically, this includes assets supporting reserve requirements under regulation xxx and guideline axxx as described below, as well as funding for institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences.
table of contents prudential financial borrowings long-term borrowings are conducted primarily by prudential financial. it borrows these funds to meet its capital and other funding needs, as well as the capital and funding needs of its subsidiaries. prudential financial maintains a shelf registration statement with the sec that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid securities. as a "well-known seasoned issuer" under sec rules, prudential financial's shelf registration statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity.
prudential financial's borrowings increased $1.5 billion from december 31, 2021, primarily driven by $2.5 billion in junior subordinated notes issuances, offset by $1.0 billion in debt redemptions. in february, 2022, the company issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.125% junior subordinated notes due in march 2052. in august 2022, the company issued $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.95% junior subordinated notes due in september 2052 and $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% junior subordinated notes due in september 2062. in september, 2022, the company redeemed, in full, $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% junior subordinated notes due in 2042. for additional information regarding long-term debt, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
subsidiary borrowings subsidiary borrowings principally consist of commercial paper borrowings by prudential funding, asset-based financing and real estate investment financing. borrowings of our subsidiaries decreased $150 million from december 31, 2021, due primarily to debt maturities of $98 million in other short-term debt and a $64 million decrease in limited and non-recourse borrowings.
term and universal life reserve financing for business written prior to the implementation of principle-based reserving, regulation xxx and guideline axxx require domestic life insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life policies with similar guarantees. many market participants believe that these levels of reserves are excessive relative to the levels reasonably required to maintain solvency for moderately adverse experience. the difference between the statutory reserve and the amount necessary to maintain solvency for moderately adverse experience is considered to be the non-economic portion of the statutory reserve.
we use captive reinsurance subsidiaries to finance the portion of the statutory reserves required to be held by our domestic life insurance companies under regulation xxx and guideline axxx that we consider to be non-economic. the financing arrangements involve the reinsurance of term and universal life business to our captive reinsurers and the issuance of surplus notes by those captives that are treated as capital for statutory purposes. these surplus notes are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of principal and interest on the surplus notes can only be made with prior insurance regulatory approval.
we have entered into agreements with external counterparties providing for the issuance of surplus notes by our captive reinsurers in return for the receipt of credit-linked notes ("credit-linked note structures"). under the agreements, the captive receives in exchange for the surplus notes one or more credit-linked notes issued by a special-purpose affiliate of the company with an aggregate principal amount equal to the surplus notes outstanding. the captive holds the credit-linked notes as assets supporting regulation xxx or guideline axxx non-economic reserves, as applicable. the captive can redeem the principal amount of the outstanding credit-linked notes for cash upon the occurrence of, and in an amount necessary to remedy, a specified liquidity stress event affecting the captive. under the agreements, the external counterparties have agreed to fund any such payments under the credit-linked notes in return for the receipt of fees. under certain of the transactions, prudential financial has agreed to make capital contributions to the captive to reimburse it for investment losses in excess of specified amounts and/or has agreed to reimburse the external counterparties for any payments made under the credit-linked notes. to date, no such payments under the credit-linked notes have been required. under these transactions, because valid rights of set-off exist, interest and principal payments on the surplus notes and on the credit-linked notes are settled on a net basis, and the surplus notes are reflected in the company's total consolidated borrowings on a net basis.
as of december 31, 2022, we had credit-linked note structures with an aggregate issuance capacity of $16,050 million, of which $14,070 million was outstanding, as compared to an aggregate issuance capacity of $14,600 million, of which $12,721 million was outstanding, as of december 31, 2021. these amounts reflect a credit link note structure for guideline axxx reserves that was expanded in december 2022, of which $2,100 million was outstanding as of december 31, 2022.
table of contents the following table summarizes our credit-linked note structures, which are reported on a net basis, as of december 31, 2022:

(1)prudential financial has agreed to reimburse amounts paid under the credit-linked notes issued in this structure up to $500 million.
(2)the $2,080 million of surplus notes represents an intercompany transaction that eliminates upon consolidation. prudential financial has agreed to reimburse amounts paid under credit-linked notes issued in this structure up to $1,000 million.
as of december 31, 2022, we also had outstanding an aggregate of $3,025 million of debt issued for the purpose of financing $925 million of regulation xxx and $2,100 million of guideline axxx non-economic reserves. in addition, as of december 31, 2022, for purposes of financing guideline axxx non-economic reserves, one captive had $3,982 million of surplus notes outstanding that were issued to affiliates.
the company has introduced updated versions of its individual life products in conjunction with the requirement to adopt principle-based reserving by january 1, 2020. these updated products are currently priced to support the principle-based statutory reserve level without the need for reserve financing.
contractual obligations the table below summarizes the future estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of december 31, 2022. the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations. because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary, possibly materially, from those reflected in the table. in addition, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations, as the table below does not contemplate all aspects of our cash inflows, such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments, nor all aspects of our cash outflows.

(1)the estimated payments due by period for long-term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal, as disclosed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as estimated future interest payments. the payment of principal and estimated future interest for short-term debt are reflected in estimated payments due in 2023. the estimate for future interest payments includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our short-term and long-term debt.
(2)the estimated payments due by period for operating leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases, as disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)as discussed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, we have commitments to purchase or fund investments, some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control, including those at the discretion of our counterparties. the timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated, therefore the settlements of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year. commitments to purchase or fund investments include $183 million that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts.
(4)as discussed in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements, loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations, which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty, have been reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment; however, it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration date. in certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee.
(5)the estimated cash flows due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits, policyholders' account balances, policyholder's dividends, reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities, net of premium receipts and reinsurance recoverables. contractual obligations are contingent upon the receipt of premiums. these future estimated cash flows for current policies in force generally reflect our best estimate economic and actuarial assumptions. these cash flows are undiscounted with respect to interest. therefore, the sum of the cash flows shown for all years in the table of $949 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of approximately $622 billion included in the consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2022. separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations, and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash flows. we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash flows related to the underlying policies and contracts. due to the significance of the assumptions used and the contingent nature of contractual terms, actual cash flows and their timing will differ, possibly materially, from these estimates. timing of cash flows in the "2028 and thereafter" category include long term liabilities that may extend beyond 100 years.
(6)the estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase, cash collateral for loaned securities, liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, bank customer liabilities, and other miscellaneous liabilities. amounts presented in the table also exclude $374 million of notes issued by consolidated vie's which recourse for these obligations is limited to the assets of the respective vie and do not have recourse to the general credit of the company.
we also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of december 31, 2022.
off-balance sheet arrangements see additional information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements in note 17 and other commitments in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements.
we do not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions, arrangements or relationships that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support, that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources. in addition, we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to associated assets.
ratings financial strength ratings (which are sometimes referred to as "claims-paying" ratings) and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products. our credit ratings are also important for our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing. nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations continually review the financial performance and financial condition of the entities they rate, including prudential financial and its rated subsidiaries.
a downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of prudential financial or its rated subsidiaries could potentially, among other things, limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals, increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds, adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees, such as letters of credit, cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and/or hurt our relationships with creditors, distributors, or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability, liquidity, and/or capital. in addition, we consider our own risk of non-performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities. therefore, changes in our credit or financial strength ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities.
financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity's ability to repay its indebtedness. the following table summarizes the ratings for prudential financial and certain of its subsidiaries as of the date of this filing:

(1)a.m. best company, which we refer to as a.m. best, financial strength ratings for insurance companies range from "a++ (superior)" to "d (poor)". a rating of a+ is the second highest of thirteen rating categories. a.m. best long-term credit ratings range from "aaa (exceptional)" to "c (poor)". a.m. best short-term credit ratings range from "amb-1+", which represents the strongest ability to repay short-term debt obligations, to "amb-4 (questionable)".
(2)standard & poor's rating services, which we refer to as s&p, financial strength ratings for insurance companies range from "aaa (extremely strong)" to "d (default)". a rating of aa- is the fourth highest of twenty-two rating categories. s&p's long-term issue credit ratings range from "aaa (extremely strong)" to "d (default)". s&p short-term ratings range from "a-1 (extremely strong)" to "d (default)".
(3)moody's investors service, inc., which we refer to as moody's, insurance financial strength ratings range from "aaa (highest quality)" to "c (lowest)". a rating of aa3 is the fourth highest of twenty-one rating categories. numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group-with 1 being the highest and 3 being the lowest. these modifiers are used to indicate relative strength within a category. moody's long-term credit ratings range from "aaa (highest)" to "c (default)". moody's short-term ratings range from "prime-1 (p-1)", which represents a superior ability for repayment of short-term debt obligations, to "prime-3 (p-3)", which represents an acceptable ability for repayment of such obligations. issuers rated "not prime" do not fall within any of the prime rating categories.
(4)fitch ratings inc., which we refer to as fitch, financial strength ratings range from "aaa (exceptionally strong)" to "c (distressed)". a rating of aa- is the fourth highest of twenty-one rating categories. fitch long-term credit ratings range from "aaa (highest credit quality)", which denotes exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, to "d (default)". short-term ratings range from "f1+ (highest credit quality)" to "d (default)".
the ratings set forth above reflect current opinions of each rating agency. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. these ratings are not directed toward shareholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the common stock. these ratings are reviewed periodically and may be changed at any time by the rating agencies. as a result, we cannot assure stakeholders that we will maintain our current ratings in the future.
rating agencies use an "outlook" statement for both industry sectors and individual companies. for an industry sector, a stable outlook generally implies that over the next 12 to 18 months the rating agency expects ratings to remain unchanged among companies in the sector. am best, fitch, s&p, and moody's currently have a stable outlook on the u.s. life insurance sector.
for a particular company, an outlook generally indicates a medium- or long-term trend (generally six months to two years) in credit fundamentals, which if continued, may lead to a rating change. these indicators are not necessarily a precursor of a rating change nor do they preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice. a.m. best, fitch, s&p and moody's currently have the company's ratings on stable outlook.
requirements to post collateral or make other payments because of ratings downgrades under certain agreements, including derivative agreements, can be satisfied in cash or by posting permissible securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. in addition, a ratings downgrade by a.m. best to "a-" for our domestic life insurance companies would require pica to either post collateral or a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $1.2 billion, based on the level of statutory table of contents reserves related to the variable annuity business acquired from allstate. we believe that the posting of such collateral would not be a material liquidity event for pica.
risk management overview we employ a risk governance structure, overseen by senior management and our board and managed by enterprise risk management ("erm"), to provide a common framework for: evaluating the risks embedded in and across our businesses and corporate centers; developing risk appetites; managing these risks; and identifying current and future risk challenges and opportunities. for a discussion of the risks of our businesses, see "risk factors".
risk governance framework each of our businesses has a risk governance structure that is supported by a framework at the corporate level. generally, our businesses are authorized to make day-to-day risk decisions that are consistent with enterprise risk policies and limits, and subject to enterprise oversight.
board of directors oversight our board oversees our risk profile and management's processes for assessing and managing risk, through both the whole board and its committees. the board also reviews strategic risks and opportunities facing the company and its businesses. other important categories of risk are assigned to designated board committees that report back to the full board. in general, the committees oversee the following risks:
•audit committee: insurance risk and operational risk, including model risk, as well as risks related to financial controls, legal, regulatory, cyber security and compliance risk;
•compensation committee: the design and operation of the company's compensation programs so that they do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking;
•corporate governance and business ethics committee: the company's overall ethical culture, political contributions, lobbying expenses and overall political strategy, as well as the company's environmental risk (which includes climate risk), sustainability and corporate social responsibility to minimize reputational risk and focus on future sustainability;
•finance committee: liquidity risk and risk involving our capital and liquidity management, the incurrence and repayment of borrowings, the capital structure of the company, funding of benefit plans and statutory insurance reserves. the finance committee oversees our capital plan and receives regular updates on the sources and uses of capital relative to plan, as well as on our risk appetite framework;
•investment committee: investment risk, market risk, and review of investment performance and risk positions. the investment committee approves investment and market risk limits based on asset class, issuer, credit quality and geography; and
•risk committee: the governance of significant risk throughout the company, the establishment and ongoing monitoring of our risk profile, risk capacity and risk appetite, and coordination of the risk oversight functions of the other board committees.
management oversight our primary risk management committee is the enterprise risk committee ("erc"). the erc is chaired by our chief risk officer and otherwise consists of the vice chairman, head of u.s. businesses, head of international businesses and pgim, general counsel, chief financial officer, chief investment officer, chief information officer and chief actuary. our chief auditor also attends meetings of the erc. the erc oversees the company's risk management framework, including the identification, assessment, monitoring and management of risks and how those risks align with the company's loss absorption resources. the primary focus of the erc is the critical analysis of significant quantitative and qualitative risks and the appropriateness and alignment to the defined risk appetite of the company.
the erc is supported by five risk oversight committees, each of which consists of subject matter experts and is dedicated to one of the following risk types: investment, market (including liquidity), insurance, operational, and model. significant matters or matters where there are unresolved points of view are reviewed by the erc. the risk oversight committees provide an opportunity for subject matter experts within the various risk areas to evaluate complex issues. they evaluate the effectiveness of risk mitigation options, identify stakeholders of risks and issues, review material assumptions for reasonability and consistency across the company, and develop recommendations for risk limits, among other responsibilities.
table of contents in addition, each of our businesses and certain corporate centers maintain their own risk committee as a forum for leaders to identify, assess, and monitor risk and exposure issues and to review new business activities and initiatives.
enterprise risk management oversight erm manages the risk management framework. the function operates independently and is responsible for recommending policies, limits and standards for all risks. erm oversees these risks under the guidance of the erc and risk oversight committees. additionally, erm along with our business unit chief risk officers and heads of operational risk management work with our businesses and corporate areas to identify, monitor and manage risks. the erm infrastructure is generally aligned by risk type, with certain groups within erm working across risk types.
risk identification we rely on a combination of activities to ensure that all material risks have been identified and managed as appropriate. there are three levels of activities that seek to ensure that changes in risk levels or new risks to the company are identified and escalated as appropriate: (1) business activities, (2) corporate center activities, and (3) processes involving senior management and the board.
•business activities: each business area has a risk committee that allows senior leaders to discuss and evaluate current, new, and emerging risks in their own operations. businesses are required to develop and maintain documented risk inventories that facilitate the identification of current risk exposures.
•corporate center activities: the corporate centers review the results of the business activities and examine risks from an enterprise view across businesses under normal and stressed conditions. as a result, the corporate centers, particularly erm, use several processes and activities to identify and assess the risks of the company. most corporate centers have their own risk committees.
•senior management and the board: senior management plays a critical role in reviewing the risk profile of the company, including identifying impacts to the business strategy and risks in any new strategies under consideration. these risks are discussed with the erc as appropriate, and with the board if significant. as discussed above, the board oversees the company's risk profile and management's processes for assessing and managing risk, both as a full board and through its committees.
risk measurement and monitoring our risk appetite framework is a comprehensive process designed to reasonably ensure that risks taken across the company align with the company's capacity and willingness to take those risks. using the risk appetite framework, the company measures, evaluates, and manages its financial risks. the comprehensive models, metrics, and stress scenarios used enable the company to understand its current risk profile as well as how the risk profile may change over time through varying degrees of stress. the risk appetite framework anchors the risk and capital management processes and supports management and the board in making well-informed business decisions..
the risk appetite framework is centered around a comprehensive and cohesive stress testing regime which includes a variety of stress scenarios designed to explore outcomes across the investment portfolios and businesses. this robust stress testing examines the sensitivity of assets and liabilities and how they interact with each other through time to identify places where the company's capacity may be challenged by the risks taken. these analytics provide insight into the impact of stress scenarios on capital and liquidity.
additionally, the qualitative risk appetite framework helps the company understand and manage risks that are not easily quantifiable. by continuously scanning the internal environment and reporting findings to leadership and the board on a regular basis, the company can monitor and mitigate operational risks in qualitative areas, such as: culture; reputation; compliance with laws, regulations, and policies; and decision-making incentives.
our risk management framework incorporates severe to very severe stresses across equities, interest rates, credit migration and defaults, currencies and mortality. this framework includes a specific "pandemic and sell-off" scenario with a mortality calamity (1.5 extra deaths per 1,000 lives in the first year) based on a modern-day interpretation of the 1918 spanish flu experience that is aligned with most regulatory frameworks. as covid-19 transitions to an endemic state, we continue to table of contents update our analysis and take management actions in response to this specific event. the impacts of this scenario on our key metrics are assessed periodically.
as of december 31, 2022, the covid-19 pandemic has not reached the most severe levels of financial impacts included in the company's stress testing. in addition, the net mortality impact of covid-19 has been moderated by the balance between our mortality exposure (such as in our individual life and group insurance businesses) and our offsetting longevity exposure (such as in the institutional portion of our retirement strategies business) and is influenced by the age distribution of covid-19 mortality. the future evolution of the virus, among other factors, could cause the actual course of the pandemic to differ from our current expectations.

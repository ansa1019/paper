table of contents note 1. basis of presentation the accompanying condensed financial statements of edison international parent should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of edison international and subsidiaries ("registrant") included in this form 10-k. edison international parent's significant accounting policies are consistent with those of the registrant, sce and other wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries.
1.3billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. dividend restrictions cpuc holding company rules require that sce's dividend policy be established by sce's board of directors on the same basis as if sce were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of sce, as deemed to be necessary to meet sce's electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the boards of directors of both edison international and sce. in addition, the cpuc regulates sce's capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay to its shareholders. the common equity component of sce's cpuc authorized capital structure is 52% on a weighted average basis over the january 1, 2023 to december 31, 2025 compliance period. this is unchanged from the january 1, 2020
to december 31, 2022 compliance period. the cpuc authorized capital structure differs from the capital structure calculated based on gaap due to certain exclusions allowed by cpuc, including the impact of sce's contributions to the wildfire insurance fund under ab 1054. for further information, see "business-sce-overview of ratemaking process" and "business-southern california wildfires." in may 2020, the cpuc issued a decision on sce's application to the cpuc for waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement, that allows sce to exclude from its equity ratio calculations (i) net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events and (ii) debt issued for the purpose of paying claims related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events up to an amount equal to the net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events. with these exclusions, sce was in compliance with its authorized capital structure for the compliance period from january 1, 2020 to december 31,
2022. the temporary exclusion lapsed on may 7, 2022. in april 2022, sce filed another application requesting continued waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement. under the cpuc's rules, sce will not be deemed to be in violation of the equity ratio requirement while the waiver application is pending resolution. while the exclusion is in place, sce is required to notify the cpuc if an adverse financial event reduces sce's spot equity ratio by more than one percent from the level most recently filed with the cpuc in the proceeding. the last spot equity ratio sce filed with the cpuc in the proceeding did not exclude the then $ 1.8 billion net charge and was
45.2% as of december 31, 2018 (at the time the common equity component of sce's cpuc authorized capital structure was required to remain at or above 48% on a weighted average basis over the applicable 37-month period). sce's spot equity ratio on december 31, 2018 would have been 48.7% had the $ 1.8 billion net charge at december 31, 2018 been excluded, therefore sce will notify the cpuc if its spot ratio drops below 47.7% in any quarter. for further information, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides." note 2. debt and equity financing long-

table of contents edison international's earnings are prepared in accordance with gaap. management uses core earnings (losses)
internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. core earnings (losses) are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding edison international's earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company's performance from period to period. core earnings (losses) are a non-gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. core earnings (losses) are defined as earnings attributable to edison international shareholders less non-core items. non-core items include income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as write downs, asset impairments and other income and expense related to changes in law, outcomes in tax, regulatory or legal proceedings, and exit activities, including sale of certain assets and other activities that are no longer continuing. edison international's 2022 earnings decreased $147
million of higher core earnings, offset by $68 million of higher non-core losses. the increase in sce's core earnings was primarily due to higher revenue due to the escalation mechanism as set forth in the 2021 grc final decision and higher return on rate base from capital balancing accounts, partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, higher depreciation from increased plant balance and higher interest expense. the increase in edison international parent and other's core losses was primarily due to higher preferred dividends. consolidated non-core items for 2022 and 2021 for edison international included:
●  recorded in 2021 for 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events claims and expenses, net of expected recoveries from ferc customers. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies" for further information.
●  recorded in 2021 from the amortization of sce's contributions to the wildfire insurance fund. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies" for further information.

electricity industry trends the electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by federal and state government actions to reduce ghg emissions, as well as technological advances, such as customer-owned generation, electric vehicles and energy storage. these factors are altering the way in which electricity is generated and delivered as well as the regulatory and business environment for the industry. california is committed to reducing its ghg emissions, improving local air quality and supporting continued economic growth. the state codified into law goals to reduce ghg emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2030 and 85% from the same baseline by 2045, as well as to be carbon neutral by 2045. state and local air quality plans also call for substantial improvements. in the most polluted areas of the state this includes reducing smog-causing nitrogen oxides 90% below 2010 levels by 2032. while these policy goals cannot be achieved by the electric sector alone, the electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of energy technologies that support california's climate change and ghg reduction objectives. california has set rps targets which require california retail sellers of electricity to provide 60% of power from renewable resources by 2030. california also requires sellers of electricity to deliver 100% of retail sales from carbon-free sources by 2045, including interim targets of 90% by 2035 and 95% by
2040. in 2022, approximately 48% of sce's customer deliveries came from carbon-free resources. sce remains well-
positioned to meet its long-term rps and carbon-free power goals and interim targets. in addition, edison international is committed to achieving net-zero ghg emissions by 2045, in alignment with economy-wide climate actions planned by california. this commitment covers the power sce delivers to customers and edison international's enterprise-wide operations. the current federal administration has also responded to climate change through numerous regulatory and executive order actions including for the development of more robust fuel efficiency and vehicle emission standards. many of these actions align with internal company goals and efforts to address and mitigate climate change. additionally, building upon the historic infrastructure legislation of 2021, congress passed the ira in 2022 that provides significant new funding to electrify the economy. edison international believes these actions complement its industry-leading efforts to equitably transition to a decarbonized economy. edison international believes that california's 2045 goals can be achieved most economically through emissions reductions from using clean electricity to serve 100% of retail sales, electrifying approximately
76% of light-duty vehicles, 67% of medium-duty vehicles, 38% of heavy-duty vehicles, 85% of buses and 70% of buildings and using low-carbon fuels for technologies that are not yet viable for electrification. california has demonstrated strong long-term support of transportation electrification as shown by the approval of sce's charge ready programs and 2022 legislation
table of contents banning sales of new gas vehicles by 2035. however, sce believes that more state policy support, along with public and private investment, is needed to enable california to reach its 2030 ghg reduction targets.
to support these goals, edison international's vision is to lead the transformation of the electric power industry and the company is focused on opportunities in delivering clean energy, advancing electrification, building a modernized and more reliable grid, and enabling customers' technology choices. sce is focused on accelerating clean power and electrification, strengthening and modernizing the grid, achieving operational and service excellence and proactively mitigating climate change-related risks, including wildfires. sce's ongoing focus to drive operational and service excellence is intended to allow it to achieve these objectives safely while controlling costs and customer rates. sce projects that, even as electricity bills increase over time, due to higher efficiency of electrified end-use technologies, decarbonization and electrification will reduce energy consumption costs for the average family by one-third by 2045. sce's focus on the transmission and distribution of electricity aligns with california's policy supporting competitive power procurement markets.
sce is undertaking projects and programs to accelerate economy-wide electrification. to support system reliability, sce is investing $1.0 billion in utility owned storage capacity as well as contracting for substantial new clean energy resources. see "-capital program" and "business-sce-purchased power and fuel supply-caiso wholesale energy market" for further details. sce also continues to implement its transportation electrification programs. as of december 31, 2022, sce had completed construction at 179 sites to support 3,048 charge ports under its suite of light duty charge ready programs, and 42 sites to support the electrification of 895 medium and heavy-duty vehicles through its charge ready transport program.
changes in the electric power industry are impacting customers and jurisdictions outside california as well. many other states and countries are also pursuing climate change and ghg reduction objectives and large commercial and industrial customers are continuing to pursue cost reduction and sustainability goals. edison energy provides decarbonization and energy solutions to commercial, institutional and industrial customers in north america and europe who may be impacted by these changes.
to better engage in this broader transformation and provide a view of developments outside of sce, edison international has made several investments in emerging companies in areas related to the technology and business model changes that are driving industry transformation and may make additional investments in the future. these investments are not financially material to edison international.
2025 general rate case sce expects to file its 2025 grc application with the cpuc in may 2023, for the four-year period of 2025 - 2028. in its 2025 grc, sce will seek necessary funding for various grid planning and development activities to support california's clean energy transformation and economy-wide decarbonization objectives, while continuing to prioritize wildfire mitigation programs in high fire risk areas, focus on increased system reliability, technology enabled grid investments and provide safe, reliable, and affordable service to customers.
table of contents cost of capital applications in 2021, sce filed an application with the cpuc for authority to establish its authorized cost of capital for utility operations for 2022 and to reset the related annual cost of capital mechanism that can adjust the authorized cost of capital between sce's cost of capital proceedings based on changes in moody's utility bond rate index. in november 2022, the cpuc issued a decision maintaining sce's cost of capital at pre-2022 levels for 2022
and closing the proceedings. in december 2022, intervenors filed an application for rehearing of the decision; if the cpuc takes further action it may impact revenues collected in rates during 2022.
in april 2022, sce filed an application with the cpuc for authority to establish its authorized cost of capital for utility operations for a three-year term beginning in 2023 and to reset the related annual cost of capital adjustment mechanism (see "business-sce-overview of ratemaking process" for further information on the adjustment mechanism). in december 2022, the cpuc issued a final decision that set sce's roe at 10.05%, and maintained sce's current authorized capital structure, after cpuc-allowed exclusions, of 52% common equity, 43% long-term debt, and
5% preferred equity. under the final decision, sce's 2023 authorized cost of long-term debt and preferred equity are 4.39% and 6.50%, respectively. based on the approved capital structure and costs, sce's weighted average return on rate base for 2023 will be 7.44%. based on the revenue requirement approved in sce's 2021 grc, the final decision will decrease sce's revenue requirement for 2023 by approximately $90 million compared to the cost of capital currently in rates. in january an intervenor filed an application for rehearing, if the cpuc takes further action it may impact revenues being collected in rates during 2023.
the cost of capital adjustment mechanism's benchmark beginning january 1, 2023, is the 12-month, october 1, 2021
through september 30, 2022, average moody's baa utility bond yield of 4.37%. if the difference between the benchmark and the average of the same index for the 12-month period from october 1, 2022 to september 30, 2023
exceeds 100-basis points, sce's cpuc-authorized roe will be adjusted for 2024 by half the amount of the difference
(up or down). the average moody's baa utility bond yield between october 1, 2022 and february 16, 2023 was 5.78%.
the spot rate for moody's baa utility bond was 5.65% on february 16, 2023. an average moody's baa utility bond yield of 5.13% or higher from february 17, 2023 through september 30, 2023 would trigger the mechanism to adjust upward.
capital program total capital expenditures (including accruals) were $5.7 billion in 2022 and $5.4 billion in 2021. sce's year-end rate base was $40.6 billion at december 31, 2022, compared to $37.9 billion at december 31, 2021, after excluding rate base associated with ab 1054 excluded capital expenditures.
sce's 2022 recorded and 2023 - 2024 forecast capital expenditures are set forth in the table below:

* not applicable sce's capital expenditure forecast reflects planned cpuc-jurisdictional spending including amounts requested in sce's grc track 4 filing for the 2024 attrition year of the 2021 grc, the wccp and other programs outlined in sce's wmp that are above amounts authorized in the 2021 grc, cpuc-approved utility owned storage expenditures and planned ferc capital expenditures. see "liquidity and capital resources-sce-regulatory proceedings" for more information on the grc track 4 filing. potential capital spending variability associated with future regulatory requests based on management judgment, potential for permitting delays and other operational considerations is reflected in the range case above, including deferral of all activity on the riverside transmission reliability project during 2023. for more information, see "liquidity-sce-capital investment plan."
the completion of projects, the timing of expenditures, and the associated cost recovery may be affected by permitting requirements and delays, construction schedules, availability of labor, equipment and materials, financing, legal and regulatory approvals and developments, community requests or protests, weather and other unforeseen conditions. in addition to the amounts presented in the table above sce expects to make additional cpuc capital expenditures, the recovery of which will be subject to future regulatory approval. this includes expenditures to be requested in the 2025 grc application which will reflect sce's 2023 - 2025 wmp and non-grc programs including the building electrification program and an enterprise resource planning software implementation. these capital expenditures and expected ferc capital expenditures are expected to be in a range of approximately $5.3 billion to $6.8 billion in aggregate between 2024 and 2025. reflected below is sce's weighted average annual rate base for 2023 - 2024 incorporating authorized cpuc-jurisdictional expenditures including utility owned storage, planned ferc capital expenditures, and planned non-grc projects or programs.

* not applicable including programs outlined in sce's wmp subject to future cost recovery proceedings, rate base associated with wildfire restoration capital expenditures subject to future cema applications and planned expenditures from the 2025 grc and non-grc programs, sce's weighted average annual rate base could be up to $45.0
table of contents utility owned storage projects in october 2021, sce contracted with ameresco, inc. ("ameresco") for the construction of utility owned energy storage projects at three sites in sce's service territory with an aggregate capacity of 537.5 mw and an in-service date of august 1, 2022.
in april 2022, sce received a force majeure event notice from ameresco in which ameresco asserted that both manufacturing delays related to covid-19 shut-downs in china and new shipping restrictions imposed by chinese governmental authorities were then impacting the supply of batteries from china necessary for timely completion of the projects. ameresco subsequently supplemented its force majeure notice noting additional supply chain issues related to covid-19. permitting delays and engineering issues and certain changes requested by sce also impacted the projects in 2022. sce expects to receive in aggregate approximately $270 million of tax credits available under the ira for all three projects, which will accrue to the benefit of its customers. in january 2023, sce received a force majeure event notice from ameresco in which ameresco asserted that severe winter storms in southern california had impacted the timely completion of the projects.
while ameresco has advised sce that it currently expects all three projects to be in-service prior to june 2023, sce believes that there is risk of delay beyond ameresco's projected in-service dates.
sce is continuing to evaluate the force majeure event notices and is awaiting additional information from ameresco on the underlying events. if there is a valid force majeure event under the contracts with ameresco, subject to certain conditions, the project schedules and any related triggers of liquidated damages may be extended, and the contract prices may be increased to account for the impact of the force majeure event. because ameresco did not achieve an in-service date of august 1, 2022, sce is entitled to liquidated damages under the terms of the contracts subject to any relief ameresco may be entitled to under the contracts, including any relief for any valid force majeure events. once triggered, liquidated damages accrue daily for up to 60 days up to a maximum of $89
million in aggregate for all three projects.
subject to reductions for any liquidated damages sce is paid, sce currently expects these storage projects to result in $1.0 billion of capital expenditures. in december 2021, the cpuc approved recovery of these expenditures and establishment of a balancing account for the associated revenue requirement, which have been reflected in rates beginning in the first quarter of 2022. authorized revenue requirements will be included in the annual erra review proceeding and can only be disallowed upon a finding that sce failed to prudently administer the contracts.
southern california wildfires and mudslides california has experienced unprecedented weather conditions in recent years due to climate change. the worsening weather and fuel conditions across california increase the likelihood of wildfires, including those where sce's equipment may be alleged to be associated with the fire's ignition, and sce's service territory remains susceptible to additional wildfire activity in 2023 and beyond. in response to worsening conditions and increased wildfire activity over the past several years, sce has developed and is implementing its wmp to reduce the risk of sce equipment contributing to the ignition of wildfires. in addition, california has increased its investment in wildfire prevention and fire suppression capabilities. in addition to the investments sce is making as part of its wmp, sce also uses its psps program to proactively de-energize power lines as a last resort to mitigate the risk of significant wildfires during extreme weather events.
wildfires in sce's territory in december 2017 and november 2018 caused loss of life, substantial damage to both residential and business properties, and service outages for sce customers. sce has incurred material losses in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events.
table of contents sce's equipment has been, and may further be, alleged to be associated with several wildfires that have originated in southern california subsequent to 2018. edison international and sce expect that any losses incurred in connection with those fires will be covered by insurance, subject to self-insured retentions and co-insurance, recoveries through electric rates or third-party receivables, and expect that any such losses after recoveries will not be material.
2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events multiple lawsuits and investigations related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events have been initiated against sce and edison international. as of december 31, 2022, in addition to the local public entity settlement, the tkm subrogation settlement and the woolsey subrogation settlement, sce had entered into settlements with approximately
9,500 individual plaintiffs in the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events litigation. in addition, sce and the sed executed the sed agreement in october 2021, and sce's obligations under the sed agreement commenced on august 15,
in 2022, sce accrued estimated losses of $1.3 billion for the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events. as a result, sce also recorded expected recoveries through ferc electric rates of $76 million against the charge, and the resulting net charge to earnings was $1.2 billion ($879 million after-tax).
after giving effect to all payment obligations under settlements entered into through december 31, 2022, including under the sed agreement, edison international's and sce's best estimate of expected losses for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events was $934 million. as of the same date, sce had assets for expected recoveries through ferc electric rates of $142 million on their consolidated balance sheets and had exhausted expected insurance recoveries related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events. edison international and sce may incur a material loss in excess of amounts accrued in connection with the remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events.
sce will seek cpuc-jurisdictional rate recovery of prudently-incurred losses and related costs realized in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events in excess of available insurance and ferc-jurisdictional recoveries, other than for any obligations under the sed agreement. based on edison international's and sce's current best estimate of expected losses for the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, sce currently expects to seek cpuc-jurisdictional rate recovery of approximately $6 billion by filing multiple future applications with the cpuc.
sce targets the third quarter of 2023 for the first of such cost recovery applications, and expects to request recovery of approximately $2 billion in that filing. sce's plans with respect to these filings may be delayed or modified. for example, the filings may be delayed if proceedings related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events do not progress as anticipated. sce believes that, in light of the cpuc's decision in a cost recovery proceeding involving sdg&e arising from several 2007 wildfires in sdg&e's service area, there is substantial uncertainty regarding how the cpuc will interpret and apply its prudency standard to an investor-owned utility in wildfire cost-recovery proceedings for fires ignited prior to the adoption of ab 1054 on july 12, 2019. accordingly, while the cpuc has not made a determination regarding sce's prudency relative to any of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, sce is unable to conclude, at this time, that uninsured
table of contents cpuc-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events are probable of recovery through electric rates.
post-2018 wildfires several wildfires have significantly impacted portions of sce's service territory after 2018, including the 2019
saddle ridge fire, the 2020 bobcat fire, the 2022 coastal fire and the 2022 fairview fire.
in 2022, sce recorded a $572 million increase in estimated losses for the post-2018 wildfires and recorded $399
million in expected insurance recoveries against the charge. in light of the prudency standard the cpuc is required to apply under ab 1054 to utilities holding a safety certificate at the time a wildfire ignited after july 12,
2019, sce has concluded, at this time, that both uninsured cpuc-jurisdictional and uninsured ferc-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs related to the post-2018 wildfires, other than for those already authorized for inclusion in electric rates, are probable of recovery through electric rates. as a result, sce also recorded expected recoveries through electric rates of $162 million against the charges accrued related to the post-2018 wildfires. the resulting net charge to earnings was $11 million ($8 million after-tax).
after giving effect to all payment obligations under settlements entered into through december 31, 2022, edison international's and sce's estimated losses (established at the lower end of the estimated range of reasonably possible losses)for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the post-2018 wildfires was $682 million. as of the same date, sce had assets for expected recoveries through insurance of $473 million and through electric rates of $166 million on their consolidated balance sheets related to the post-2018 wildfires.
expected recoveries from insurance recorded for the post-2018 wildfires are supported by sce's insurance coverage for multiple policy years. while edison international and sce may incur material losses in excess of the amounts accrued for each of the post-2018 wildfires, edison international and sce expect that any losses incurred in connection with any such fire will be covered by insurance, subject to self-insured retentions and co-insurance, and expect that any such losses after expected recoveries from insurance and through electric rates will not be material.

upstream lighting program from 2017 - 2019, sce administered the upstream lighting program, part of a statewide program administered by investor-owned utilities that offered discounted energy efficient light bulbs to customers through incentives to lighting manufacturers. the cpuc began investigating the programs administered by the investor-owned utilities based on reports that investor-owned utilities, including sce, shipped a significant number of bulbs under the program that could not be tracked to customers.
refund ratepayer funding for the portion of the program budget associated with light bulbs that were unaccounted for, (ii) refund energy efficiency incentive mechanism ("espi") awards associated with unaccounted-for light bulbs, and (iii) pay penalties for misrepresenting program progress and results to the cpuc. in september 2022, a presiding officer's decision ("pod") was issued in the proceeding finding that sce mismanaged its upstream lighting program from 2017 through 2019 and failed to ensure that efficient light bulbs were tracked and sold as intended by the program design. the pod requires sce to (i) refund to ratepayers $76.1 million, representing the portion of the program budget associated
table of contents with light bulbs that could not be accounted for, (ii) refund to ratepayers $6.8 million, representing espi awards associated with light bulbs that could not be accounted for, (iii) pay $19.06 million in fines; and (iv) bear the cost of sce's investigation, approximately $900,000. the cpuc issued its final decision in november 2022 in line with the pod. results of operations sce sce's results of operations are derived mainly through two sources:
earning activities - representing revenue authorized by the cpuc and the ferc, which is intended to provide sce a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its net investment in generation,
●  transmission, and distribution assets. the annual revenue requirements are comprised of authorized operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, taxes and a return consistent with the capital structure. also, included in earnings activities are revenue or penalties related to incentive mechanisms, other operating revenue and regulatory charges or disallowances.
cost-recovery activities - representing cpuc- and ferc-authorized balancing accounts which allow for recovery of specific project or program costs, subject to reasonableness review or compliance with upfront standards, as well as non-bypassable rates collected for sce recovery funding llc. cost-recovery activities
●  include rates which provide recovery, subject to reasonableness review of, among other things, fuel costs, purchased power costs, public purpose related-program costs (including energy efficiency and demand-side management programs), certain operation and maintenance expenses, (including vegetation management and wildfire insurance), and repayment of bonds and financing costs of sce recovery funding llc. sce earns no return on these activities.

supplemental operating revenue information as a result of the cpuc-authorized decoupling mechanism, sce revenues are not affected by changes in retail electricity sales. income taxes lower income tax expense of $126 million in
2022 compared to 2021 (a tax benefit was recorded in 2022) was primarily driven by a decrease in pre-tax income and the absence of a one-time charge recorded in 2021. in july 2021, sce received the irs's response to its private letter ruling request, regarding the scope of the deferred tax normalization requirements and the computations required to comply with the average rate assumption method. as a result of the irs ruling, sce's estimate changed, and a charge was recorded in 2021 to reduce the 2018 through 2021 cumulative tax benefits returned to customers.
the effective tax rates were (12.9)% and 1.8% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. sce's effective tax rate is below the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2022 and 2021 primarily due to the cpuc's ratemaking treatment for the current tax benefit arising from certain property-related and other temporary differences, which reverse
table of contents over time. the accounting treatment for these temporary differences results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that would otherwise be recorded to deferred income tax expense. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 8. income taxes" for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective income tax rates. edison international parent and other results of operations for edison international parent and other include amounts from other subsidiaries that are not reportable as segments, as well as intercompany eliminations. loss from operations the following table summarizes the results of edison international parent and other:
$165 million in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to an income tax benefit of $110 million recorded in 2021
related to the settlement of the 2007 - 2012 california tax audits with the ftb and higher preferred dividends in
2022. liquidity and capital resources sce sce's ability to operate its business, fund capital expenditures, and implement its business strategy is dependent upon its cash flow and access to the bank and capital markets. sce's overall cash flows fluctuate based on, among other things, its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates, changes in commodity prices and volumes, collateral requirements, interest obligations, dividend payments to and equity contributions from edison international, obligations to preference shareholders, and the outcome of tax, regulatory and legal matters. in the next 12 months, sce expects to fund its cash requirements through operating cash flows, capital market and bank financings and equity contributions from edison international parent, as needed. sce also has availability under its credit facility to fund cash requirements. sce expects to issue bonds to finance or refinance eligible sustainable projects. eligible sustainable projects include categories such as renewable energy, clean transportation, energy efficiency and carbon reduction, climate change adaptation, and socioeconomic advancement and empowerment. sce maintains processes to ensure that proceeds from the sale of the bonds are only used for projects that are aligned with the edison international sustainable financing framework issued in june 2021. sce also expects to issue additional debt for general corporate purposes and to finance payments for future resolutions of claims related to the 2017/2018
wildfire/mudslide events. sce has invested all $1.6 billion of the required ab 1054 excluded capital expenditures.
sce issued securitized bonds in the amounts of $338 million and $533 million in february 2021 and 2022, respectively, to finance a portion of these expenditures.sce expects to use the proceeds of future securitized bonds to repay a term loan of $730 million prior to its maturity in may 2023, which financed the remaining ab 1054
excluded capital expenditures . sce has filed a regulatory application for authorization to issue additional securitized bonds. for further information, see "-regulatory proceedings-financing order."
table of contents the ira was signed into law in august 2022. see "-edison international parent and other- edison international income taxes" for a description of the impacts of the legislation on the edison international consolidated tax group including sce. the following table summarizes sce's current, long-term issuer credit ratings and outlook from the major credit rating agencies:
moody's     fitch       s&p credit rating    baa2        bbb-        bbb outlook          positive    positive    stable sce's credit ratings may be affected if, among other things, regulators fail to successfully implement ab 1054 in a consistent and credit supportive manner or the wildfire insurance fund is depleted by claims from catastrophic wildfires. credit rating downgrades increase the cost and may impact the availability of short-term and long-term borrowings, including commercial paper, credit facilities, bond financings or other borrowings. in addition, some of sce's power procurement contracts and environmental remediation obligations would require sce to pay related liabilities or post additional collateral if sce's credit rating were to fall below investment grade. for further details, see "-margin and collateral deposits." available liquidity at december 31, 2022, sce had cash on hand of
$766 million and approximately $2.7 billion available to borrow on its $3.4 billion revolving credit facility. the credit facility is available for borrowing needs until may 2026. at december 31, 2022, sce had $195 million outstanding commercial paper, net of discount, at a weighted average interest rate of 5.20%. the aggregate maximum principal amount under the sce revolving credit facility may be increased up to $4.0 billion, provided that additional lender commitments are obtained. for further details, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 5. debt and credit agreements." sce may finance balancing account undercollections and working capital requirements to support operations and capital expenditures with commercial paper, its credit facilities or other borrowings, subject to availability in the bank and capital markets. as necessary, sce will utilize its available liquidity, capital market financings, other borrowings or parent company contributions to sce equity in order to meet its obligations as they become due, including costs related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events. for further information, see "management overview-southern california wildfires and mudslides." debt covenant sce's credit facilities and term loan require a debt to total capitalization ratio as defined in the applicable agreements of less than or equal to 0.65 to 1. at december 31, 2022, sce's debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.56 to 1. at december 31, 2022, sce was in compliance with all financial covenants that affect access to capital. regulatory proceedings wildfire related regulatory proceedings in response to the increase in wildfire activity, and faster progression of and increased damage from wildfires across sce's service territory and throughout california, sce has incurred wildfire mitigation, wildfire insurance and wildfire and drought restoration related spending at levels significantly exceeding amounts authorized in sce's grcs.
2021 general rate case wildfire mitigation memorandum account balances the 2021 grc decision authorized the establishment of balancing accounts for expenses for vegetation management, wildfire insurance, and the wccp program, with expenditures up to certain thresholds approved for cost recovery.
sce may submit subsequent reasonableness review applications for any spending in excess of these thresholds. sce has incurred, and in 2023 expects to incur, vegetation management expenses and capital expenditures for wccp in excess of thresholds established in the 2021 grc. sce has also incurred, and in 2023 expects to incur, costs in excess of amounts authorized in the 2021 grc related to other wildfire mitigation activities, including inspections and maintenance and to support execution of psps events. sce tracks these incremental amounts in memorandum accounts which will be subject to approval in future regulatory proceedings. for more information see
"business-sce-overview of ratemaking process."
in june 2022, sce filed an application with the cpuc requesting reasonableness review of these incremental costs incurred in 2021 related to non-covered conductor wildfire mitigation and vegetation management activities, requesting a total revenue requirement of approximately $327 million. in october 2022, the cpuc temporarily suspended the procedural schedule for the proceeding to consider whether there is a sufficient record in the proceeding to address the issue of whether recorded costs are incremental, reasonable, and properly recoverable. in december 2022, the cpuc began to conduct an audit of sce's 2021 incurred costs, with an expectation of issuing an audit report in july 2023.
$385 million of incremental wildfire mitigation operation and maintenance expense and approved $465 million of incremental wildfire mitigation capital expenditures as reasonable. sce did not obtain a determination of reasonableness for an additional $197 million of capital expenditures, associated with construction in progress, plant assets and installation of current limiting fuses, portions of which were defective. sce expects to provide additional information supporting its application for recovery of approximately $25 million of current limiting fuses expenditure in its 2025 grc application. the construction in progress not approved as reasonable in the 2021
grc track 3 was not eligible for inclusion in sce's final financing order application, but is being recovered as part of sce's authorized rate base included in the 2021 grc decision on a forecast basis.
the decision did not find reasonable certain capital expenditures related to vegetation management software purchased by sce. as a result of the decision, sce recorded a $17 million impairment of utility property, plant and equipment.
in october 2022, sce filed a request to seek recovery of $35 million, after accounting for a $10 million deductible, for vegetation management-related operations and maintenance expenses not approved in this proceeding.
these increased costs are tracked in a "z-factor" memorandum account for vegetation management line clearance costs related to senate bill 247, which went into effect january 1, 2020, and requires sce to pay line clearance tree trimmers the prevailing wage of qualified electrical workers.
the decision resulted in a revenue requirement of approximately $400 million including a $15 million 2020 revenue requirement for capital expenditures previously found reasonable by the cpuc. the approved revenue requirements are required to be amortized over a 36-month period. sce is seeking recovery of the approved capital expenditures in a separate financing order application. see "- financing order" below.
wildfire expense memorandum account sce tracks insurance premium costs related to wildfire liability insurance policies as well as other wildfire-
related costs in its wema. in december 2020, sce filed a wema application with the cpuc to seek recovery of $215
million of costs recorded in wema at december 31, 2020. the costs primarily related to incremental wildfire insurance premium
table of contents expenses and associated costs for wildfire liability insurance policies that provide coverage for the last six months of 2020. in october 2022, the cpuc extended the statutory deadline for completion of the proceeding to april
sce believes that uninsured cpuc-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs related to the post-2018 wildfires, other than for those already authorized for inclusion in electric rates, are probable of recovery through electric rates.
as of december 31, 2022, sce has recorded total expected recoveries related to the post-2018 wildfires of $152 million within the wema and risk management balancing accounts.
2020 emergency wildfire restoration multiple wildfires occurred during 2020 which caused damage within sce's service territory and to sce's big creek hydroelectric facility.
in march 2022, sce filed a cema application requesting recovery of $207 million of operation and maintenance expenses incremental to authorized revenue requirements and $312 million of capital expenditures incremental to amounts authorized in the 2021 grc primarily related to these restoration efforts. sce has not yet filed for recovery of generation restoration costs, as repairs to hydroelectric generation facilities are not complete.
sce made its 2021 grc track 4 filing with the cpuc in may 2022. sce is requesting a revenue requirement of
$8.6 billion for 2024. this represents an increase of $938 million compared to sce's revenue requirement of $7.7
billion for the 2023 attrition year. a significant component of the track 4 revenue requirement request relates to projects previously authorized by the cpuc, including those which were completed and put into service since the
2021 grc final decision. the other primary drivers of the increase are inflation and sce's 2024 vegetation management and wildfire mitigation spending forecasts, partially due to a legislatively required wage rate increase. the schedule adopted by the cpuc for the 2021 grc track 4 filing calls for a proposed decision in the fourth quarter of 2023.
financing order in september 2022, sce filed its third application for an irrevocable order from the cpuc to finance $772 million, comprised of ab1054 excluded capital expenditures, allowed overhead costs and associated financing expenses, through the issuance of securitized bonds. the expenditures consist of $204 million approved in the 2021 grc track
1 and $465 million approved in the 2021 grc track 3. sce received a proposed decision on this application in january 2023, which would authorize the issuance of securitized bonds, if approved. sce expects a final decision in the first quarter of 2023.
csrp in september 2022, the cpuc approved sce's csrp proceeding for expenditures incurred through april 2021. the approval resulted in a revenue requirement of $388 million through december 2024. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 1. summary of significant accounting polices- impairments of long-lived assets" for further information.
in may 2022, sce filed a second csrp application with the cpuc requesting recovery of $59 million of capital expenditures and $28 million of operation and maintenance expenses incurred from may 2021 to december 2021. sce also expects to propose review and cost recovery for additional post-implementation csrp costs incurred from january 2022 through december 2024 in its 2025 grc filing.
table of contents erra proceeding sce's cost-recovery mechanism for its fuel and purchased power-related costs is facilitated in three main balancing accounts, the erra, the paba, and the nsgba. sce sets rates based on an annual forecast of the costs that it expects to incur during the subsequent year. the undercollection in erra and paba during 2022 resulted in sce triggering an established mechanism requiring sce to file an application to advise the cpuc that sce's undercollections had exceeded the trigger amount. in december 2022, the cpuc approved inclusion of the undercollection in a january 1, 2023 rate change.
at december 31, 2022, the erra and paba were undercollected by approximately $1.5 billion due to higher gas and power prices and in january 2023, sce notified the cpuc of a further trigger of the mechanism. due to the new rate effective in january 2023, undercollections are expected to decrease, however, if undercollections remain above the trigger level, it could result in a further adjustment to customer rates during 2023. see "business-sce-overview of ratemaking process" for further information.
in october 2022, as part of the 2020 erra review proceeding, the cpuc rejected the methodology sce used to calculate the portion of uncollectibles expense incremental to amounts authorized in sce's grc. this led to a disallowance of $16 million of uncollectibles expense recorded to the residential uncollectible balancing account
("ruba") in 2020. beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, sce modified its methodology for calculating incremental uncollectibles expense to be included in ruba to align with the decision.
2023 ferc formula rate annual update in november 2022, sce filed its 2023 annual transmission revenue requirement update with the ferc, with the proposed rate effective january 1, 2023. the update reflects a $2 million increase from sce's 2022 transmission revenue requirement included in customer rates. the 2023 filing was in line with the 2022 transmission revenue requirement due to significant wildfire-related claims expenses recorded in both years.
2022 california arrearage payment program ("capp 2022")
in june 2022, california's state assembly passed legislation to authorize, fund and implement the capp 2022, which is expected to reduce customer arrearages for certain residential customers of california's investor-owned utilities by up to $1.0 billion. in november 2022, sce received $202 million of capp funds on behalf of customers, which has been applied to accounts receivable outstanding from individual customers. to the extent sce's uncollectibles expenses have been offset by the capp 2022, recovery will not be sought through other mechanisms.
building electrification programs application in december 2021, sce filed a $677 million building electrification program application for a four-year program
(2024 - 2027) to incentivize replacing 250,000 gas-fueled water and space heaters with efficient electric heat pumps and to upgrade or enhance the electrical infrastructure for 65,000 homes to support electrification. the proposed program would include $200 million for customer-side electrical infrastructure upgrades for which sce has requested inclusion as a regulatory asset in rate base, $69 million in capital expenditures and $408 million of operations and maintenance expense including heat pump incentives, program administration, and implementation costs. the cpuc is expected to issue a final decision on the application in mid-2023.

riverside transmission reliability project the riverside transmission reliability project is a joint project between sce and riverside public utilities ("rpu"), the municipal utility department of the city of riverside.
while rpu will be responsible for constructing some of the project's facilities within riverside, sce's portion of the project consists of constructing upgrades to its system, including a new 230 kv substation; certain interconnection and telecommunication facilities and transmission lines in the cities of riverside, jurupa valley and norco and in portions of unincorporated riverside county. in may 2022, the riverside city council voted to review and advise on alternatives to the cpuc approved project. consequently, sce suspended all major activities on the project. in january 2023, the city council voted to establish a working group to pursue funding for additional undergrounding. sce's capital forecast currently includes $128 million and $190 million of riverside transmission reliability project expenditures in 2023 and 2024, respectively, which may be affected by further delays to the project. alberhill system project the alberhill system project consists of constructing a new 500 kv substation, two 500 kv transmission lines to connect the proposed substation to the existing serrano-valley 500 kv transmission line, telecommunication equipment and subtransmission lines in western riverside county. the project was designed to meet long-term forecasted electrical demand in the proposed alberhill system project area and to increase electrical system reliability and resiliency. in april 2018 and july 2018, the cpuc issued a proposed decision and an alternate proposed decision, both denying sce's ability to construct the alberhill system project based on a perceived lack of need. sce filed comments on both proposed decisions requesting that the cpuc grant the certificate of public convenience and necessity ("cpcn") for the alberhill system project. in august 2018, the cpuc issued a decision that did not deny or approve the alberhill system project but directed sce to submit supplemental information on the alberhill system project including but not limited to a load forecast and cost benefit analysis of several alternatives to the proposed project. ongoing capital spending has been deferred as a result of the cpuc request for additional information. in january 2020, sce submitted a supplemental analysis to the cpuc for the alberhill system project including several alternatives to the proposed project as well as an update to the original project cost. a final decision on the alberhill system project remains
table of contents pending. given the uncertainty associated with the resolution of the permitting process, potential revisions to the project have not been reflected in total direct expenditures. sce continues to believe a system solution is needed for the project area but is unable to predict the timing of a final cpuc decision in connection with the alberhill system project proceeding.
approximately 48% of the alberhill system project costs spent to date would be subject to recovery through cpuc revenue and 52% through ferc revenue. in october 2017, sce obtained approval from the ferc for abandoned plant treatment for the alberhill system project, which allows sce to seek recovery of 100% of all prudently incurred costs after the approval date and 50% of prudently incurred costs prior to the approval date. excluding land costs, which may be recovered through sale to a third party, sce has incurred approximately $59 million and $55 million of capital expenditures, including overhead costs, of which approximately $42 million and $39 million may not be recoverable if the project is cancelled, as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
eldorado-lugo-mohave upgrade project the eldorado-lugo-mohave upgrade project will increase capacity on existing transmission lines to allow additional renewable energy to flow from nevada to southern california. the project would modify sce's existing eldorado, lugo, and mohave electrical substations to accommodate the increased flows from nevada to southern california;
increase the power flow through the existing 500 kv transmission lines by constructing two new capacitors along the lines; raise transmission tower heights to meet ground clearance requirements; and install fiber optics on the transmission lines to provide communications between existing sce substations. in august 2020, the cpuc approved the cpcn for the project.
construction for the project began in november 2020 and the project is expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2023.

decommissioning of san onofre the decommissioning of a nuclear plant requires the management of three related activities: radiological decommissioning, non-radiological decommissioning and the management of spent nuclear fuel. sce has engaged the dgc to undertake a significant scope of decommissioning activities for units 1, 2 and 3 at san onofre. the decommissioning of san onofre is expected to take many years.
under federal law, the u.s. department of energy ("doe") is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. the doe has not met its contractual obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel. extended delays by the doe have led to the construction of costly alternatives and associated siting and environmental issues.
two independent spent fuel storage installations ("isfsi") store nuclear fuel onsite at san onofre. the first primarily stores nuclear fuel from unit 1 ("isfsi 1") and the second stores nuclear fuel from units 2 and 3 ("isfsi
2"). sce's cdps for isfsi 1 and isfsi 2 extend through 2035.
decommissioning of san onofre unit 1 began in 1999 and the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from unit 1 to dry cask storage in isfsi 1 was completed in 2005. major decommissioning work for unit 1 has been completed except for certain underground work.
table of contents decommissioning of san onofre units 2 and 3 began in june 2013 and the transfer of spent nuclear fuel from san onofre units 2 and 3 to dry cask storage in the two isfsis was completed in august 2020. in october 2019, the california coastal commission approved sce's application for a cdp, the principal discretionary permit required to start major decommissioning activities at san onofre units 2 and 3. in august 2020, sce commenced, and is currently conducting, major decommissioning activities in accordance with the terms of the permit.
in the third quarter of 2021, sce updated its decommissioning cost estimate for decommissioning activities to be completed at san onofre units 2 and 3 to $3.4 billion (sce share is $2.6 billion) in 2021 dollars. the decommissioning cost estimate included costs through the expected decommissioning completion date, currently estimated to be in 2053 for san onofre units 2 and 3. sce filed its updated decommissioning cost estimate with the cpuc in february 2022. decommissioning cost estimates are subject to a number of uncertainties including the cost and timing of nuclear waste disposal, the time it will take to obtain required permits, cost of removal of property, site remediation costs, as well as a number of other assumptions and estimates, including when the federal government will provide for either interim or permanent off-site storage of spent nuclear fuel enabling the removal and transport of spent fuel canisters from the san onofre site, as to which there can be no assurance. cost estimates are subject to change as decommissioning proceeds and such changes may be material.
sce's share of the san onofre units 2 and 3 decommissioning costs recorded during 2022 and 2021 were $187 million
(in 2022 dollars) and $236 million (in 2021 dollars), respectively. the cpuc conducts a reasonableness review of recorded decommissioning costs.
in february 2022, sce filed its application for reasonableness review of approximately $570 million (sce share in
2022 dollars) of recorded san onofre units 2 and 3 decommissioning costs incurred during the period 2018 to 2020.
intervenors in the proceeding have recommended approximately $115 million (sce share in 2022 dollars) in disallowances for san onofre units 2 and 3 decommissioning costs. this amount includes a recommended disallowance of approximately $45 million in costs associated with an august 2018 incident that occurred when an sce contractor was loading a spent nuclear fuel canister into an isfsi resulting in fuel transfer operations being suspended for approximately one year. the remainder of the recommended disallowance amount is primarily for contractor staffing costs incurred during a delay in issuance of the cdp to allow for decommissioning.
sce had nuclear decommissioning trust funds for san onofre units 2 and 3 of $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion as of december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively. based upon the resolution of a number of uncertainties, including the uncertainties of decommissioning discussed above, the financial performance of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, as well as the resolution of a number of other assumptions and estimates, additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust's funds may be required. if additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds become necessary, sce will seek recovery of such additional funds through electric rates and any such recovery will be subject to a reasonableness review by the cpuc. cost increases resulting from contractual disputes, delays in performance by the contractor, elevated levels of inflation, or permitting delays, among other things, could cause sce to materially overrun the decommissioning cost estimate and could materially impact the sufficiency of trust funds.
in december 2022, the cpuc approved disbursements from sce's nuclear decommissioning trusts to cover forecasted
2023 decommissioning costs for san onofre units 2 and 3, of which sce's share is approximately $300 million in 2023
table of contents sce dividends cpuc holding company rules require that sce's dividend policy be established by sce's board of directors on the same basis as if sce were a stand-alone utility company, and that the capital requirements of sce, as deemed to be necessary to meet sce's electricity service obligations, shall receive first priority from the boards of directors of both edison international and sce. in addition, the cpuc regulates sce's capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay to its shareholders.
the common equity component of sce's cpuc authorized capital structure is 52% on a weighted average basis over the capital structure compliance period, unchanged from the january 1, 2020 to december 31, 2022 compliance period. the cpuc authorized capital structure differs from the capital structure calculated based on gaap due to certain exclusions allowed by cpuc, including the impact of sce's contributions to the wildfire insurance fund under ab
1054. for further information, see "business-sce-overview of ratemaking process" and "business-southern california wildfires."
in may 2020, the cpuc issued a decision on sce's application to the cpuc for waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement, that allows sce to exclude from its equity ratio calculations (i) net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events and (ii) debt issued for the purpose of paying claims related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events up to an amount equal to the net charges accrued in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events. with these exclusions, sce was in compliance with its authorized capital structure for the compliance period from january 1, 2020 to december 31, 2022. the temporary exclusion lapsed on may 7, 2022. in april 2022, sce filed another application requesting continued waiver of compliance with its equity ratio requirement. under the cpuc's rules, sce will not be deemed to be in violation of the equity ratio requirement while the waiver application is pending resolution. while the exclusion is in place, sce is required to notify the cpuc if an adverse financial event reduces sce's spot equity ratio by more than one percent from the level most recently filed with the cpuc in the proceeding. the last spot equity ratio sce filed with the cpuc in the proceeding did not exclude the then $1.8 billion net charge and was 45.2% as of december 31, 2018 (at the time the common equity component of sce's cpuc authorized capital structure was required to remain at or above 48% on a weighted average basis over the applicable 37-month period). sce's spot equity ratio on december 31, 2018 would have been 48.7% had the $1.8 billion net charge at december 31, 2018 been excluded, therefore sce will notify the cpuc if its spot ratio drops below 47.7% in any quarter.for further information, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides."
sce monitors its compliance with the cpuc's equity ratio requirement based on the weighted average of the common equity component of sce's cpuc authorized capital structure over the capital structure compliance period using its actual capital structure from the beginning of the capital structure compliance period through the reporting date together with forecasted performance and expected financing activities for the remainder of the capital structure compliance period. sce expects to be compliant with its cpuc authorized capital structure at the end of the capital structure compliance period.
sce's ability to declare and pay common dividends may be restricted under the terms of its outstanding series of preference stock. for further information see"notes to consolidated financial statements-note 14. equity."
as a california corporation, sce's ability to pay dividends is also governed by the california general corporation law. california law requires that for a dividend to be declared: (a) retained earnings must equal or exceed the proposed dividend, or (b) immediately after the dividend is made, the value of the corporation's assets must exceed the value of its liabilities plus amounts required to be paid, if any, in order to liquidate stock senior to the shares receiving the dividend. additionally, a california corporation may not declare a dividend if it is, or as a result of the dividend would be, likely to be unable to meet its liabilities as they mature. prior to declaring dividends, sce's board of directors evaluates available information, including when applicable, information pertaining to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, to ensure
table of contents that the california law requirements for the declarations are met. on february 23, 2023, sce declared a dividend to edison international of $350 million.
the timing and amount of future dividends are also dependent on a number of other factors including sce's requirements to fund other obligations and capital expenditures, and its ability to access the capital markets and generate operating cash flows and earnings. if sce incurs significant costs related to catastrophic wildfires and is unable to recover such costs through insurance, the wildfire insurance fund (for fires after july 12, 2019), or from customers or is unable to access capital markets on reasonable terms, sce may be limited in its ability to pay future dividends to edison international and its preference shareholders.
margin and collateral deposits certain derivative instruments, power and energy procurement contracts and other contractual arrangements contain collateral requirements. in addition, certain environmental remediation obligations require financial assurance that may be in the form of collateral postings. future collateral requirements may differ from the requirements at december 31, 2022 due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements, if any, the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on sce's contractual obligations, and the impact of sce's credit ratings falling below investment grade.
the table below provides the amount of collateral posted by sce to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would have been required as of december 31, 2022, if sce's credit rating had been downgraded to below investment grade as of that date. the table below also provides the potential collateral that could be required due to adverse changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices over the remaining lives of existing power and fuel derivative contracts. natural gas prices have increased significantly in 2022 due to global demand and extreme weather conditions in the usa, which resulted in substantially higher collateral postings and potential collateral requirements during the year.
in addition to amounts shown in the table, power and fuel contract counterparties may also institute new collateral requirements, applicable to future transactions to allow sce to continue trading in power and fuel contracts at the time of a downgrade or upon significant increases in market prices. in particular, sce has an agreement with a counterparty for gas transport and balancing services through their pipeline. in december 2022, extreme winter conditions combined with pipeline constraints led to extremely high natural gas prices and usage, which affected collateral terms within the arrangement. through december 31, 2022, the counterparty could have contractually requested $118 million in collateral from sce but waived the amount, given the extraordinary conditions.
furthermore, sce may also be required to post up to $50 million in collateral in connection with its environmental remediation obligations, within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year in which the downgrade occurs.

12 months, edison international expects to fund its net cash requirements through cash on hand, dividends from sce, and capital market and bank financings. edison international may finance its ongoing cash requirements, including dividends, working capital requirements, payment of obligations, and capital investments, including capital contributions to subsidiaries, with short-term or other financings, subject to availability in the bank and capital markets. at december 31, 2022, edison international parent had cash on hand of $148 million and $1.4 billion available to borrow on its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. the credit facility is available for borrowing needs until may 2026. at december 31, 2022 edison international parent had $90 million outstanding commercial paper, net of discount, at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.92% supported by the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. the aggregate maximum principal amount under the edison international parent revolving credit facility may be increased up to $2.0 billion, provided that additional lender commitments are obtained.for further details, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 5. debt and credit agreements." edison international parent has $1.4 billion of debt maturities arising in the next 12 months. edison international expects to finance these maturities with $300 million to $400 million of equity content, as viewed by ratings agencies, and expects to issue debt for the remainder. in august 2022, edison international parent established a program to sell shares of its common stock with aggregate sales price up to $500 million, including through designated broker-dealers at prevailing market prices (an at-the-market offering). for further information, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 14. equity." on february 23, 2023, edison international declared a dividend of $0.7375 per share to be paid on april 30, 2023. edison international parent and other's liquidity and its ability to pay operating expenses and pay dividends to common shareholders are dependent on access to the bank and capital markets, dividends from sce, realization of tax benefits and its ability to meet california law requirements for the declaration of dividends. prior to declaring dividends, edison international's board of directors evaluates available information, including when applicable, information pertaining to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, to ensure that the california law requirements for the declarations are met. for information on the california law requirements on the declaration of dividends, see "-sce-sce dividends." edison international intends to maintain its target payout ratio of 45% - 55% of sce's core earnings, subject to the factors identified above. edison international's ability to declare and pay common dividends may be restricted under the terms of the series a and series b preferred stock. for further information see"notes to consolidated financial statements-note 14. equity."
table of contents edison international parent's credit facility requires a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio as defined in the applicable agreements of less than or equal to 0.70 to 1. at december 31, 2022, edison international's consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.64 to 1. at december 31, 2022, edison international parent was in compliance with all financial covenants that affect access to capital. the following table summarizes edison international parent's current long-term issuer credit ratings and outlook from the major credit rating agencies:

net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the following: net income and non-cash items increased in
2022 by $186 million from 2021 primarily due to higher revenue due to the escalation mechanism as set forth in the
2021 grc final decision and higher return on rate base from capital balancing accounts, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses and higher interest expense. net cash provided by operating activities was also impacted by cash outflow of $95 million related to sce's contributions to the wildfire insurance fund in both 2022
and 2021. see "business-southern california wildfires" for further information.
table of contents net cash inflow (outflow) for working capital was $327 million and $(705) million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
the net cash inflow for working capital for 2022 was mainly due to an increase in payables of $343 million driven by higher payables on power purchase contracts and a net decrease of $24 million in customer receivables and unbilled revenue primarily from $387 million of capp funds received in 2022, partially offset by lower collections.
the net cash outflow for working capital in 2021 was mainly due to net increases in unbilled revenue and customer receivables of
$700 million. net cash used in regulatory assets and liabilities, including the increase in net undercollections of balancing accounts, was $51 million and $720 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. sce has a number of balancing and memorandum accounts, which impact cash flows based on differences between timing of collection of amounts through rates and accrual expenditures. cash flows were primarily impacted by the following: 2022
net undercollections of brrba increased by $259 million primarily due to inclusion in brrba of $401 million of revenue requirement authorized under grc track 2 for collection in customer rates starting march 2022
over a 36-month period, a revenue requirement of approximately $400 million authorized under grc track 3 for
●  collection in customer rates starting october 2022 over a 36-month period, and $174 million csrp related expenses approved in september 2022. these higher undercollections were partially offset by current year overcollections due to higher sales volume and average rates due to extreme heat in california and recovery of prior year undercollections, including 2021 grc authorized additional revenue requirement for the first nine months of 2021 to be collected over a 27-month period starting october 2021.
undercollections decreased by $180 million related to wildfire risk mitigation and restoration memorandum
●  and balancing accounts as a result of approval to recover costs in grc track 2 and track 3, which were transferred to brrba for recovery as mentioned above, partially offset by additional wema and wildfire risk mitigation and restoration costs incurred.
net undercollections for erra, paba and nsgba increased by $795 million primarily due to current year
●  undercollections due to higher than forecast energy prices and load, partially offset by higher sales volume and higher average rates driven by extreme heat in california and recovery of prior paba and nsgba undercollections.
●  increased overcollections of $511 million for the public purpose and energy efficiency programs primarily due to lower program spending due to timing and increased sales volume.
net overcollection increased by $178 million for the ferc balancing accounts primarily due to current year
●  overcollections due to higher sales volume, recovery of prior year undercollections and lower operating expenses than amounts included in revenue requirements.
●  increase in overcollections of $56 million for excess california department of water resources ("dwr") bond and power charges to be refunded to customers over a 12-month period beginning in june 2022.
●  million approved expense to brrba as mentioned above, partially offset by related deferred csrp post implementation costs.
net undercollections of brrba increased by $227 million primarily driven by adoption of the 2021 grc final
●  decision, including 2021 authorized revenue requirements to be collected over a 27-month period starting october
●  undercollections of $364 million were related to wildfire-related expenses that are probable of future recovery from customers.
●  restoration costs, which was transferred to brrba for recovery, partially offset by additional restoration costs due to wildfire events in 2020.
net undercollections for erra, paba and the nsgba increased by $251 million primarily due to current year
●  transfer of $182 million to erra and public purpose programs, partially offset by additional customer uncollectible expenses.
●  undercollections of $98 million in the csrp memorandum account were related to csrp implementation costs.
cash flows (used in) or provided by other noncurrent assets and liabilities were primarily related to an increase in wildfire insurance receivables of $(398) million in 2022 and an insurance recovery of $708 million in 2021. see

contractual obligations and contingencies contractual obligations sce and edison international parent and other have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements.
other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. for details on long-term debt, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 5. debt and credit agreements." certain power purchase agreements which sce entered into with independent power producers are treated as operating or finance leases. in addition, sce has other operating lease obligations primarily related to vehicles, office space and other equipment. for further discussion, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies" and "-note 13. leases." sce also has other purchase obligations primarily related to maintaining reliability and expanding sce's transmission and distribution system and nuclear fuel supply contracts. for further discussion, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies." edison international parent and other and sce have estimated contributions to the pension and pbop plans. these amounts represent estimates that are based on assumptions that are subject to change. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 9. compensation and benefit plans" for further information. edison international and sce have a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions. edison international and sce cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these

(aggregate liquidation preference) of 5.00%, trust securities, respectively, to the public. in 2020, sce trust ii redeemed $180 million of its trust securities from the public, from its issued trust securities of $400 million.
see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 3. variable interest entities." market risk exposures edison international's and sce's primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices and volumes, and counterparty credit. derivative instruments are used to manage market risks including market risks to sce's customers. for further discussion of market risk exposures, including commodity price risk, credit risk and interest rate risk, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 6. derivative instruments" and "-note 4.
fair value measurements." interest rate risk edison international and sce are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of financing, investing and borrowing activities used for liquidity purposes, and to fund business operations and capital investments. the nature and amount of edison international's and sce's long-term and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. fluctuations in interest rates can affect earnings and cash flows. changes in interest rates may impact sce's authorized rate of return for the period beyond 2023 through a cpuc cost of capital adjustment mechanism, see "liquidity and capital resources-sce" and "business-sce-overview of ratemaking process" for further discussion. the following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair value of long-term debt including the current portion, if the market interest rates were changed while leaving all other assumptions the same:

commodity price risk sce and its customers are exposed to the risk of a change in the market price of natural gas, electric power and transmission congestion. due to regulatory mechanisms, exposure to commodity prices is not expected to impact
table of contents earnings but may impact timing of cash flows. sce's hedging program is designed to reduce exposure to variability in market prices related to sce's purchases and sales of electric power and natural gas. as part of this program, sce enters into energy options, swaps, forward arrangements and congestion revenue rights ("crrs"). the transactions are pre-approved by the cpuc or executed in compliance with cpuc-approved procurement plans.
therefore, sce expects recovery of its related hedging costs, as well as procurement costs, through the erra balancing account or cpuc-approved procurement plans. for more details of the erra balancing account, see
"liquidity and capital resources-sce-regulatory proceedings-erra proceeding" and "business-sce-overview of ratemaking process." fair value of derivative instruments the fair value of derivative instruments is included in the consolidated balance sheets unless subject to an exception under the applicable accounting guidance. realized gains and losses from derivative instruments are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and, accordingly, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments have no impact on earnings. sce does not use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment. for further discussion on fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy, see "notes to consolidated financial statements- note 4. fair value measurements." the fair value of outstanding derivative instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk was a net asset of $240 million and $44 million at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair values of the net asset of derivative instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets, if the electricity prices or gas prices were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant:
increase in electricity prices by 10%    $            22    $    13
decrease in electricity prices by 10%                -22        -13
investment price risk edison international and sce are subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust and various pension and other post-retirement benefit plan trusts.
nuclear decommissioning trust as of december 31, 2022, sce's nuclear decommissioning trust investments consist of equity investments of $1.6 billion and fixed income investments of $2.2 billion. these investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. sce's investment policies and cpuc requirements place limitations on the types and investment grade ratings of the securities that may be held by the nuclear decommissioning trust. these policies restrict the trust from holding alternative investments and limit the trust funds' exposures to investments in highly illiquid markets. due to regulatory mechanisms, investment earnings and realized and unrealized gains and losses increase or decrease the trust assets and the related regulatory asset or liability, and do not materially affect earnings. for further discussion on the nuclear decommissioning trust investments, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 4. fair value measurements" and "-note 10.
investments." pbop and pension plan assets the pbop plan and the southern california edison company retirement plan trust assets include investments in equity securities, u.s. treasury securities, other fixed-income securities, common/collective funds, mutual funds, other investment entities, foreign exchange and interest rate contracts, and partnership/joint ventures. these investments are
table of contents exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. the investment of plan assets is overseen by a fiduciary investment committee. risk is managed through diversification among multiple asset classes, managers, styles and securities. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 9. compensation and benefit plans" for additional information regarding investment strategy of plan assets.
a significant decline in the value of plan assets could require sce to increase funding of its pension and pbop plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. annual contributions related to sce employees made to sce plans are anticipated to be recovered through cpuc-approved regulatory mechanisms.
credit risk credit risk exposure from counterparties for power and gas trading activities is measured as the sum of net accounts receivable (accounts receivable less accounts payable) and the current fair value of net derivative assets
(derivative assets less derivative liabilities) reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. sce enters into master agreements which typically provide for a right of set-off. accordingly, sce's credit risk exposure from counterparties is based on a net exposure under these arrangements. sce manages the credit risk on the portfolio of counterparties based on credit ratings and other publicly disclosed information, such as financial statements, regulatory filings and press releases, to guide it in the process of setting credit levels, risk limits and contractual arrangements, including master netting agreements. based on sce's policies and risk exposures related to credit, sce does not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance. at december 31, 2022, sce's power and gas trading counterparty credit risk exposure was $239 million, all of which is associated with entities that have an investment grade rating of a or higher. sce assigns a credit rating to counterparties based on the lowest of a counterparty's s&p's, moody's and fitch's rating.
for more information related to credit risks, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 6. derivative instruments."
critical accounting estimates and policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of edison international's and sce's consolidated financial statements because their application requires the use of significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements. management estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved.
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires significant assumptions and changes in the estimate or, the use of alternative estimates, could have a material impact on edison international's and sce's results of operations or financial position. for more information on edison international's and sce's accounting policies, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 1. summary of significant accounting policies."
accounting for contingencies nature of estimates required.edison international and sce record loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized.
key assumptions and approach used.the determination of an accrual for a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates with respect to the likely outcome of the matter, including the analysis of different scenarios. liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. in assessing whether a loss is a reasonable possibility, edison international and sce may consider the following factors, among others: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, available information, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases. edison international and sce provide disclosures for material contingencies when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred.
table of contents effect if different assumptions used.actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements. for a discussion of contingencies, guarantees and indemnities, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies."
application to 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events as discussed in "management overview," wildfires in sce's territory in december 2017 and november 2018 caused loss of life, substantial damage to both residential and business properties, and service outages for sce customers.
the extent of legal liability for wildfire-related damages in actions against utilities depends on a number of factors, including whether the utility substantially caused or contributed to the damages and whether parties seeking recovery of damages will be required to show negligence in addition to causation. final determinations of legal liability for wildfire events, including determinations of whether sce was negligent, would only be made during lengthy and complex litigation processes and settlements may be reached before determinations of legal liability are ever made.
edison international and sce have incurred material losses in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events. estimated losses for the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events litigation are based on a number of assumptions and are subject to change as additional information becomes available. actual losses incurred may be higher or lower than estimated based on several factors, including the uncertainty in estimating damages that have been or may be alleged. for instance, sce will receive additional information with respect to damages claimed as the claims mediation processes progress. other factors that can cause actual losses incurred to be higher or lower than estimated include the ability to reach settlements and the outcomes of settlements reached through the ongoing claims mediation processes, uncertainties related to the sufficiency of insurance held by plaintiffs, uncertainties related to the litigation processes, including whether plaintiffs will ultimately pursue claims, uncertainty as to the legal and factual determinations to be made during litigation, including uncertainty as to the contributing causes of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, the complexities associated with fires that merge and whether inverse condemnation will be held applicable to sce with respect to damages caused by the montecito mudslides, and the uncertainty as to how these factors impact future settlements.
each reporting period, management reviews its loss estimates for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events. management's 2022 reviews included a review of large damage claims presented by a small number of plaintiffs, new lawsuits filed in the woolsey fire litigation and information obtained after the statute of limitations for individual plaintiffs for the woolsey fire expired, including information regarding the nature of claims remaining in the woolsey fire litigation. management also reviewed information obtained from settling a substantial portion of the claims in the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events litigations, including higher than expected costs to settle claims. as a result of management's reviews during
2022, sce recorded a $1.3 billion increase in estimated losses for the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events during the year.
in total, through december 31, 2022, sce has accrued estimated losses of $8.8 billion, has paid or is obligated to pay approximately $7.8 billion in settlements and has recovered $2.0 billion from its insurance carriers and approximately $234 million through ferc-jurisdictional electric rates in relation to the 2017/2018
wildfire/mudslide events. at december 31, 2022 edison international's and sce's best estimate of expected losses for remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events is $934 million.
edison international and sce may incur a material loss in excess of amounts accrued in connection with the remaining alleged and potential claims related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events. due to the number of uncertainties and possible outcomes related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events litigation, edison international and sce cannot estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses that may be incurred.
table of contents rate regulated enterprises nature of estimate required. sce follows the accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises which are required for entities whose rates are set by regulators at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. regulators may also impose penalties or grant incentives. due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue, these principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by an unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates; conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and refundable to customers. in addition, sce recognizes revenue and regulatory assets from alternative revenue programs, which enables the utility to adjust future rates in response to past activities or completed events, if certain criteria are met, even for programs that do not qualify for recognition of "traditional" regulatory assets and liabilities.
accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises also require recognition of an impairment loss if it becomes probable that the regulated utility will abandon a plant investment, or if it becomes probable that the cost of a recently completed plant will be disallowed, either directly or indirectly, for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made.
key assumptions and approach used. sce's management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment, the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost to sce or other rate-regulated entities, and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes. using these factors, management has determined that existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or settlement. this determination reflects the current regulatory climate and is subject to change in the future. sce also considers whether any plant investments are probable of abandonment or disallowance.
effect if different assumptions used. significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and plant investments, the recognition of incentives and revenue subject to refund, as well as the anticipated cost of regulatory liabilities or penalties. if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, all or part of the regulatory assets, plant investments and/or liabilities would have to be written off against current period earnings. at december 31, 2022, the consolidated balance sheets included regulatory assets of $10.7 billion and regulatory liabilities of $9.2 billion. if different judgments were reached on recovery of costs and timing of income recognition, sce's earnings may vary from the amounts reported.
application to southern california wildfires application to 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events recovery of sce's losses realized in connection with the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events in excess of available insurance is subject to approval by regulators. under accounting standards for rate-regulated enterprises, sce defers costs as regulatory assets when it concludes that such costs are probable of future recovery in electric rates. sce utilizes objectively determinable evidence to form its view on probability of future recovery. the only directly comparable precedent in which a california investor-owned utility has sought recovery for uninsured wildfire-related costs is sdg&e's requests for cost recovery related to 2007 wildfire activity, where the ferc allowed recovery of all ferc-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs while the cpuc rejected recovery of all cpuc-
jurisdictional wildfire-related costs based on a determination that sdg&e did not meet the cpuc's prudency standard. as a result, while sce does not agree with the cpuc's decision, it believes that the cpuc's interpretation and application of the prudency standard to sdg&e creates substantial uncertainty regarding how that standard will be applied to an investor-owned utility in wildfire cost-recovery proceedings for fires ignited prior to july 12, 2019. sce will continue to evaluate the probability of recovery based on available evidence, including judicial, legislative and regulatory decisions, including any cpuc
table of contents decisions illustrating the interpretation and/or application of the prudency standard when making determinations regarding recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs. while the cpuc has not made a determination regarding sce's prudency relative to any of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, sce is unable to conclude, at this time, that uninsured cpuc-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs are probable of recovery through electric rates. sce would record a regulatory asset at the time it obtains sufficient information to support a conclusion that recovery is probable.
through the operation of its ferc formula rate, and based upon the precedent established in sdg&e's recovery of ferc-jurisdictional wildfire-related costs, sce believes it is probable it will recover its ferc-jurisdictional wildfire and mudslide related costs and has recorded total expected recoveries within the ferc balancing account.
application to post-2018 wildfires management judgment was required to assess the probability of recovery of sce's losses realized in connection with the post-2018 wildfires in excess of available insurance.
the cpuc and ferc may not allow sce to recover uninsured losses through electric rates if it is determined that such losses were not reasonably or prudently incurred. on july 12, 2019, ab 1054 clarified that the cpuc must allow recovery of costs and expenses arising from a covered wildfire if the utility's conduct related to the ignition was consistent with actions that a reasonable utility would have undertaken in good faith under similar circumstances, at the relevant point in time, and based on the information available at that time. further, utilities with a valid safety certification at the time of the relevant wildfire will be presumed to have acted prudently related to a wildfire ignition unless a party in the cost recovery proceeding creates "serious doubt" as to the reasonableness of the utility's conduct, at which time, the burden shifts back to the utility to dispel that doubt and prove its conduct was prudent. the serious doubt standard in ab 1054 is modeled after the ferc cost recovery standard. sce evaluates the probability of recovery for post-2018 wildfires in the context of the prudency standard laid out by ab 1054 above. this assessment is made based on sce's status as a holder of a valid safety certificate, facts known to date related to the ignition, and any regulatory decisions illustrating the interpretation and/or application of the prudency standard under ab 1054, which as of december 31, 2022 has not been applied by the cpuc to an actual cost recovery application filed by any california investor-owned utility. sce also considers which costs are eligible for recovery based on precedents from other cpuc cost recovery proceedings. management's assessment of the probability of recovery may change, related to changes in any of these factors in the future.
income taxes nature of estimates required. as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements, edison international and sce are required to estimate income taxes for each jurisdiction in which they operate. this process involves estimating actual current period tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within edison international's and sce's consolidated balance sheets, including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether deferred tax assets can and will be utilized in future periods. based on currently enacted tax laws, edison international expects to generate sufficient taxable income beginning in 2023
to fully utilize all loss and credit carryovers set to expire beyond 2022.
edison international and sce take certain tax positions they believe are in accordance with the applicable tax laws. however, these tax positions are subject to interpretation by the internal revenue service, state tax authorities and the courts. edison international and sce determine uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance.
key assumptions and approach used. in determining whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can be utilized, management analyzes the trend of gaap earnings and then
table of contents estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies based on currently enacted tax laws. accounting for tax obligations requires management judgment. edison international's and sce's management use judgment in determining whether the evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that a tax position will be sustained, and to determine the amount of tax benefits to be recognized. judgment is also used in determining the likelihood a tax position will be settled and possible settlement outcomes. in assessing uncertain tax positions edison international and sce consider, among others, the following factors: the facts and circumstances of the position, regulations, rulings, and case law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, and the experience gained from similar tax positions. edison international and sce evaluate uncertain tax positions at the end of each reporting period and make adjustments when warranted based on changes in fact or law. effect if different assumptions used.should a change in facts or circumstances, including a change in enacted tax legislation, lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, edison international and sce would record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes. actual income taxes may differ from the estimated amounts which could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded in the financial statements. edison international and sce continue to be under audit or subject to audit for multiple years in various jurisdictions. significant judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular tax positions that involve interpretations of complex tax laws. such liabilities are based on judgment and a final determination could take many years from the time the liability is recorded. furthermore, settlement of tax positions included in open tax years may be resolved by compromises of tax positions based on current factors and business considerations that may result in material adjustments to income taxes previously estimated. for a discussion of current and deferred taxes, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, and tax disputes, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 8. income taxes." nuclear decommissioning - asset retirement obligation key assumptions and approach used.san onofre units 1, 2 and 3 decommissioning cost estimates are updated in each nuclear decommissioning cost triennial proceeding ("ndctp") and when there are material changes to the timing or amount of estimated future cash flows. palo verde decommissioning cost estimates are updated by the operating agent, arizona public services, every three years and when there are material changes to the timing or amount of estimated future cash flows. sce estimates that it will spend approximately $6.3 billion, undiscounted through 2080, to decommission its nuclear facilities. the current aro estimates for san onofre and palo verde are based on:
decommissioning costs. the estimated costs for labor, material, equipment and other, and low-level radioactive waste costs are included in each of the nrc decommissioning stages: license termination, site
●  restoration and spent fuel storage. the liability to decommission sce's nuclear power facilities is based on a 2020 decommissioning study, filed as part of the 2021 ndctp, for san onofre unit 1, 2 and 3 and a 2019
decommissioning study for palo verde, with revisions to the cost estimate in 2020.
●  for labor, material, equipment and low-level radioactive waste burial costs. sce's current estimates are based upon sce's decommissioning cost methodology used for ratemaking purposes. average escalation rates range from 2.3% to 7.5% (depending on the cost element) annually.
table of contents timing. initial decommissioning activities at san onofre unit 1 started in 1999 and at units 2 and 3 in
2013. cost estimates for san onofre units are currently based on completion of decommissioning activities by
●  2053. cost estimates for palo verde are based on an assumption that decommissioning will commence promptly after the current nrc operating licenses expire. the palo verde 1, 2, 3 operating licenses currently expire in 2045, 2046 and 2047, respectively.
spent fuel dry storage costs. cost estimates, including the impact of escalations, are based on an
2031 and will remove the last spent fuel from the san onofre and palo verde sites by 2051 and 2078, respectively.
●  changes in decommissioning technology, regulation and economics. the current cost studies assume the use of current technologies under current regulations and at current cost levels.
see "liquidity and capital resources-sce-decommissioning of san onofre" for further discussion of the plans for decommissioning of san onofre. effect if different assumptions used.the aro for decommissioning sce's nuclear facilities was $2.3 billion as of december 31, 2022, based on the decommissioning studies performed and the subsequent cost estimate updates. changes in the estimated costs, execution strategy or timing of decommissioning, or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates, could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission these facilities which could have a material effect on the recorded liability.
the following table illustrates the increase to the aro liability if the cost escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant:
uniform increase in escalation rate of 1    $                 584
percentage point the increase in the aro liability driven by an increase in the escalation rate would result in a decrease in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of aro liabilities. pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions nature of estimate required.authoritative accounting guidance requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet; the assets and/or liabilities are normally offset through other comprehensive income (loss). in accordance with authoritative guidance for rate-regulated enterprises, regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded instead of charges and credits to other comprehensive income (loss) for its postretirement benefit plans that are recoverable in utility rates. edison international and sce have a fiscal year-end measurement date for all of their postretirement plans. key assumptions of approach used.pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models. two critical assumptions, discount rate and expected return on assets, are important elements of plan expense, and the discount rate is important to liability measurement. additionally, health care cost trend rates are critical assumptions for postretirement health care plans. these critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually. other assumptions, which require management judgment, such as rate of compensation increases and rates of retirement and turnover, are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience. as of december 31,
2022, edison international's and sce's pension plans had a $3.5 billion and $3.2 billion projected benefit obligation, respectively, and total 2022 expense for these plans was $19 million and $16 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, the accumulated benefit obligation for both edison international's and sce's pbop plans were
$1.3 billion, and total 2022 expense for edison international's pbop plan were $1 million, and no expense for sce's pbop plan. annual contributions made to most of sce's pension and pbop plan are anticipated to be recovered through cpuc-approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be, at a minimum, equal to the related annual expense.
pension expense is recorded for sce based on the amount funded to the trusts, as calculated using an actuarial method required for ratemaking purposes, in which the impact of market volatility on plan assets is recognized in earnings on a more gradual basis. any difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with ratemaking methods and pension expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for pension is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability, and is expected, over time, to be recovered from or returned to customers. as of december 31, 2022, this cumulative difference amounted to $63 million, meaning that the ratemaking method has recognized less in expense than the accounting method since implementation of authoritative guidance for employers' accounting for pensions in 1987, which was offset by a regulatory liability for the current funding level of sce's pension plan. edison international and sce used the following critical assumptions to determine expense for pension and pbop for 2022:
postretirement pension      benefits other
assets2
the discount rate enables edison international and sce to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. edison international and sce select its discount rate by performing a yield
1  curve analysis. this analysis determines the equivalent discount rate on projected cash flows by matching the timing and amount of expected future benefit payments to the corresponding yields from the willis towers watson rate: link 10th - 90th percentile yield curve model on the measurement date.
to determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, current and expected asset allocations are considered, as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets. a portion of pbop trusts asset returns are subject to taxation, so the 3.50% rate of return on plan assets above is determined on an after-tax basis. actual time-weighted, annualized returns on the pension plan assets were (13.4)%,
5.1% and 7.4% for the one-year, five-year and ten-year periods ended december 31, 2022, respectively. actual time-weighted, annualized returns on the pbop plan assets were (18.9)%, 2.1% and 5.8% over these same periods. accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized
3  the health care cost trend rate gradually declines to 5.0% for 2029 and beyond.
as of december 31, 2022, edison international and sce had unrecognized pension gains of $122 million and $131
million, respectively, and unrecognized pbop gains of $869 million and $867 million, respectively. the unrecognized pension and pbop gains primarily consisted of the cumulative impact of the increased discount rates on the respective benefit obligations and the cumulative difference between the expected and actual rate of return on plan assets. of these deferred gains, $139 million of sce's pension gains and $867 million of sce's pbop gains are recorded as regulatory liabilities, respectively, and are expected to refund over the average expected future service of employees. edison international's and sce's pension and pbop plans are subject to limits established for federal tax deductibility. sce funds its pension and pbop plans in accordance with amounts allowed by the cpuc.
executive pension plans have no plan assets.
table of contents effect if different assumptions used.changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates, could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities. the following table summarizes the increase or decrease to projected benefit obligation for pension and the accumulated benefit obligation for pbop if the discount rate were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant:
change to projected benefit obligation          $                  -135    $            158    $           -108    $            126
for pension change to accumulated benefit obligation                              -142                  174                 -141                  173
for pbop a one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would decrease edison international's and sce's current year expense by $33 million and $31 million, respectively, and a one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on pbop plan assets would decrease both edison international's and sce's current year expense by $21 million. contributions to the wildfire insurance fund nature of estimates required.at december 31, 2022, edison international and sce have a $2.2 billion long-term asset and a $204 million current asset reflected as "wildfire insurance fund contributions" in the consolidated balance sheets for the initial $2.4 billion contribution made during 2019 and the present value of annual contributions sce committed to make to the wildfire insurance fund, reduced by amortization. at december 31, 2022, a long-term liability of $536
million has been reflected in "other deferred credits and other long-term liabilities" for the present value of unpaid contribution amounts. contributions were discounted to the present value at the date sce committed to participate in the wildfire insurance fund using us treasury interest rates. management concluded it would be most appropriate to account for the contributions to the wildfire insurance fund similar to prepaid insurance, ratably allocating the expense to periods based on an estimated period of coverage. key assumptions and approach used.the wildfire insurance fund does not have a defined life. instead, the wildfire insurance fund will terminate when the administrator determines that the fund has been exhausted. in 2022, management estimated that the wildfire insurance fund will provide insurance coverage for a period of 15 years from the date sce committed to participate in the wildfire insurance fund. the determination of the correct period in which to record an expense in relation to contributions to the wildfire insurance fund depends, among other factors, on management's assessment of: the future occurrence and magnitude of wildfires; the involvement of sce, or other electrical corporations which could access the wildfire insurance fund, in the ignition of those fires; the probable future outcomes of cpuc cost recovery proceedings for wildfire claims, which may require reimbursement of the fund by electrical corporations;
and the use of the contributions by the administrator of the wildfire insurance fund. further information regarding these factors may become available due to the actions of the fund administrator, or other entities, which could require management to reassess the period of coverage. in estimating the period of coverage, edison international and sce used monte carlosimulations based on eight years (2014 - 2021) of historical data from wildfires caused by electrical utility equipment to estimate expected loss. the details of the operation of the wildfire insurance fund and estimates related to claims by sce, pg&e and sdg&e against the fund have been applied to the expected loss simulations to estimate the period of coverage of the fund. the most sensitive inputs to the estimated period of coverage are the expected frequency of wildfire events caused by investor-owned utility electrical equipment and the estimated costs associated with those forecasted events. these inputs are most affected by the historical data used in estimating expected losses. using a 15-year period (2007 - 2021) of historical data would increase the period of coverage to over 20 years.
table of contents based on information available in the first quarter of 2023 regarding catastrophic wildfires during 2022, sce reassessed its estimate of the life of the wildfire insurance fund. after incorporating 2022 expected losses into the historical data for the monte carlo simulations, sce determined the expected life of the wildfire insurance fund remained 15 years from the date sce committed to participate in the wildfire insurance fund.

risk factors risks relating to edison international edison international's liquidity and ability to pay dividends depends on its ability to borrow funds, access to bank and capital markets, monetization of tax benefits held by edison international, and sce's ability to pay dividends and tax allocation payments to edison international. edison international is a holding company and, as such, it has no material operations of its own. edison international's ability to meet its financial obligations, make investments, and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of sce and sce's ability to make upstream distributions. if sce does not make upstream distributions to edison international and edison international is unable to access the bank and capital markets on reasonable terms, edison international may be unable to continue to pay dividends to its shareholders or meet its financial obligations.
prior to paying dividends to edison international, sce has financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including, among others, debt service and preference stock dividends. further, sce and edison international cannot pay dividends if california law requirements for the declaration of dividends are not met. for information on cpuc and california law requirements related to the declaration of dividends, see "liquidity and capital resources-sce-sce dividends" in the md&a. sce may also owe tax-allocation payments to edison international under applicable tax-allocation agreements.
edison international's ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including its levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. in addition, the factors affecting sce's business will impact edison international's ability to obtain financing. edison international's inability to borrow funds from time to time could have a material effect on edison international's liquidity and operations.
see "risks relating to southern california edison company" below for further discussion.
risks relating to southern california edison company regulatory and legislative risks sce's financial results depend upon its ability to recover its costs and to earn a reasonable rate of return on capital investments in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates.
sce's ongoing financial results depend on its ability to recover its costs from its customers, including the costs of electricity purchased for its customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the cpuc and ferc. sce's financial results also depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-
table of contents equity. sce's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many factors, including the time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers' rates and differences between the forecast or authorized costs embedded in rates (which are set on a prospective basis) and the amount of actual costs incurred.
the cpuc or the ferc may not allow sce to recover costs on the basis that such costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. further, sce may incur expenses before the relevant regulatory agency approves the recovery of such costs. for example, sce has incurred, and expects to further incur, wildfire mitigation expenses and increased labor and material costs due to supply chain constraints and elevated levels of inflation before it is clear whether such costs will be recoverable from customers. also, the cpuc may deny recovery of costs incurred by sce, including uninsured wildfire-related costs, if the cpuc determines that sce was not prudent. for further information on recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs, including costs related to the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events, see "business-southern california wildfires-recovery of wildfire-related costs" and "management overview-southern california wildfires and mudslides" in the md&a. in addition, while sce supports california's environmental goals, it may be prevented from fully executing on its strategy to support such goals by regulatory delay or lack of approval of cost-recovery for the costs of such strategic actions and electrification programs from the relevant regulatory agencies.
sce's authorized return on investment is established by multiplying an authorized rate of return, determined by the cpuc in standalone cost of capital proceedings, by sce's authorized cpuc rate base. sce's cpuc-authorized cost of capital is subject to potential adjustment should interest rates move substantially in years between cost of capital proceedings. for further information on the cost of capital mechanism see "management overview-cost of capital applications" in the md&a.
sce's capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, inflation, commodity price volatility, increasing self-generation, load departures to ccas or electric service providers, and increasing environmental regulations, among other things, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. if customer rates continue to increase, the cpuc may face greater pressure to approve lesser amounts in sce's ratemaking or cost recovery proceedings. to relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the cpuc may authorize lower revenues or increase the period over which sce is allowed to recover amounts, which could impact sce's ability to timely recover its operating costs. for example, in track 3 of the 2021 grc, while the cpuc authorized sce to recover costs through electric rates over a 36-month period, sce may not recover all of its interest expense incurred as a result of financing such costs because the cpuc has only authorized interest accruals on the balances at a short-term rate of interest. if sce is unable to obtain a sufficient rate increase or modify its rate design to recover its costs and an adequate return on capital in rates in a timely manner, its financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.
sce is subject to extensive regulation and the risk of adverse regulatory and legislative decisions, delays in regulatory or legislative decisions, and changes in applicable regulations or legislation.
sce operates in a highly regulated environment. sce's business is subject to extensive federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations. among other things, the cpuc regulates sce's retail rates and capital structure, and the ferc regulates sce's wholesale rates and capital structure. the nrc regulates the decommissioning of san onofre in addition to the local and state agencies that require permits. the construction, planning, siting and operation of sce's power plants, energy storage projects, and transmission lines in california are also subject to regulation by the cpuc and other local, state and federal agencies.
sce must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities, including environmental regulatory authorities, and must abide by their respective rules, regulations and orders. should sce be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement
table of contents actions or impose fines, penalties or disallowances on sce, sce may be prevented from executing its strategy and its business could be materially affected. the process of obtaining licenses and permits from regulatory authorities may be delayed or defeated by opponents and such delay or defeat could have a material effect on sce's business.
to the extent the wildfire insurance fund and other provisions of ab 1054 do not effectively mitigate the significant risk faced by california investor-owned utilities related to liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where utility facilities are a substantial cause, not achieving a more comprehensive solution could have a detrimental effect on sce's business and financial condition. the effectiveness of ab 1054 to mitigate the wildfire-related risk faced by sce is conditioned in part on the performance of oeis and various entities formed under ab 1054 and related legislation to, among other things, administer the wildfire insurance fund, approve wmps, issue safety certifications, oversee and enforce compliance with wildfire safety standards, and develop metrics to reduce risk and measure compliance with risk reduction. in addition, cpuc approval is required to recover the costs sce is incurring to strengthen its wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts described in sce's wmps. see "business-southern california wildfires" and "liquidity and capital resources-sce-regulatory proceedings-wildfire related regulatory proceedings" in the md&a.
in addition, existing regulations may be revised or re-interpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to sce, or its facilities or operations, in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on sce's business or result in significant additional costs. in addition, regulations adopted via the public initiative or legislative process may apply to sce, or its facilities or operations, in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on sce's business or result in significant additional costs.
sce's energy procurement activities are subject to regulatory and market risks that could materially affect its financial condition and liquidity.
sce obtains energy, capacity, environmental credits and ancillary services needed to serve its customers from its own generating plants and through contracts with energy producers and sellers. california law and cpuc decisions allow sce to recover, through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, reasonable procurement costs incurred in compliance with an approved procurement plan. nonetheless, sce's cash flows remain subject to volatility primarily resulting from changes in commodity prices, including as a result of gas supply constraints.
additionally, significant and prolonged gas use restrictions may adversely impact the reliability of the electric grid if critical generation resources are limited in their operations. for further information, see
"business-sce-purchased power and fuel supply." sce is also subject to the risks of unfavorable or untimely cpuc decisions about the compliance with sce's procurement plan and the reasonableness of certain procurement-related costs.
sce may not be able to hedge its risk for commodities on economic terms or fully recover the costs of hedges through the rates it is allowed to charge its customers, which could materially affect sce's liquidity and results of operations, see "market risk exposures" in the md&a.
operating risks damage claims against sce for wildfire-related losses may materially affect sce's financial condition and results of operations.
prolonged drought conditions and shifting weather patterns in california resulting from climate change as well as, among other things, buildup of dry vegetation in areas severely impacted by years of historic drought and lack of adequate clearing of hazardous fuels by responsible parties have increased the duration of the wildfire season and the risk of severe wildfire events.
severe wildfires and increased urban development in high fire risk areas in california have given rise to large damage claims against california utilities for fire-related losses alleged to be the result of utility practices and/or the failure of
table of contents electric and other utility equipment. catastrophic wildfires can occur in sce's service territory even if sce effectively implements its wmps. california courts have previously found utilities to be strictly liable for property damage, regardless of fault, by applying the theory of inverse condemnation when a utility's facilities were determined to be a substantial cause of a wildfire that caused the property damage. the rationale generally stated by these courts for applying this theory to investor-owned utilities is that property losses resulting from a public improvement, such as the distribution of electricity, can be spread across the larger community that benefited from such improvement. however, in november 2017, the cpuc issued a decision denying an investor-owned utility's request to include in its rates uninsured wildfire-related costs arising from several 2007 fires, finding that the investor-owned utility did not prudently manage and operate its facilities prior to or at the outset of the 2007 wildfires. an inability to recover uninsured wildfire-related costs could materially affect sce's business, financial condition and results of operations. for example, if sce is unable to, or believes that it may be unable to, recover damages related to catastrophic wildfires through insurance, the wildfire insurance fund
(which is only available for fires ignited after july 12, 2019) or electric rates, or access the bank and capital markets on reasonable terms, sce may not have sufficient cash or equity to pay dividends or may be restricted from declaring such dividends because it does not meet cpuc or california law requirements related to the declaration of dividends. for information on the california law requirements on the declaration of dividends, see "liquidity and capital resources-sce-sce dividends" in the md&a. also see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12.
commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides."
edison international's and sce's costs of accessing capital markets has increased due to the risks associated with wildfires in southern california. edison international's and sce's access to the bank and capital markets could also be constrained and/or the costs of accessing those markets could increase further as a result of wildfire risk, including if edison international's and/or sce's credit ratings are downgraded or placed on negative watch due to concerns about edison international and/or sce's financial health as a result of wildfires.
sce's insurance coverage for wildfires may not be sufficient.
edison international has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise in connection with sce's ordinary operations. edison international, sce and its contractors may experience coverage reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. no assurance can be given that losses will not exceed the limits of sce's or its contractors' insurance coverage. sce may not be able to recover uninsured losses (including amounts paid for self-insured retention and co-insurance) and increases in the cost of insurance in electric rates. losses which are not fully insured or cannot be recovered through the wildfire insurance fund or electric rates could materially affect edison international's and sce's financial condition and results of operations. for more information on wildfire insurance risk, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides."
sce may not effectively implement its wildfire mitigation plans.
sce will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its service territory if it cannot effectively implement its wmps. for example, sce may not be able to effectively implement its wmps if it experiences unanticipated difficulties relative to sourcing, engaging, and retaining effectively trained contract workers or procuring materials it needs to fulfill its mitigation obligations under the wmps. in addition, if sce does not have an approved wmp, sce will not be issued a safety certification from the cpuc and will consequently not benefit from the presumption of prudency or the ab 1054 liability cap.
the cpuc may assess penalties on sce if it finds that sce has failed to substantially comply with its wmp. in addition, sce may be subject to mandated changes to, or restrictions on, its operational wildfire mitigation practices or be subject to regulatory fines and penalties or claims for damages and reputational harm if sce does not execute its wildfire mitigation practices in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. sce's wildfire mitigation practices
table of contents include psps and using fast-curve settings. in addition, sce may be subject to regulatory fines and penalties or claims for damages and reputational harm if it is determined that sce has placed excessive or unreasonable reliance on psps.
sce establishes the criteria under which it implements psps in its territory. to the extent sce's criteria for implementing psps are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of wildfires during high wind events, sce does not fully implement psps when criteria are met due to other overriding conditions or sce's regulators or others mandate changes to, or restrictions on, its criteria or other operational psps practices, sce will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its territory during high wind events. similarly, if sce is prohibited from implementing its desired fast-curve settings, sce will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its territory.
for more information on ab 1054, see "business-southern california wildfires-recovery of wildfire-related costs-2019 wildfire legislation."
sce will not benefit from all of the features of ab 1054 if the wildfire insurance fund is exhausted.
catastrophic wildfires could rapidly exhaust the wildfire insurance fund and sce will not be reimbursed by the wildfire insurance fund or benefit from the ab 1054 liability cap if the fund has been exhausted as a result of damage claims previously incurred by sce or the other participating utilities.
for more information on ab 1054, see "business-southern california wildfires and mudslides-recovery of wildfire-
related costs-2019 wildfire legislation."
climate change exacerbated weather-related incidents and other natural disasters could materially affect sce's financial condition and results of operations.
weather-related incidents, including storms and events caused, or exacerbated, by climate change, such as wildfires, flooding and debris flows, and other natural disasters such as earthquakes can disrupt the generation and transmission of electricity, and can seriously damage the infrastructure necessary to deliver power to sce's customers. the impacts of climate change continue to evolve and remain dynamic and unpredictable.
climate change has caused, and exacerbated, extreme weather events and wildfires in southern california, and wildfires could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage and operational issues. in addition, the risk of flooding and debris flows occurring as a result of rain may be heightened. for example, the
2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events resulted in, among other things, loss of life, property damage and loss of service. for more information on the impact of the 2017/2018 wildfire/mudslide events on sce and edison international, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides."
extreme heat events can lead to prolonged widespread outages due to, among other things, state-wide capacity supply shortages or equipment failure. extreme weather events can also lead to use of psps. weather-related events, such as debris flows, flooding and melting of a significantly higher than normal snowpack, and earthquakes can cause over-topping or failure at an sce dam resulting in a rapid release of water that could cause, among other things, public safety issues, property damage and operational issues.
weather-related incidents and other natural disasters can lead to lost revenue and increased expense, including higher maintenance and repair costs, which sce may not be able to recover from its customers. these incidents can also result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if sce encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if fire-related losses are found to be the result of utility practices and/or the failure of electric and other utility equipment. in addition, these occurrences could lead to significant claims for damages, including for loss of life and property damage. these occurrences could materially affect sce's business, financial condition and results of
table of contents operations, and the inability to restore power to sce's customers could also materially damage the business reputation of sce and edison international.
for additional information related to climate related risks, see "business-environmental considerations-environmental risks."
the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity are dangerous and involve inherent risks of damage to private property and injury to sce's workforce and the general public.
electricity poses hazards for sce's workforce and the general public should they come in contact with electrical current or equipment, including through energized downed power lines or if equipment malfunctions. in addition, the risks associated with the operation of transmission and distribution assets and power generation and storage facilities include public and workforce safety issues and the risk of utility assets causing or contributing to wildfires.
injuries and property damage caused by such events can subject sce to liability that, despite the existence of insurance coverage, can be significant. in addition, sce may be held responsible for the actions of its contractors. no assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of sce's or its contractors'
insurance coverage. the cpuc has increased its focus on public safety with an emphasis on heightened compliance with construction and operating standards and the potential for penalties being imposed on utilities. additionally, the cpuc has delegated to its staff the authority to issue citations to electric utilities, which can impose fines of up to $100,000 per violation per day (capped at a maximum of $8 million), pursuant to the cpuc's jurisdiction for violations of safety rules found in statutes, regulations, and the cpuc's general orders. the cpuc also can issue fines greater than $8 million outside of the citation program. such penalties and liabilities could be significant and materially affect sce's liquidity and results of operations.
sce's financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage the risks inherent in constructing, operating, and maintaining its facilities and workforce.
sce's infrastructure is aging and could pose a risk to system reliability. sce is also constructing utility owned storage to mitigate possible state-wide capacity shortages in 2023 and later years, and any delays in construction may result in those facilities being unavailable to reduce the impact of any capacity shortages in summer 2023. in addition, as described above, wildfires in sce's service territory can cause significant public safety issues, property damage and operational issues.
in order to mitigate these risks, sce is engaged in a significant and ongoing infrastructure investment program.
this substantial investment program has inherent operational risks and elevates the need for superior execution in sce's activities. sce's financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected if it is unable to successfully manage these risks as well as the risks inherent in constructing, operating, and maintaining its facilities, the operation of which can be hazardous and important for system reliability. sce's inherent operating risks include such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, contractor management, data and records accuracy, public opposition to infrastructure projects, delays, environmental remediation and mitigation costs, difficulty in estimating costs or in recovering costs that are above original estimates, system limitations and degradation, maintaining physical security of workforce and assets, maintaining cybersecurity of data and assets, and delays and interruptions in necessary supplies, including key components necessary for the timely construction of utility owned storage. for example, sce's financial condition may be materially affected as a result of safety incidents, delays, permitting violations and violations of regulatory requirements, among other things, caused by sce's failure to appropriately manage its contractor workforce or from contractual violations by sce's contractors and the inability for sce to recover through contractual indemnities or insurance held by the contractor. sce's financial condition may also be materially affected as a result of data or records inaccuracies, for example inaccurate records could lead to missing or delayed compliance with sce's policies and regulatory requirements, and could contribute to safety incidents. sce's financial condition and results of
table of contents operations could also be materially affected if sce is unable to attract, train and retain a qualified and diverse workforce, including due to the constrained labor market in california and nationally and sce's relations with its unionized workforce. sce's financial condition and results of operations could also be materially affected as a result of atypical resolutions to litigation proceedings arising from its operations, including atypical settlements and verdicts. for instance, sce was subject to an atypical jury verdict in a recent employment litigation matter.
there are inherent risks associated with owning and decommissioning nuclear power generation facilities and obtaining cost reimbursement, including, among other things, insufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust funds, costs exceeding current estimates, execution risks, potential harmful effects on the environment and human health and the hazards of storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials. existing insurance and ratemaking arrangements may not protect sce fully against losses from a nuclear incident.
sce funds decommissioning costs with assets that are currently held in nuclear decommissioning trusts. based upon the financial performance of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund investments, as well as the resolution of a number of other uncertainties, assumptions and estimates, additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust's funds may be required. if additional contributions to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds become necessary, recovery of any such additional funds through electric rates is subject to the cpuc's review and approval.
the costs of decommissioning san onofre are subject to reasonableness reviews by the cpuc. these costs may not be recoverable through regulatory processes or otherwise unless sce can establish that the costs were reasonably incurred. in addition, sce faces inherent execution risks including such matters as the risks of human performance, workforce capabilities, public opposition, permitting delays, and governmental approvals. decommissioning costs ultimately incurred could exceed the current estimates and cost increases resulting from contractual disputes, delays in performance by the contractor, elevated levels of inflation, or permitting delays, among other things, could cause sce to materially overrun current decommissioning cost estimates and could materially impact the sufficiency of trust funds. see "liquidity and capital resources-sce-decommissioning of san onofre" in the md&a.
table of contents even though san onofre is being decommissioned, the presence of spent nuclear fuel still poses a potential risk of a nuclear incident. federal law limits public liability claims from a nuclear incident to the amount of available financial protection, which is currently approximately $13.7 billion for palo verde and $560 million for san onofre. sce and other owners of san onofre and palo verde have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available of $450 million per site. in the case of san onofre, the balance is covered by a us government indemnity.
in the case of palo verde, the balance is covered by a loss sharing program among nuclear reactor licensees. there is no assurance that the cpuc would allow sce to recover the required contribution made pursuant to this loss sharing program in the case of one or more nuclear incidents with claims that exceeded $450 million at a nuclear reactor which is participating in the program. if this public liability limit of $13.7 billion is insufficient, federal law contemplates that additional funds may be appropriated by congress. there can be no assurance of sce's ability to recover uninsured costs in the event the additional federal appropriations are insufficient. for more information on nuclear insurance risk, see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-nuclear insurance."
sce's distribution of water and propane gas on catalina island involves inherent risks of damage to private property and the environment and injury to employees and the general public.
sce owns and operates the water distribution system that serves catalina island, california and a propane gas distribution system that serves the city of avalon on catalina island, california. production, storage, treatment and distribution of water for human use and the transportation, storage, distribution and use of gas can be hazardous, and can cause damage to private property and the environment and injury to employees and the general public if equipment fails or does not perform as anticipated. for example, the risks of operating a water distribution system include the potential for burst pipes and water contamination and the risks of operating gas distribution system include the potential for gas leaks, fire or explosion. the risks related to sce's operation of its water and gas distribution systems may be exacerbated due to aging infrastructure. sce has requested that the cpuc allow sce to include certain water system costs in electric rates and may make similar requests for the water and gas systems in the future. if such requests are denied, significant costs may not be recoverable from customers. in addition, sce may have to pay fines, penalties and remediation costs if it does not comply with laws and regulations in the operation of the water and gas distribution systems. an inability to recover costs associated with any such damages or injuries or any fines, penalties or remediation costs, from insurance or through electric rates, could materially affect sce's business, financial condition and results of operations.
financing risks as a capital-intensive company, sce relies on access to the capital markets. if sce were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its liquidity and operations could be materially affected.
sce regularly accesses the capital markets to finance its activities and is expected to do so by its regulators as part of its obligation to serve as a regulated utility. sce's needs for capital for its ongoing infrastructure investment program are substantial. sce's ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including sce's levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. in addition, the actions of other california investor-owned utilities and legal, regulatory and legislative decisions impacting investor-owned utilities can affect market conditions and therefore, sce's ability to obtain financing. sce's inability to obtain additional capital from time to time could have a material effect on sce's liquidity and operations.
table of contents competitive and market risks sce's inability to effectively and timely respond to the changes that the electricity industry is undergoing, as a result of increased competition, technological advances, and changes to the regulatory environment, could materially impact sce's business model, financial condition and results of operations.
customers and third parties are increasingly deploying distributed energy resources ("ders"), such as solar generation, energy storage, energy efficiency and demand response technologies. california's environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of industry change. this change will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid's capacity to interconnect ders. in addition, enabling california's clean energy economy goals will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options and electric vehicle infrastructure. if sce is unable to effectively adapt to these changes, its business model, its ability to execute on its strategy, and ultimately its financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted.
customer-owned generation and load departures to ccas or electric service providers each reduce the amount of electricity that customers purchase from utilities and have the effect of increasing utility rates unless customer rates are designed to allocate the costs of the distribution grid across all customers that benefit from its use.
for example, some customers in california who generate their own power are not currently required to pay all transmission and distribution charges and non-bypassable charges, subject to limitations, which results in increased costs for those customers who do not own their generation. if regulations aren't changed such that customers pay their share of transmission and distribution costs and non-bypassable charges and the demand for electricity reduces so significantly that sce is no longer effectively able to recover such costs from its customers, sce's business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially impacted.
in addition, the ferc has opened transmission development to competition from independent developers, allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities.
for more information. see "business-sce-competition."
cybersecurity and physical security risks sce's systems and network infrastructure are targets for physical and cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality.
regulators such as nerc and u.s. government agencies, including the departments of defense, homeland security and energy, have increasingly stressed that threat sources continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the u.s. national electric grid and other energy infrastructures, and that such attacks and disruptions, both physical and cyber, are highly sophisticated and dynamic. several u.s. government agencies have highlighted the increasing risks related to physical attacks, ransomware attacks and cybersecurity risks related to the electric sector, including its supply chains, and that the risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions.
sce's operations require the continuous availability of critical information technology systems, sensitive customer and employee data and network infrastructure and information, all of which are targets for malicious actors. new cyber and physical threats arise as sce moves from an analog to a digital electric grid. for example, sce's grid modernization efforts and the move to a network-connected grid increases the number of "threat surfaces" and potential vulnerabilities that an adversary can target. sce system data and architecture are also disclosed, either intentionally or unintentionally, to third parties and the public by regulators, employees, contractors and vendors. this system information may be used by malicious actors to understand sce's systems to prepare for a cyber or physical attack.
table of contents sce depends on a wide array of vendors to provide it with services and equipment. malicious actors may attack vendors to disrupt the services they provide to sce, or to use those vendors as a conduit to attack sce.
additionally, the equipment and material provided by sce's vendors may contain cyber vulnerabilities. a compromise of equipment and/or exfiltration of sce data, whether by physical or by electronic means, could result in loss or changes to confidential or sensitive electronic data, loss of intellectual property and interruption of business processes. while some of sce's vendors have experienced cybersecurity incidents, such incidents have not, to sce's knowledge, resulted in a material impact to sce to date.
sce's systems have experienced, and will continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents involving attacks of malicious code, unauthorized access attempts, and other illicit activities, but to sce's knowledge it has not experienced a material cybersecurity or data breach to date. though sce actively monitors developments in this area, no security measures can completely shield its systems, infrastructure and data from cyber attacks, intrusions or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality.
if sce's information technology and operational technology systems' security measures were to be breached, or a critical system failure were to occur without timely recovery, sce could be unable to fulfill critical business functions, such as delivery of electricity to customers, and/or sensitive confidential personal and other data could be compromised, which could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, material financial loss to sce or to its customers, loss of confidence in sce's security measures, customer dissatisfaction, and significant litigation and/or regulatory exposure, all of which could materially affect sce's financial condition and results of operations and materially damage the business reputation of edison international and sce.
risks relating to edison international and southern california edison company edison international's and sce's financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted by events, like the covid-19 pandemic, that cause significant disruption to workforces, supply chains, economies, or societies on a regional, statewide, national or global basis.
edison international and sce could be materially and adversely impacted by events, such as the widespread outbreak of a communicable disease, that result in, among other things, significant disruption to supply chains, economies, societies or workforces on a regional, statewide, national or global basis. for example, the global spread of covid-19, which was declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020, created significant uncertainty, volatility and disruption globally and has impacted the operations of edison international and sce.
many of the risks and uncertainties identified in this form 10-k are, and will be, exacerbated by the impacts of an event like a pandemic and the actions being taken by governmental entities, businesses, individuals and others in response to such an event. for example, sce may be unable to effectively execute its psps program due to, among other things, requests from local and state authorities not to shut off the power during a pandemic or other event, and thereby may increase the risk of sce equipment being associated with the ignition of wildfires.
in addition, impacts of a pandemic or similar event on sce's customers and third parties could also result in sce facing, among other things, significant reductions in demand for electricity and payment delays and/or defaults from customers which could result in significant under-collections. in addition, edison international and sce could also face payment delays and/or defaults from insurers and other counterparties. furthermore, edison international's and sce's access to the bank and capital markets could also be constrained and/or the costs of accessing those markets could increase as a result of a pandemic or similar event, including if edison international's and/or sce's credit ratings are downgraded, or placed on negative watch due to concerns about edison international and/or sce's financial health as a result of the impacts of the pandemic. sce may also incur significant incremental costs as a result of actions it is taking in response to a pandemic or a similar event, including costs being incurred to maintain its operations and assist its employees who are required to telework or are otherwise impacted by the event. sce could also face delays in important legal and
table of contents regulatory proceedings. these impacts, among others, could materially and adversely impact edison international's and sce's business, operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial results.
edison international's and sce's business activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region.
edison international's and sce's business activities are concentrated in the electric utility industry. edison international's principal subsidiary, sce, serves customers only in southern and central california. as a result, edison international's and sce's future performance may be affected by events and economic factors unique to california or by regional regulation, legislation or judicial decisions. for example, california courts have applied strict liability to investor-owned utilities in wildfire and other litigation matters. see "notes to consolidated financial statements-note 12. commitments and contingencies-contingencies-southern california wildfires and mudslides."

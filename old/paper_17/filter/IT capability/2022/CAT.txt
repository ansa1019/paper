item 1a.risk factors.
the statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and the "notes to consolidated financial statements" of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data" to this form 10-k.  in addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this form 10-k, including in part ii, item 7 "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," include "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results.  forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook.  you can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "estimate," "anticipate," "will be," "should," "plan," "forecast," "target," "guide," "project," "intend," "could" and similar words or expressions.
forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance.  should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected.
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. you should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the sec on form 10-q or form 8-k.
the following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material to our business. in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
macroeconomic risks our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.
our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve.  the demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. a prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges.  economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment.  slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
the energy, transportation, and mining industries are significant adopters of caterpillar products. in these industries customers are likely to base their purchase decisions upon expected future commodity dynamics, including price. commodity prices, especially in the post-covid period, have experienced frequent volatility. volatility in these markets may be abrupt and unpredictable in response to global economic conditions, government actions, regulatory changes, supply/demand dynamics, innovation, and commodity substitutions among others. economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may reduce capital expenditures in response to a variety of the aforementioned conditions. reduction in these capital expenditures may lead to decreased demand for caterpillar products and services as well as aftermarket parts as customers may choose to extend preventative maintenance and delay overhauls when possible.
the rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results.  our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.
catastrophic events, including global pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.
the occurrence of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics (including the covid-19 pandemic), cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could adversely affect our employees, our systems, our ability to produce and distribute our products, and our reputation. for example, the covid-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. such measures have included travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. these measures have impacted and may continue to impact all or portions of our workforce and operations and the operations of our customers, dealers and suppliers. although certain restrictions related to the covid-19 pandemic have eased, uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures. current material and component shortages, logistics constraints and labor inefficiencies have limited and could continue to limit our ability to meet customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.
the covid-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and customer demand uncertainty, has caused inflationary pressure in the u.s. and elsewhere and has led to volatility in customer demand for the company's products and services and caused supply chain disruptions. economic uncertainties could continue to affect customer demand for the company's products and services, the value of the equipment financed or leased, the demand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers.
a catastrophic event resulting in the destruction or disruption of our workforce, our systems, our ability to produce and distribute our products, any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and our operating results or cash flows. the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event, such as the covid-19 pandemic.
commodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products and services, significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of labor and material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.
we are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.
we rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products. production challenges at suppliers (including suppliers of semiconductors), a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. on the other hand, in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer. additionally, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience transportation delays for parts, components and finished machines due to capacity constraints and congestion at ports throughout the globe although the situation has improved compared to recent periods. our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if significant transportation delays interfere with deliveries, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis.
changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results.
most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that support these activities.  interest rate changes may also affect our customers' ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products. increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies.
central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. the impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, create supply chain inefficiencies and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
changes in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.
government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business.  throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, rail systems, airports, sewer and water systems, waterways and dams.  tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the after-tax returns on business activity and investment, both of which influence investment decisions.  unfavorable developments, such as decisions to reduce public spending or to increase taxes, could negatively impact our results.
our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.
our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the u.s. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty. some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others. our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, fuel costs (e.g., diesel, bunker, jet), limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. operating in different regions and countries exposes us to numerous risks, including:
•multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;
•imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints;
•imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas;
•withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements;
•imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the u.s. or foreign governments;
•political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.
the occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
operational risks the success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers' needs.
our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products.  to achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, oems and end-user customers.  this is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships; our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.  in addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations.  failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights; to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.
we operate in a highly competitive environment.  we compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price.  there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies' products.  thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors' new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.
lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers' behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
in addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales.
increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.
we rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. additionally, we collect and store sensitive information relating to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers and employees. operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. information technology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication. cybersecurity attacks from threat actors globally range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products.  it is possible that our information technology systems and networks, or those managed or provided by third parties, could have vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. while various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing, or which we cause or have caused third-party service providers to implement, will be sufficient to protect and mitigate associated risks to our systems, information or other property.
we have experienced cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers, and we have experienced viruses and attacks targeting our information technology systems and networks. such prior events, to date, have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. due to the evolving nature of such security threats, the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. further, the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack.
in addition, data we collect, store and process are subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws and regulations, such as the european union's general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act, which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance.
our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our oem customers.
we sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices.  both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates.  such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively.  if the inventory levels of our dealers and oem customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and oem customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand.
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.
in pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. we often compete with others for the same opportunities. to be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through due diligence, among other things, there may be risks and liabilities that our due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess. we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following:
•the failure to achieve the acquisition's revenue or profit forecast;
•the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;
•unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents;
•we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions;
•faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process;
•unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems;
•higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including information technology systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting;
•we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business;
•higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and
•we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.
many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and attention. they may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.
in order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements.  such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures.  if we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.
failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. in the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. these divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses following the transaction, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements.  lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results.
union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates.  there can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions or our employees.  we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire.  if we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions.  in addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future.  we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. a work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
unexpected events may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.
the occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the united states or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.  natural disasters, pandemic illness, such as covid-19, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of our products to dealers, end-users and distribution centers.  existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.
financial risks disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.
continuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs.  global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain customers, dealers and suppliers. an inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. furthermore, changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.
in addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers' ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers' decreased access to capital. if capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers' liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.
failure to maintain our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.
each of caterpillar's and cat financial's costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies.  these ratings are based, in significant part, on each of caterpillar's and cat financial's performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting.  there can be no assurance that caterpillar and cat financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings. we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies.  a downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect caterpillar's and cat financial's liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market.  there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for cat financial or an available source of short-term financing for caterpillar. an inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.
our financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.
cat financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales. the inability of cat financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
continuing to meet cat financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. cat financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium-term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. if global economic conditions were to deteriorate, cat financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature. cat financial also could be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. however, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be sufficient or even available under extreme market conditions. any of these events could negatively impact cat financial's business, as well as our and cat financial's results of operations and financial condition.
market disruption and volatility may also lead to numerous risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:
•market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could increase cat financial's write-offs and provision for credit losses.
•the process cat financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management's judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans.  financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments.
•cat financial's ability to engage in routine funding transactions or to borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.
•as cat financial's borrowing agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of our underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.
changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect cat financial's and our earnings and/or cash flow.
changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on cat financial's and our earnings and cash flows. while interest rates had remained at historically low levels in recent years, the federal reserve board significantly increased the federal funds rate in 2022 and has indicated that it expects continued increases in interest rates in 2023 and 2024 to combat rising inflation in the u.s. because a significant number of the loans made by cat financial are made utilizing fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. certain loans made by cat financial and various financing extended to cat financial are made at variable rates that use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.
libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform. on july 27, 2017, the united kingdom's financial conduct authority ("fca") announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021. immediately following the libor publication on december 31, 2021, ice benchmark administration ("iba") ceased the publication of all gbp, eur, chf and jpy libor settings, as well as the one-week and two-month usd libor tenors. on november 30, 2020, iba, with the support of the united states federal reserve and the fca, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of all other remaining usd libor tenors on june 30, 2023. while the november 30 announcement extended the transition period to june 2023, the united states federal reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new usd libor issuances by the end of 2021. further, on march 15, 2022, the consolidated appropriations act of 2022, which includes the adjustable interest rate (libor) act, was signed into law in the u.s. this legislation establishes a uniform benchmark replacement process for financial contracts maturing after june 30, 2023 that do not contain clearly defined or practicable fallback provisions. the legislation also creates a safe harbor that shields lenders from litigation if they choose to utilize a replacement rate recommended by the federal reserve. the alternative reference rate committee, a committee convened by the federal reserve that includes major market participants, has identified the secured overnight financing rate, or sofr, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for libor. at this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to sofr or other alternative reference rates as the transition away from the libor benchmarks is anticipated in coming years. there continue to be uncertainties regarding the transition from libor, including but not limited to the need to renegotiate certain terms of our loan agreements with libor as the referenced rate, which could require us to incur significant expense and may subject us to disputes or litigation over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the replacement reference rates.
the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of libor-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to cat financial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities, loans and financial instruments. cat financial created a cross-functional team that assesses risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of libor in securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. other changes in market interest rates may influence cat financial's borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts. cat financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. there can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. if any of the variety of instruments and strategies cat financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows. with respect to insurance services' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings.
an increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of cat financial customers could adversely affect its results.
inherent in the operation of cat financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. the creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer's management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on cat financial's and our earnings and cash flows. cat financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis. however, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in cat financial's estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on cat financial's and our earnings and cash flows.
currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.
we conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.  we are subject to currency-exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues.  fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in u.s. dollars.  there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. in addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into u.s. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.
restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.
we maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities).  the agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries, including cat financial.  these covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder's equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. cat financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each december 31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.
a breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. these consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.
sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.
we maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. we use many assumptions in determining our future payment obligations under the plans. significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return on pension investments being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements. we may be required to make material contributions to our pension plans in the future and may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law. these factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business and overall financial condition.
legal & regulatory risks our global operations are subject to a wide-range of trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.
due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations. these include u.s. regulations issued by customs and border protection, the bureau of industry and security, the office of antiboycott compliance, the directorate of defense trade controls and the office of foreign assets control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  any alleged or actual violations may subject us to increased government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the united states.  furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the u.s. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject. we also cannot predict in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
in addition, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  our operations outside the united states, including in developing countries, expose us to the risk of such violations. violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, intermediaries acting on our behalf, or our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions. violations may also disrupt our business, and may result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
international trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.
government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries.  the implementation of more restrictive trade policies (such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry) in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  for example, a government's adoption of "buy national" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous other jurisdictions. our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between u.s. and non-u.s. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates. in addition, our future results of operations could also be adversely affected by changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-u.s. jurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. if our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. for information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see note 6 - "income taxes" and note 22 - "environmental and legal matters" of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data" to this annual report on form 10-k.
costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. we face risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. we are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business.  the industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims.  it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period.
the global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. in addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves. such payments could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.
new regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact caterpillar and cat financial.
cat financial's operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. in the united states, for example, certain cat financial activities are subject to the u.s. dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (dodd-frank), which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. as a result, cat financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on cat financial's and our results of operations and financial condition. changes in regulations or additional regulations in the united states or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on cat financial's and our results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.
our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise, air, releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. the potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.
environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments. uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. if environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our reputation, business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.
the company's amended and restated bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the company and its shareholders, which could discourage claims or limit the ability of the company's shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the shareholders as more favorable for disputes with the company or the company's directors, officers or other employees.
the company's amended and restated bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless the company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the company to the company or the company's shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the company or any director or officer or other employee of the company arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or the company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time) or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the company or any director or officer or other employee of the company governed by the internal affairs doctrine.
the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws could limit our shareholders' ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the company or its directors, officers or other employees. alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the company's amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. the exclusive forum provision in the company's amended and restated bylaws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, or the securities act of 1933, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

overview our sales and revenues for 2022 were $59.427 billion, an increase of $8.456 billion, or 17 percent, compared with $50.971 billion for 2021. the increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro, australian dollar and japanese yen. profit per share was $12.64 in 2022, compared with profit per share of $11.83 in 2021. profit was $6.705 billion in 2022, compared with $6.489 billion in 2021. the increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs, a goodwill impairment charge, higher selling, general and administrative (sg&a) and research and development (r&d) expenses, lower mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other postemployment benefit (opeb) plans and higher restructuring costs.
trends and economic conditions outlook for key end markets in construction industries, we see positive momentum in 2023 for north america. we expect non-residential construction in north america to grow due to the positive impact of government-related infrastructure investments, healthy backlogs and rental replenishment. residential construction continues to moderate due to tightening financial conditions but remains at a healthy level. in asia pacific, excluding china, we expect growth due to public infrastructure spending and supportive commodity prices. we expect continued weakness in china in the excavator industry above 10-tons, which we anticipate to remain below 2022 levels due to low construction activity. in eame, business activity is expected to be about flat versus 2022 based on healthy backlogs and strong construction demand in the middle east, offset by uncertain economic conditions in europe. construction activity in latin america is expected to be flat to slightly down versus a strong 2022 performance.
in resource industries, we expect healthy mining demand to continue as commodity prices remain above investment thresholds; however, customers continue to remain capital disciplined. we anticipate production and utilization levels will remain elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to gain momentum. we expect the continuation of high equipment utilization and a low level of parked trucks, which support future demand for our equipment and services. the energy transition is expected to support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing opportunities for profitable growth. in heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we anticipate continued growth supported by infrastructure and major non-residential construction projects.
in energy & transportation, we expect sales growth due to strong order rates in most applications. in oil & gas, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continued strength in demand and order intake for the year. new equipment orders for solar turbines continue to be robust. power generation orders are expected to remain healthy, including data center strength. industrial remains healthy with momentum continuing for 2023. in rail, north america new locomotives are expected to remain muted. we anticipate strength in high-speed marine as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets.
company trends and expectations for the full-year 2023, we expect sales to increase compared to 2022, supported by favorable price realization. although we expect stronger sales of equipment to end users in 2023, we do not anticipate a significant change in dealer inventory by year end. 2023 sales are expected to follow a more traditional seasonal pattern, with first quarter being the lowest of the year. demand remains strong given the robust order backlog and improving supply chain dynamics. in addition, services momentum is expected to continue this year as we continue to execute our services growth strategy.
we expect sales to increase in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by favorable price realization and slightly stronger sales volume, which reflects higher sales of equipment to end users. we expect a seasonal build in dealer inventory in the first quarter of 2023. sales should increase across the three primary segments in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022.
we expect operating profit to increase in 2023, compared to 2022. pricing actions from 2022 will continue to impact 2023 and we will evaluate future actions as appropriate to offset inflationary pressures. we currently expect to see moderation of price realization and input cost inflation throughout 2023. price realization is expected to more than offset manufacturing costs for 2023. increases in sg&a/r&d expenses are expected to exceed the benefit of lower short-term incentive compensation expense in 2023 as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives such as services growth and technology, including digital, electrification and autonomy. we anticipate higher pension expense within other income (expense) in 2023, compared to 2022, due to higher interest costs from higher interest rates. this non-cash item is estimated to be just over $300 million for the full year, or about $80 million per quarter. finally, the strengthening of the u.s. dollar in 2022 acted as a benefit to profit within other income (expense), which would not re-occur if the weakening we have seen in rates continues.
global business conditions we continue to monitor a variety of external factors around the world, such as supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost and labor pressures. areas of particular focus include certain components, transportation and raw materials. transportation shortages have resulted in delays and increased costs. in addition, our suppliers are dealing with availability issues and freight delays, which could impact production in our facilities. contingency plans have been developed and continue to be modified to minimize supply chain challenges that may impact our ability to meet increasing customer demand. we continue to assess the environment and are taking appropriate price actions in response to rising costs.

2022 compared with 2021
consolidated sales and revenues the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2021 (at left) and 2022 (at right). caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's board of directors and employees.
total sales and revenues for 2022 were $59.427 billion, an increase of $8.456 billion, or 17 percent, compared with $50.971 billion in 2021. the increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro, australian dollar and japanese yen. the increase in sales volume was driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories, increased services and higher sales of equipment to end users. dealers increased their inventories about $2.4 billion in 2022, compared to a decrease of about $100 million in 2021.
north america sales increased 29 percent driven by favorable price realization, the impact from changes in dealer inventories, increased services and higher sales of equipment to end users. dealers increased inventories during 2022, compared to a decrease during 2021.
sales increased 33 percent in latin america due to higher sales of equipment to end users, favorable price realization and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. dealers increased inventories more during 2022 than during 2021.
eame sales increased 6 percent due to favorable price realization, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and higher sales of equipment to end users, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro and british pound. dealers increased inventories more during 2022 than during 2021.
asia/pacific sales increased 2 percent driven by favorable price realization, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and higher services, partially offset by lower sales of equipment to end users and unfavorable currency impacts related to the australian dollar and japanese yen. dealers increased their inventories during 2022, compared to remaining about flat during 2021.
dealers increased their inventories about $2.4 billion in 2022, compared to a decrease of about $100 million in 2021. dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. delivery times can vary based on availability of product from caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. we expect dealer inventories to be about flat in 2023 compared to 2022.

consolidated operating profit the chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2021 (at left) and 2022 (at right). caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's board of directors and employees. the bar entitled other includes consolidating adjustments and machinery, energy & transportation other operating (income) expenses.
operating profit was $7.904 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.026 billion, or 15 percent, compared with $6.878 billion in 2021. the increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, a goodwill impairment charge, higher sg&a/r&d expenses and higher restructuring costs.
unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher material costs, freight and manufacturing inefficiencies. the increase in sg&a/r&d expenses was driven by investments aligned with the company's strategy for profitable growth, which included services growth and technology, such as digital, electrification and autonomy, as well as higher short-term incentive compensation expense.
short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. expense for 2022 was about $1.4 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in 2021. for 2023, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $1.1 billion.
in 2022, the company took a goodwill impairment charge of $925 million and restructuring costs of $193 million related to the rail division, both primarily non-cash items. $180 million of the total rail restructuring costs were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022. the goodwill impairment charge is related to a lower outlook for the company's locomotive offerings. the restructuring costs were primarily related to write-downs in the value of inventory.
operating profit margin was 13.3 percent in 2022, compared with 13.5 percent in 2021.

•interest expense excluding financial products in 2022 was $443 million, compared with $488 million in 2021. the decrease was due to lower average debt outstanding during 2022, compared with 2021.
other income (expense) in 2022 was income of $1.291 billion, compared with income of $1.814 billion in 2021. the change was primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of opeb plans, lower pension and opeb income and unrealized losses on marketable securities, partially offset by higher investment and interest income.
•the provision for income taxes for 2022 reflected an annual effective tax rate of 23.2 percent, compared with 22.9 percent for 2021, excluding the discrete items discussed below.
on september 8, 2022, the company reached a settlement with the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) that resolves all issues for tax years 2007 through 2016, without any penalties. the company's settlement includes, among other issues, the resolution of disputed tax treatment of profits earned by caterpillar sarl (csarl) from certain parts transactions. we vigorously contested the irs's application of the "substance-over-form" or "assignment-of-income" judicial doctrines and its proposed increases to tax and imposition of accuracy related penalties. the settlement does not include any increases to tax in the united states based on those judicial doctrines and does not include any penalties. the final tax assessed by the irs for all issues under the settlement was $490 million for the ten-year period. this amount was primarily paid in 2022 along with the associated interest of $250 million. the settlement was within the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and enables us to avoid the costs and burdens of further disputes with the irs. as a result of the settlement, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $41 million in 2022 to reflect changes in estimates of prior years' taxes and related interest, net of tax. we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs, and tax years 2017 to 2019 are currently under examination.
the provision for income taxes also included the following:
◦a tax charge of $124 million related to $606 million of pension and opeb mark-to-market gains in 2022, compared to a $190 million tax charge related to $833 million of mark-to-market gains in 2021.

liquidity and capital resources sources of funds we generate significant capital resources from operating activities, which are the primary source of funding for our me&t operations. funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. financial products' operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. during 2022, we had positive operating cash flow within both our me&t and financial products' operations. on a consolidated basis, we ended 2022 with $7.00 billion of cash, a decrease of $2.25 billion from year-end 2021. in addition, me&t has invested in available-for-sale debt securities that are considered highly liquid and are available for current operations. these securities are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets in the consolidated statement of financial position and were $1.48 billion at the end of december 31, 2022. we intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position.
consolidated operating cash flow for 2022 was $7.77 billion, up $568 million compared to 2021. the increase was primarily due to higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items and decreased working capital requirements. within working capital, changes in receivables, customer advances and accrued expenses favorably impacted cash flow, but were partially offset by changes in accounts payable. partially offsetting these items were higher payments for short-term incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2022 as well as higher cash taxes paid which includes payments related to settlements with the u.s. internal revenue service.
total debt as of december 31, 2022 was $36.99 billion, a decrease of $796 million from year-end 2021. debt related to me&t decreased $174 million in 2022. debt related to financial products decreased by $617 million due to portfolio funding requirements.
we have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (credit facility) available in the aggregate to both caterpillar and cat financial for general liquidity purposes. based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the credit facility available to me&t as of december 31, 2022 was $2.75 billion. information on our credit facility is as follows:
•in september 2022, we entered into a new 364-day facility. the 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $825 million is available to me&t) expires in august 2023.
•in september 2022, we amended and restated the three-year facility (as amended and restated, the "three-year facility"). the three-year facility of $2.73 billion (of which $715 million is available to me&t) expires in august 2025.
•in september 2022, we amended and restated the five-year facility (as amended and restated, the "five-year facility"). the five-year facility of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to me&t) expires in september 2027.
at december 31, 2022, caterpillar's consolidated net worth was $15.93 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the credit facility.  the consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholders' equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
at december 31, 2022, cat financial's covenant interest coverage ratio was 2.36 to 1.  this was above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the credit facility.
in addition, at december 31, 2022, cat financial's six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.05 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.21 to 1.  this was below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each december 31, required by the credit facility.
in the event caterpillar or cat financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the credit facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. additionally, in such event, certain of cat financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings.  at december 31, 2022, there were no borrowings under the credit facility.
our total credit commitments and available credit as of december 31, 2022 were:
(millions of dollars)                           consolidated                       machinery,                     financial energy &amp;                      products transportation credit lines available:
global credit facilities                      $10,500                           $2,750                         $7,750
other external                                  3,649                              158                          3,491
total credit lines available                   14,149                            2,908                         11,241
less: utilized credit                           (982)                              (3)                          (979)
available credit                               $7,712                           $2,905                         $4,807
the other consolidated credit lines with banks as of december 31, 2022 totaled $3.65 billion. these committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements.  caterpillar or cat financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.
we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. moody's, fitch and s&p maintain a "mid-a" debt rating. a downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. in the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, me&t's operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from cat financial and access to our committed credit facilities. our financial products' operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of cat financial, and potential borrowings from caterpillar. in addition, we maintain a support agreement with cat financial, which requires caterpillar to remain the sole owner of cat financial and may, under certain circumstances, require caterpillar to make payments to cat financial should cat financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios.
we facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs (the "programs") through participating financial institutions. the programs are available to a wide range of suppliers and allow them the option to manage their cash flow. we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the programs. the range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the programs. the amounts payable to participating financial institutions for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the programs and included in accounts payable in the consolidated statement of financial position were $862 million and $822 million at december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively. the amounts settled through the programs and paid to participating financial institutions were $5.4 billion and $4.1 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. we account for payments made under the programs, the same as our other accounts payable, as a reduction to our cash flows from operations. we do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.
material cash requirements for contractual obligations we believe our balances of cash and cash equivalents of $7.00 billion and available-for-sale debt securities of $1.48 billion as of december 31, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.
we have committed cash outflows related to postretirement benefit obligations, long-term debt and operating lease agreements. see notes 12, 14 and 20, respectively, of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data" for additional information.
we have short-term obligations related to the purchase of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. these consist of invoices received and recorded as liabilities as of december 31, 2022, but scheduled for payment in 2023 of $8.69 billion. in addition, we have contractual obligations for material and services on order at december 31, 2022, but not yet invoiced or delivered, of $7.64 billion.
we also have long-term contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements; systems support, software licenses and development contracts; information technology consulting contracts and outsourcing contracts for benefit plan administration. these obligations total $1.06 billion, with $537 million due in the next 12 months.
machinery, energy & transportation net cash provided by operating activities was $6.36 billion in 2022, compared with $7.18 billion in 2021. the decrease was primarily due to payments for short-term incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2022, higher payments for taxes which includes payments related to settlements with the u.s. internal revenue service and increased working capital requirements in 2022. within working capital, changes in accounts payable unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in customer advances and accounts receivable. partially offsetting these items were higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items.
net cash used for investing activities in 2022 was $1.81 billion, compared with net cash used of $1.23 billion in 2021. the change was primarily due to decreased activity related to intercompany lending with financial products and was partially offset by decreases in net investment activity.
net cash used for financing activities during 2022 was $6.80 billion, compared with net cash used of $6.30 billion in 2021. the change was primarily due to higher share repurchases in 2022 and the absence of proceeds from debt issuance which occurred in 2021. these items were partially offset by lower repayments of maturing debt in 2022.
while our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-a rating. next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. additional information on cash deployment is as follows:
strong financial position - our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-a rating. we track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies.
operational excellence and commitments - capital expenditures were $1.30 billion during 2022, compared to $1.13 billion in 2021. we expect me&t's capital expenditures in 2023 to be around $1.5 billion. we made $346 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans during 2022. in comparison, we made $340 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2021. we expect to make approximately $372 million of contributions to our pension and opeb plans in 2023.
fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders - we intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity to fund targeted investments that drive long-term profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings and services, including acquisitions.
as part of our capital allocation strategy, me&t free cash flow is a liquidity measure we use to determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. we define me&t free cash flow as cash from me&t operations less capital expenditures, excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions and cash payments related to settlements with the u.s. internal revenue service. a goal of our capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all me&t free cash flow to shareholders over time in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our mid-a rating.
our share repurchase plans are subject to the company's cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company and the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets. the timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and investing priorities. in july 2018, the board of directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of caterpillar common stock (the 2018 authorization) effective january 1, 2019, with no expiration. in may 2022, the board approved a new share repurchase authorization (the 2022 authorization) of up to $15.0 billion of caterpillar common stock effective august 1, 2022 with no expiration. utilization of the 2022 authorization for all share repurchases commenced on august 1, 2022, leaving $70 million unutilized under the 2018 authorization. in 2022, we repurchased $4.23 billion of caterpillar common stock, with $12.8 billion remaining under the 2022 authorization as of december 31, 2022. caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of december 31, 2022 were approximately 516 million.
each quarter, our board of directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. the board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. in december 2022, the board of directors approved maintaining our quarterly dividend representing $1.20 per share and we continue to expect our strong financial position to support the dividend. dividends paid totaled $2.44 billion in 2022.
financial products financial products operating cash flow was $1.52 billion in 2022, compared with $1.42 billion in 2021. net cash used for investing activities was $356 million in 2022, compared with $1.40 billion used in 2021. the change was primarily due to portfolio related activity partially offset by lower proceeds from disposal of equipment. net cash used for financing activities was $964 million in 2022, compared with net cash provided of $257 million in 2021. the change was primarily due to lower portfolio funding requirements.
off-balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees. information related to guarantees appears in note 21 - "guarantees and product warranty" of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see note 1j - "new accounting guidance" of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. the more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. we have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. we review these assumptions at least annually with the audit committee of the board of directors. following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.
residual values for leased assets - we determine the residual value of cat financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value. we estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends. we also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.
upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third-party, in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price.
during the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  for operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis. for finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.
we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. when a triggering event occurs, we perform a test for recoverability by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. if the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, we measure the fair value of the equipment on operating leases in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value.
at december 31, 2022, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $1.71 billion. without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10 percent non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $80 million of additional annual depreciation expense.
fair values for goodwill impairment tests - we test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.
we review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. for reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired. if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss.
for reporting units where we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. we compute the residual value using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. a reporting unit's discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant's perspective. the estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. we categorize the fair value determination as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.
our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill, with the exception of our rail reporting unit.
the rail reporting unit is a part of our energy & transportation segment. rail's product portfolio includes diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services. the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated that the fair value of rail was below its carrying value. accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $925 million, resulting in a full impairment of rail's goodwill balance as of october 1, 2022. there was a $36 million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge. the valuation of the rail reporting unit was based on estimates of future cash flows, which assumed a reduced demand forecast, lower margins due to continued inflationary cost pressures, and a discount rate approximately 140 basis points higher than utilized in the prior year valuation. the reduction in the demand forecast in the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily driven by fourth quarter commercial developments, resulting in a lower outlook for the company's locomotive offerings.
an unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. the demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. the energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the mineral extraction, oil and natural gas industries. decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. we would report a goodwill impairment as a non-cash charge to earnings.
warranty liability - at the time we recognize a sale, we record estimated future warranty costs.  we determine the warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory.  generally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside north america).  we develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.  warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.
product liability and insurance loss reserve - we determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. the amount of these reserves totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. the majority of the balance in both 2022 and 2021 consisted of unearned insurance premiums.
postretirement benefits - we sponsor defined benefit pension plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement healthcare and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. there are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. the actuarial assumptions we use may change or differ significantly from actual results, which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. we utilize a mark-to-market approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.
•we use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today's dollars. the u.s. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, december 31. the benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing caterpillar's projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate aa bonds available on the measurement date. we use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-u.s. plans. in estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. this approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates. a decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and expense.
•the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets. this rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. for example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. a decrease in the rate would increase our expense. the expected return on plan assets is based on the fair value of plan asset allocations as of our measurement date, december 31.
•we use the expected rate of compensation increase to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. it represents average long-term salary increases. this rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies. an increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense.
•the assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate. an increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense.
•we use the mortality assumption to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants. an increase in the life expectancy of plan participants will result in an increase in our obligation and expense.

post-sale discount reserve - we provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. we have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. the most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. the amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  the reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. we adjust the reserve if discounts paid differ from those estimated. historically, those adjustments have not been material.
allowance for credit losses - the allowance for credit losses is management's estimate of expected losses over the life of our finance receivable portfolio calculated using loss forecast models that take into consideration historical credit loss experience, current economic conditions and forecasts and scenarios that capture country and industry-specific economic factors. in addition, we consider qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models, including borrower-specific and company-specific factors. these qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.
we measure the allowance for credit losses on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we determine that similar risk characteristics do not exist. we identify finance receivables for individual evaluation based on past due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. the allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable.  in determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. we also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees.
while management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. if the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses.
income taxes - we are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate.  these tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation.  in establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.  our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law.  future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received.
despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. we record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management's evaluation of the information available at the reporting date.  to be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits.  the benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.  significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement.  adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes.  adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.
deferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns.  certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  in making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of u.s. gaap earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  we give less weight in this analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and opeb plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes.
additional information related to income taxes is included in note 6 - "income taxes" of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
other matters information related to legal proceedings appears in note 22-environmental and legal matters of part ii, item 8 "financial statements and supplementary data."
retirement benefits we recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and opeb plans. mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on mark-to-market gains and losses.

•expected increase in expense in 2023 compared to 2022 - excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses, our net periodic benefit cost is expected to increase $273 million in 2023. this expected increase is primarily due to higher interest cost in 2023 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2022 (u.s. pension plans discount rate for 2023 interest cost is 5.2 percent compared to 2.3 percent for 2022) which is partially offset by higher expected return on plan assets in 2023 (u.s. pension plans expected return on plans assets is 5.8 percent for 2023 compared to 4.0 percent in 2022).
•increase in expense in 2022 compared to 2021 - primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains in 2022 compared to 2021 and higher interest cost in 2022 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2021.
•decrease in expense in 2021 compared to 2020 - primarily due to mark-to-market gains in 2021 compared to mark-to-market losses in 2020 and lower interest cost in 2021 as a result of lower discount rates at year-end 2020.
the primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses (gains) for 2022, 2021 and 2020 are described below. we include the net mark-to-market losses (gains) in other income (expense) in the results of operations.
•2022 net mark-to-market gain of $606 million - primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2022 compared to the end of 2021. this was partially offset by a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (u.s. pension plans had an actual loss rate of (22.6) percent compared to an expected rate of return of 4.0 percent).
•2021 net mark-to-market gain of $833 million - primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2021 compared to the end of 2020. this was partially offset by various assumption changes and a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (u.s. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 3.6 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 4.2 percent).
•2020 net mark-to-market loss of $383 million - primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2020 compared to the end of 2019. this was partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (u.s. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 16.7 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.1 percent).
sensitivity foreign exchange rate sensitivity me&t operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the u.s. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our me&t operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2023 cash flow for our me&t operations by approximately $98 million. last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $89 million adverse impact on 2022 cash flow.  we determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. we multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.
in managing foreign currency risk for our financial products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies, a 10 percent change in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the u.s. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year.
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. in addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the u.s. dollar. in reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the australian dollar, chinese yuan, mexican peso, indian rupee and euro.
interest rate sensitivity for our me&t operations, we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances.  a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2023 pre-tax earnings of me&t. last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2022 pre-tax earnings.
for our financial products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. we have a match-funding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within a predetermined range on an ongoing basis. in connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the finance receivable portfolio. match funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.
in order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, financial products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. all on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. the primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. an analysis of the december 31, 2022 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2023 pre-tax earnings.  last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2022 pre-tax earnings.
this analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate.
non-gaap financial measures we provide the following definitions for the non-gaap financial measures used in this report. these non-gaap financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by u.s. gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies.  management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures.
we believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of three significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. these items consist of (i) goodwill impairment, (ii) restructuring costs and (iii) pension and opeb mark-to-market (gains) losses resulting from plan remeasurements. we do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-gaap measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aid with assessing our period-over-period results. in addition, we provide a calculation of me&t free cash flow as we believe it is an important measure for investors to determine the cash generation available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.

supplemental consolidating data we are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis.  we have grouped the data as follows:
consolidated - caterpillar inc. and its subsidiaries.
machinery, energy & transportation - we define me&t as it is presented in the supplemental data as caterpillar inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding financial products. me&t's information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.
financial products - we define financial products as it is presented in the supplemental data as our finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily caterpillar financial services corporation (cat financial) and cat insurance holdings inc. (insurance services). financial products' information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of caterpillar and other equipment.
consolidating adjustments - eliminations of transactions between me&t and financial products.
the nature of the me&t and financial products businesses is different, especially with regard to the financial position and cash flow items. caterpillar management utilizes this presentation internally to highlight these differences. we believe this presentation will assist readers in understanding our business.
pages 51 to 53 reconcile me&t and financial products to caterpillar inc. consolidated financial information. certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

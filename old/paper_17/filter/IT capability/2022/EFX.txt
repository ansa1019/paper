item 1a. risk factors all of the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this form 10-k should be considered and read carefully. the risks described below are not the only ones facing us. the occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. this form 10-k also contains forward-looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.
technology and data security risks security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could compromise company, consumer and customer information, interfere with our operations, cause us to incur significant costs for remediation and enhancement of our it systems and expose us to legal liability, all of which could have a substantial negative impact on our business and reputation.
we are a global data, analytics and technology company. in the ordinary course of business, we collect, process, transmit and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information of consumers, employees and strategic partners. the secure operation of our information technology networks and systems, and of the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. because our products and services involve the storage and transmission of personal information of consumers, we are routinely the target of attempted cyber and other security threats by outside third parties, including technically sophisticated and well-resourced bad actors attempting to access or steal the data we store. additionally, we could experience service disruptions or a loss of access to critical data or systems due to ransomware or other destructive attacks. insider or employee cyber and security threats are also a significant concern for all companies, including ours. despite our substantial investment in physical and technological security measures, employee training and contractual precautions, our information technology networks and infrastructure (or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers) are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access to data, loss of access to systems or breaches of confidential information due to criminal conduct, attacks by hackers, employee or insider malfeasance and/or human error.
the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and often are not recognized until launched against a target, or even some time after. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventative measures or remediate any intrusion on a timely or effective basis even if our security measures are appropriate, reasonable, and/or comply with applicable legal requirements. certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect. further, we are in the process of transforming our applications and infrastructure technologies, and this transition to cloud-based technologies may expose us to additional cyber threats as we migrate our data from our legacy systems to cloud-based solutions hosted by third parties. although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and expect to continue to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections, these security measures cannot provide absolute security.
in 2017, we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of personal information of u.s., canadian and u.k. consumers. if we experience additional significant breaches of our security measures, including from incidents that we fail to detect for a period of time, sensitive data may be accessed, stolen, disclosed or lost. any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could subject us to significant litigation, regulatory fines or penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. we cannot ensure that our insurance policies in the future will be adequate to cover losses from any security breaches.
security breaches and attacks, and the adverse publicity that may follow, can have a negative impact on our reputation and our relationship with our customers. for example, our reputation with consumers and other stakeholders and our customer relationships were damaged following the 2017 cybersecurity incident, resulting in a negative impact on our revenue for a period of time. if we experience another material cybersecurity incident or are otherwise unable to demonstrate the security of our systems and the data we maintain and retain the trust of our customers, consumers and data suppliers, we could experience a substantial negative impact on our business.
if we fail to achieve and maintain key industry or technical certifications, our customers and business partners may stop doing business with us and we may not be able to win new business, which would negatively affect our revenue.
we are required by customers and business partners to obtain various industry or technical certifications. such certifications are critical to our business because certain of our current and potential customers and the contracts governing certain customer relationships, as well as certain of our data suppliers, require us to maintain them as a requirement of doing business. for example, as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we lost certain key certifications which caused certain customers and business partners to stop or pause doing business with us and temporarily limited our ability to win new business. we had to spend significant resources on remediation activities in order to obtain these key re-certifications. if we fail to achieve or maintain key industry or technical certifications as a result of another cybersecurity incident or for other reasons, customers and business partners may stop doing business with us and we may not be able to win new business, which would negatively affect our revenue.
strategy and market demand risks the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our technology transformation strategy could adversely impact our business and financial results.
we expect our technology transformation strategy, including our transition to cloud-based technologies, will significantly increase our efficiency, our productivity, and the stability and functionality of our products and services, as well as decrease the cost of our overall systems infrastructure, all of which we expect will drive growth and have a positive effect on our business, competitive position and results of operations. this initiative is a major undertaking as we replace many of our previous operating systems with cloud-based systems. this complex, multifaceted and extensive initiative is expensive and has caused, and may cause in the future, unanticipated problems and expenses. if the transition causes errors or adversely impacts system processes, our new systems do not operate as expected, or the data we transition to the cloud changes in a material way, we may have to incur significant additional costs to make modifications and could lose customers and we may suffer reputational harm as a result. moreover, we may experience issues with customer migration, as many of our customers may not migrate to cloud-based technologies on a timely basis or at all or may choose not to utilize our products and services during and after our transition to cloud-based technologies, which could negatively impact our revenue.
we cannot assure you that our technology transformation strategy will be beneficial to the extent, or within the timeframes expected, or that the estimated efficiency, cost savings and other improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all. market acceptance of cloud-based offerings is affected by a variety of factors, including information security, reliability, performance, the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in certain geographies, customer and data provider concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage its data as well as the customer's ability to access this data once a contract has expired, and consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers. if we are unable to correctly respond to these issues, we may experience business disruptions, damage to our reputation, negative publicity, diminished customer trust and relationships and other adverse effects on our business. even if the anticipated benefits and savings are substantially realized, there may be consequences, internal control issues or business impacts that were not expected. our transition and migration to cloud-based technologies may increase our risk of liability and cause us to incur significant technical, legal, regulatory or other costs.
the loss of access to credit, employment, financial and other data from external sources could harm our ability to provide our products and services.
we rely extensively upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data received from customers, licensors, furnishers, strategic partners and various government and public record sources. this data includes the widespread and voluntary contribution of credit data from most lenders in the u.s. and many other markets as well as the contribution of data under proprietary contractual agreements, such as employers' contribution of employment and income data to the work number® and telecommunications, cable and utility companies' contribution of payment and fraud data to the national cable, telecommunications and utility exchange. for a variety of reasons, including concerns of data furnishers arising out of legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use, security breaches or competitive reasons, our data sources could withdraw, delay receipt of or increase the cost of the data they provide to us. where we currently have exclusive use of data, the providers of the data sources could elect to make the information available to competitors. we also compete with several of our third-party data suppliers. if a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation, if we lose exclusive right to the use of data, or if the collection, disclosure or use of data becomes uneconomical, our ability to provide products and services to our customers could be adversely affected, which could result in decreased revenue, net income and earnings per share and reputational loss. there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable.
negative changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, the level of inflation, unemployment rates, income, home prices, investment values and consumer confidence, could adversely affect us.
our customers, and therefore our business and revenues, are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, including the demand and availability of affordable credit and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, the level of inflation, employment levels, consumer confidence and housing demand, both inside and outside the united states. business customers use our credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards, automobile loans, home and equity loans and other consumer loans, and to manage their existing credit relationships. demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity, which can be impacted by changes in interest rates and the level of inflation. banks' and other lenders' willingness to extend credit are adversely affected by elevated consumer delinquency and loan losses in a weak economy. consumer demand for credit (i.e., rates of spending and levels of indebtedness) also tends to grow more slowly or decline during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth.
our customer base suffers when financial markets experience volatility, illiquidity and disruption, and the potential for increased and continuing disruptions going forward presents considerable risks to our business and revenue. high or rising rates of unemployment and interest, declines in income, home prices or investment values, lower consumer confidence and reduced access to credit adversely affect demand for many of our products and services, and consequently our revenue and results of operations, as consumers may postpone or reduce their spending and use of credit, and lenders may reduce the amount of credit offered or available.
in 2023, we expect u.s. mortgage market originations to decline by approximately 30% compared to 2022. any weakening in the u.s. mortgage market resulting in a significant reduction in mortgage originations could have a corresponding negative impact on revenue and operating profit for our business, primarily within the workforce solutions and usis operating segments. to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect our financial position and profitability.
our markets are highly competitive and new product introductions and pricing strategies being offered by our competitors could decrease our sales and market share or require us to enhance our products and services or reduce our prices in a manner that reduces our revenue and operating margins.
we operate in a number of geographic, product and service markets that are highly competitive. competitors may develop products and services that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. new competitors may choose to enter and compete in our markets, or existing competitors may choose to introduce new products and enter markets that we serve and that they do not currently serve. the size of our competitors varies across market segments, as do the resources we have allocated to the segments we target. therefore, some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources than we do in one or more of our market segments, or overall. as a result, our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may devote greater resources than we can to the development, enhancement, promotion, sale and support of products and services, or some of our customers may develop products of their own that replace the products they currently purchase from us, which would result in lower revenue. in addition, many of our competitors have extensive consumer relationships, including relationships with our current and potential customers. moreover, new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share, revenue or margins.
we also sell our information to competing firms, and buy information from certain of our competitors, in order to sell "tri-bureau" and other products, most notably into the u.s. mortgage market. changes in prices between competitors for this information and/or changes in the design or sale of tri-bureau versus single or dual bureau product offerings may affect our revenue or profitability.
some of our competitors may choose to sell products that compete with ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability, or may be able to sell products competitive to ours at lower prices, individually or as a part of integrated suites, given proprietary ownership of data, technological superiority or economies of scale. price reductions by our competitors could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins and results of operations and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms. historically, certain of our key products have experienced declines in per unit pricing due to competitive factors and customer demand. since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, information technology and development and other costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough to changes in competition or customer demand, we could experience further reductions in our operating margins.
if our relationships with key customers are materially diminished or terminated, our business could suffer.
we have long-standing relationships with a number of our customers, many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time. many of our material customer agreements can be terminated by the customer for convenience on limited advance written notice, which provides our customers with the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to award more business to our competitors. there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements, maintain relationships with any of our customers or business partners on acceptable terms or at all, or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers or business partners. the loss of one or more of our major customers or business partners could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if we do not introduce successful new products, services and analytical capabilities in a timely manner, or if the market does not adopt our new services, or if new technologies are introduced by competitors that are more effective or at lower costs than ours, our competitiveness and operating results will suffer.
we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, including the introduction of new innovative technologies, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. in addition, certain of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. without the timely introduction of new technologies, products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. the success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to properly identify customer needs; innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications; successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner; produce and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time; differentiate our offerings from competitor offerings; price our products competitively; anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and control product quality in our product development process. our resources have to be committed to any new products and services before knowing whether the market will adopt the new offerings.
the demand for some of our products and services may be negatively impacted to the extent the availability of free or less expensive consumer information increases.
public or commercial sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer credit, credit score and other information have become increasingly available, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. in addition, governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access and these or other sources of free or relatively inexpensive consumer information from competitors or other commercial sources may reduce demand for our services. recently, there also has been an increase in companies offering free or low-cost direct-to-consumer credit services (such as credit scores, reports and monitoring) as part of alternative business models that use such services as a means to introduce consumers to other products and services. to the extent that our customers choose not to obtain services from us and instead rely on information obtained at no cost or relatively inexpensively from these other sources, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
we rely, in part, on acquisitions, joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business and expand our geographic reach. the acquisition, integration or divestiture of businesses by us may not produce the expected financial or operating results or it and data security profile we expect. in addition, if we are unable to make acquisitions or successfully develop and maintain joint ventures and other alliances, our growth may be adversely impacted.
historically, we have relied, in part, on acquisitions, joint ventures and other alliances to grow our business. any transaction we do complete may not be on favorable terms, may involve greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, potential impairments of tangible and intangible assets or significant write-offs and the expected benefits, synergies, revenue and growth from these initiatives may not materialize as planned. we may have difficulty assimilating new businesses and their products, services, technologies, it systems and personnel into our operations. it and data security profiles of acquired companies may not meet our technological standards and may take longer to integrate and remediate than planned. this may result in significantly greater transaction, remediation and integration costs for future acquisitions than we have experienced historically, or it could mean that we will not pursue certain acquisitions where the costs of integration and remediation are too significant. we may also have difficulty integrating and operating businesses in geographies and markets or market segments where we do not currently have a significant presence, and acquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside of the u.s. will increase our exposure to risks of conducting operations in international markets. these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and workforce, increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
despite our past experience, opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions, joint ventures and other alliances may not be available to us in the future. in addition, our focus on data security and our technology transformation strategy, including our migration to cloud-based technologies, may limit our ability to identify and complete acquisitions as our stringent technological criteria and standards for acquisition candidates may continue to increase.
if our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.
we derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to u.s. federal, state and local governments and their respective agencies. we also derive a portion of our revenue from sales to foreign governments and related agencies. such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments or suspension of future government contracting. a number of our federal government contracts have received enhanced scrutiny and media attention due to the sensitive nature of the data we handle and due to the importance of the government programs we support. if we experience another material cybersecurity incident, if public or legislative scrutiny and pressure related to government services we support turns negative or if we experience uptime issues or performance problems, our ability to maintain existing or acquire new government contracts may be substantially impacted.
if our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, if the services we provide are no longer needed due to government program change or termination, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, including by our failure to achieve certain government certifications, our business could suffer.
our business has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, including the covid-19 pandemic.
we face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks. for example, the covid-19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts by governments to attempt to control its spread adversely impacted the global economy, leading to reduced consumer spending and lending activities. our customers, and therefore our business and revenues, are sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions. we experienced significant revenue declines in several of our markets as a result of covid-19 and we may experience similar revenue declines as a result of future health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks.
our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by esg matters and/or our reporting of such matters.
there is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance ("esg") matters, both in the united states and internationally. we communicate certain esg-related initiatives, goals, and/or commitments regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments, and other matters, on our website, in our filings with the sec, and elsewhere. these initiatives, goals, or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. for example, in 2021, we announced our commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, the achievement of which relies, in large part, on the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions around the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon based energy sources and technologies, the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards, and other factors. we could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our net zero 2040 commitment or other esg-related initiatives, goals or commitments. in addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals or commitments, or for any revisions to them. to the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about esg matters increase, we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of such disclosures. our actual or perceived failure to achieve our esg-related initiatives, goals or commitments could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.
operational risks our technology transformation strategy places a significant strain on our management, operational, financial and other limited resources.
as part of our technology transformation strategy, we are transitioning and migrating our data systems from traditional, on premises data centers to cloud-based platforms. this initiative places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, internal financial controls and reporting function. in addition, many of our existing personnel have limited experience with native cloud-based technologies. this effort has been, and will continue to be, time consuming and costly. our technology transformation strategy requires management time and resources to educate employees and implement new ways of conducting business. the dedication of resources to our technology transformation strategy and cloud-based technologies limits the resources we have available to devote to other initiatives or growth opportunities, or to invest in the maintenance of our existing internal systems. we cannot guarantee that our strategy is the right one or that investments in alternative technologies or other initiatives would not be a better use of our limited resources.
additionally, as a result of our cloud migration efforts in connection with our technology transformation strategy, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods. reorganization and transition can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating activities and growing our business. if we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these activities, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our transition to cloud-based technologies could expose us to operational disruptions.
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed internally within the company and some of which are outsourced to third parties. as part of our technology transformation strategy, we are upgrading a significant portion of the information technology systems used to operate our business and replacing them with cloud-based solutions. this transition will continue to require substantial changes to our software and network infrastructure, which could lead to system interruptions, affect our data systems and further expose us to operational disruptions, and cause us to lose customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
upon implementation of the new cloud-based solutions, much of our information technology systems will consist of outsourced, cloud-based infrastructure, platform and software-as-a-service solutions not under our direct management or control. any disruption to either the outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced supplier could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems and could impair our ability to provide services to our customers. we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions.
our customers' decisioning may be adversely affected if we provide inaccurate or unreliable data, which could adversely affect our financial condition, cause loss of customer trust and contribute to non-compliance with certain laws and regulations.
data accuracy is an essential component of data quality and is the foundation of our business model. accurate data increases predictive ability and improves confidence in decisions for our customers. inaccurate or unreliable data could adversely affect customer decisioning and poses reputational, compliance and financial risk to our company. although we have developed internal processes and controls to maintain and continually improve data accuracy, these processes and controls cannot ensure absolute accuracy and the complexity of our technology transformation may introduce additional risk until it is completed. we have experienced data accuracy issues, including errors in connection with our technology transformation. to date, none of these issues have had a material impact on our operations or financial results. however, any future data accuracy issues arising during the technology transformation or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations, including through the incurrence of additional costs or the loss of customers and harm to our reputation.
if our systems do not meet customer requirements for response time or high availability, or we experience system constraints or failures, or our customers do not migrate to the cloud or modify and/or upgrade their systems to accept new releases of our products and services, our services to our customers could be delayed or interrupted, which could result in lost revenues or customers, lower margins, service level penalties or other harm to our business and reputation.
our customers expect high system availability and response time performance, as well as a very high degree of system resilience. we depend on reliable, stable, efficient and uninterrupted operation of our technology network, systems, and data centers to provide service to our customers. many of the services and systems upon which we rely have been outsourced to third parties. in addition, many of our revenue streams are dependent on links to third party telecommunications providers. these systems and operations, and the personnel that support, service and operate these systems, could be exposed to interruption, damage or destruction from power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, denial-of-service or other cyber attacks, employee or insider malfeasance, human error, fire, natural disasters, war, terrorist acts or civil unrest. we may not have sufficient disaster recovery or redundant operations in place to cover a loss or failure of systems or telecommunications links in a timely manner, which may be exacerbated by any delays in obtaining equipment due to supply chain or other impacts.
in addition, as part of our technology transformation, we are seeking to migrate our customers from traditional data platforms to cloud-based products and services. many of our customers may not migrate to cloud-based technologies on a timely basis or at all, or may choose not to utilize our products and services during and after our transition to cloud-based technologies. if our customers' timelines prevent them from migrating to cloud-based technologies quickly enough, they will remain on our legacy infrastructure, which could expose them to system availability, response time and performance issues.
any significant system interruption or series of minor interruptions could result in the loss of customers and/or lost revenues, lower margins, service level penalties or other significant harm to our business or reputation.
dependence on outsourcing certain portions of our operations may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.
as part of our technology transformation, we have outsourced various components of our application development, information technology, operational support and administrative functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. if our outsourcing vendors fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels including with respect to data and system security, or increase prices for their services to unreasonable levels, our ability to bring products to market and support our customers and our reputation could suffer. any failure to perform on the part of these third-party providers could impair our ability to operate effectively and could result in lower future revenue, unrealized efficiencies and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition. some of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.
our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.
our future success, including our ability to implement our technology transformation strategy, depends partly on the continued service of our key development, sales, marketing, executive and administrative personnel. increased retention risk exists in certain key areas of our operations, such as it and data security, which require specialized skills, such as migrating legacy computer systems to the cloud, data security expertise and analytical modeling. additionally, the worker shortage that emerged following the outbreak of covid-19 has presented increased challenges to our ability to develop, retain and attract qualified personnel. if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. as part of our technology transformation strategy, we have hired or contracted with a significant number of new employees and contract workers. hiring, on-boarding training, motivating, retaining and managing employees with the skills required is time-consuming and expensive. there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees. if we are not able to hire sufficient employees to support our business, including our technology transformation, or to train, motivate, retain and manage the employees we do hire, it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results.
global operational risks economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
sales outside the u.s. comprised 22% of our total revenue in 2022. as a result, our business is subject to various risks associated with doing business internationally and these risks may differ in each jurisdiction where we operate depending on the particular product or service we offer in the jurisdiction. in addition, many of our employees, suppliers, job functions and facilities are located outside the u.s. accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors including:
•changes in specific country or region political, economic or other conditions;
•data privacy and consumer protection laws and regulations;
•differing labor, intellectual property protection and technology standards and regulations;
•business licensing requirements or other requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from entering certain markets, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;
•difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner;
•implementation of exchange controls;
•geopolitical instability, including terrorism and war, including the russia-ukraine war;
•foreign currency changes;
•increased travel, infrastructure, legal and compliance costs of multiple international locations;
•foreign laws and regulatory requirements;
•terrorist activity, natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophic events;
•restrictions on the import and export of technologies;
•difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;
•failure to meet quality standards for outsourced work;
•the presence and acceptance of varying level of business corruption in international markets; and
•varying business practices in foreign countries.
we earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including among others the british pound, the australian dollar, the canadian dollar, the argentine peso, the chilean peso, the euro, the new zealand dollar, the costa rican colon, the singapore dollar, the brazilian real and the indian rupee. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenue, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against major currencies will affect our operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against major currencies, may materially affect our consolidated financial results.
compliance with applicable u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, such as anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other similar restraints, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by our employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur.
legal and regulatory risks as part of a global settlement, we entered into agreements with various parties to settle the u.s. consumer mdl litigation and certain federal and state government investigations arising out of the 2017 cybersecurity incident. if we are unable to comply with our obligations under these agreements, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
in july 2019, the company entered into multiple agreements that resolve the u.s. consolidated consumer class action cases, captioned in re: equifax, inc. customer data security breach litigation, mdl no. 2800 (consumer cases) (the "u.s. consumer mdl litigation"), and the investigations of the ftc, the cfpb, the attorneys general of 48 states, the district of columbia and puerto rico (the "msag group") and the nydfs (collectively, the "consumer settlement") relating to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. the consumer settlement became effective on january 11, 2022.
as part of the consumer settlement, we agreed to implement certain business practice commitments related to consumer assistance and our information security program, including third party assessments of our program. these business practice commitments are extensive and require a significant amount of attention from management. to the extent we are unable to comply or we are viewed as not being in compliance with these business practice commitments or other requirements of a relevant order, we could face an enforcement action or contempt proceeding that could potentially result in fines, penalties and new business practice commitments, which, depending on the amount and type, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
in addition, we may be required to deposit additional amounts in the consumer settlement fund under certain circumstances if the fund is insufficient to cover claims and certain expenses. while we do not believe that we will be required to deposit additional amounts into the consumer settlement fund based on our claims experience to date, we could be obligated to fund up to an additional $125 million if our claims experience changes and the consumer fund is exhausted.
we and our customers are subject to various current laws and governmental regulations, and could be affected by new and evolving consumer privacy and cybersecurity or other data-related laws or regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses and change our business practices, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
we are subject to a number of u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy, cybersecurity, data and financial protection. see "item 1. business-governmental regulation" in this form 10-k for a summary of the u.s. and foreign consumer and data protection laws and regulations to which we are subject. these regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time, and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that could harm our business. in addition, new laws and regulations at the state and federal level are enacted or considered frequently. examples of such new and evolving laws and regulations include amendments to the fcra, cybersecurity and other requirements promulgated by the ftc and new york department of financial services, the ccpa which took effect on january 1, 2020, and amendments to which took effect on january 1, 2023, the california data broker registration requirements that took effect on january 31, 2020, the cpra taking effect on january 1, 2023 and privacy laws in virginia, colorado, connecticut and utah which have taken, or will take effect, in 2023. furthermore, we expect there to be an increased focus on laws and regulations related to our business, including by the current u.s. presidential administration and the u.s. congress, because of the growing policy concerns in the u.s. with regard to the operation of credit reporting agencies, the collection, use, accuracy, correction and sharing of personal information, and the use of algorithms, artificial intelligence and machine learning in business processes.
there are a number of legislative proposals pending before the u.s. congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning privacy or cybersecurity that could affect us. the canadian government has initiated a review of consumer privacy laws, and several u.s. states have introduced varying comprehensive privacy laws modeled to some degree on the ccpa and/or the gdpr. compliance with multiple state laws containing varying requirements could be complicated and costly. in europe, although the gdpr already includes certain provisions relating to the automated processing of personal data, there has also been discussion of new legislative proposals to regulate business use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies which, if enacted, could impose new legal requirements addressing among other issues, privacy, discrimination and human rights. the specifics of such legislation and the number of jurisdictions that will introduce legislation in this area remain unclear at this time. in addition, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements in the event that consumer information is accessed or acquired by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy and security of such data are possible. in the u.s., state laws provide for disparate notification regimes, all of which we are subject to. further, any perception that our practices or products are an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current or future regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, private class actions, reputational harm, or claims by regulators, which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability.
we devote substantial compliance, legal and operational business resources to strive for compliance with applicable regulations and requirements. in the future, we may be subject to significant additional expenses related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including new laws and evolving interpretations that are difficult to predict, and to the investigation, defense or remedy of actual or alleged violations. additionally, we cooperate with cfpb supervisory examinations and respond to other state, federal and foreign government examinations of or inquiries into our business practices. the enactment of new laws and how they are interpreted could impact our business. in particular, legislative activity in the privacy area may result in new laws that are applicable to us and that may hinder our business, for example, by restricting use or sharing of consumer data, including for marketing or advertising or limiting the use of, limiting our ability to provide certain consumer data to our customers, or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence and machine learning, including the use of algorithms and automated processing in ways that could materially affect our business, or which may lead to significant increases in the cost of compliance. any failure by us to comply with, or remedy any violations of, applicable laws and regulations, could result in new costs for our operations, the curtailment of certain of our operations, the imposition of fines and penalties, liability to private plaintiffs as a result of individual or class action litigation, restrictions on the operation of our business and reputational harm. it is difficult to predict the impact on our business if we were subject to allegations of having violated existing laws. for example, in europe, the gdpr, which includes extensive regulations for certain security incidents, could result in fines of up to four percent of annual worldwide "turnover" (a measure similar to revenues in the u.s.). in addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold to customers in various industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. moreover, our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation depend in part on customers' adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with consumer expectations and regulatory requirements. we cannot predict the ultimate impact on our business of new or proposed rules, supervisory examinations or government investigations or enforcement actions.
the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a substantial negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations:
•amendment, enactment or interpretation of laws and regulations that restrict the access, sharing and use of personal information and reduce the availability or effectiveness of our solutions or the supply of data available to customers;
•changes in cultural and consumer attitudes in favor of further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions;
•failure of data suppliers or customers to comply with laws or regulations, where mutual compliance is required;
•failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and
•failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost effective manner.
these laws and regulations (as well as actions that may be taken by legislatures and regulatory bodies in other countries) and the consequences of any violation could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in, impose additional costs on us, result in significant loss of revenue, result in significant restitution and fines, impact the value of assets we hold, or otherwise adversely affect our business.
the cfpb has supervisory and examination authority over our business and may initiate enforcement actions with regard to our compliance with federal consumer financial laws.
the cfpb, which was established under the dodd-frank act and commenced operations in july 2011, has broad authority over our business. this includes authority to issue regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as under the fcra and other laws applicable to us and our financial customers. the cfpb is authorized to prevent "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices" through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority.
the cfpb conducts examinations and investigations, issues requests for information and subpoenas and brings civil actions in federal court for violations of the federal consumer financial laws, including the fcra. in these proceedings, the cfpb can seek relief that includes: rescission or reformation of contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, payment of damages, limits on activities and civil money penalties of up to $1.0 million per day for known violations. the cfpb conducts periodic examinations of us and the consumer credit reporting industry, which could result in new regulations or enforcement actions or proceedings. actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services, making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer them.
although we have committed resources to enhancing our compliance programs, actions by the cfpb or other regulators against us could result in financial or reputational harm. our compliance costs and legal and regulatory exposure could increase materially if the cfpb or other regulators enact new regulations, change regulations that were previously adopted, modify through supervision or enforcement past regulatory guidance, or interpret existing regulations in a manner different or stricter than have been previously interpreted.
regulatory oversight of our contractual relationships with certain of our customers may adversely affect our business.
the federal banking agencies, including the office of the comptroller of the currency, the federal deposit insurance corporation, the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the cfpb, as well as many state banking agencies have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with third-party relationships, which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity, by contract or otherwise, and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider's business arrangement with third-party service providers, and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their third-party relationships. this guidance requires more rigorous oversight of third-party relationships that involve certain "critical activities." in light of this guidance, our existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance may continue to revise their third-party risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with us, which may adversely affect our relationships with such customers and/or increase our expenses in servicing such customers.
we are regularly involved in claims, suits, government investigations, supervisory examinations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.
we are regularly involved in claims, suits, government investigations, supervisory examinations and regulatory proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to consumer protection and data protection, including purported class action lawsuits. such claims, suits, government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of their outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel, and other factors. in addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm, liability, penalties or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, or requiring a change in our business practices, products or technologies, which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. the fcra contains an attorney fee shifting provision that provides an incentive for consumers to bring individual and class action lawsuits against a credit reporting agency for violation of the fcra, and the number of consumer lawsuits (both individual and class action) against us alleging a violation of the fcra and our resulting costs associated with resolving these lawsuits have increased substantially over the past several years.
third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
there has been substantial litigation in the u.s. regarding intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. from time to time, third parties may make claims that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. we analyze and take action in response to each such claim on a case by case basis. a dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property can be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the inherent uncertainty of intellectual property litigation, could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations, and we may not prevail. a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or providing commercial leverage for negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. in certain of our businesses we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all. although our policy is to obtain licenses or other rights where necessary, we cannot provide assurance that we have obtained all required licenses or rights.
third parties may misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.
our success increasingly depends on our proprietary technology and its ability to differentiate us from our competitors. we rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, database rights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as contract restrictions, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. the extent to which such rights can be protected varies in different jurisdictions. if we do not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results. our pending patent and trademark applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights. in addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.
we may need to devote significant resources to monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect misappropriation or infringement by third parties. our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect misappropriation or infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. in some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because a third party has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. in addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue.
financial market risks a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital markets.
credit ratings reflect an independent agency's judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. the ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower's industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company's cash flows to changes in the economy. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be changed or withdrawn at any time by the assigning rating agency.
a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowings under our commercial paper program, $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and $700.0 million delayed draw term loan, and could limit or, in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt. in addition, the market's demand for, and thus our ability to readily issue, new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment.
our retirement and post-retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.
we have significant retirement and post-retirement pension plan assets and obligations. the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses, expected returns, and funding obligations. significant decreases in interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of equifax inc. md&a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k. this section discusses the results of our operations for the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021 and the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. all percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for each of the periods presented.
as used herein, the terms equifax, the company, we, our and us refer to equifax inc., a georgia corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only equifax inc.
all references to earnings per share data in md&a are to diluted earnings per share, or eps, unless otherwise noted. diluted eps is calculated to reflect the potential dilution that would occur if stock options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in additional common shares outstanding.
business overview equifax inc. is a global data, analytics and technology company. we provide information solutions for businesses, governments and consumers, and we provide human resources business process automation and outsourcing services for employers. we have a large and diversified group of clients, including financial institutions, corporations, government agencies and individuals. our services are based on comprehensive databases of consumer and business information derived from numerous sources including credit, financial assets, telecommunications and utility payments, employment, income, educational history, criminal history, healthcare professional licensure and sanctions, demographic and marketing data. we use advanced statistical techniques, machine learning and proprietary software tools to analyze available data to create customized insights, decision-making and process automation solutions and processing services for our clients. we are a leading provider of e-commerce fraud and charge back protection services in north america as well as information and solutions used in payroll-related and human resource management business process services in the u.s. for consumers, we provide products and services to help people understand, manage and protect their personal information and make more informed financial decisions. additionally, we also provide information, technology and services to support debt collections and recovery management.
we currently operate in four global regions: north america (u.s. and canada), asia pacific (australia, new zealand and india), europe (the united kingdom ("u.k."), spain and portugal) and latin america (argentina, chile, costa rica, dominican republic, ecuador, el salvador, honduras, mexico, paraguay, peru and uruguay). we maintain support operations in the republic of ireland, chile, costa rica and india. we also have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in cambodia, malaysia and singapore and have an investment in a consumer and commercial credit information company in brazil. we previously had a joint venture in russia that offered consumer credit services; however, during the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of this equity method investment.
recent events and company outlook as further described above, we operate in the u.s., which represented 78% of our revenue in 2022, and internationally in 24 countries. our products and services span a wide variety of vertical markets including financial services, mortgage, talent solutions, federal, state and local governments, automotive, telecommunications, e-commerce and many others.
demand for our services tends to be correlated to general levels of economic activity and to consumer credit activity, small commercial credit and marketing activity, identity and fraud, and employee hiring and onboarding activity. demand is also enhanced by our initiatives to expand our products, capabilities and markets served.
for 2023, our planning assumes that u.s. economic activity, as measured by gdp, is expected to grow but at a slower rate of growth than experienced in 2022. our plan assumes the u.s. mortgage market, as measured by originations, is expected to decline by about 30% in 2023 versus 2022. the u.s. mortgage market, particularly the mortgage refinance portion of the u.s. mortgage market, can be significantly impacted by u.s. interest rates and therefore mortgage rates. in the international markets in which we operate, in particular in australia, the u.k. and canada, our planning also assumes economic activity, as measured by gdp, to grow in 2023 but at slower rates than in 2022. the slowdown in economic activity in the u.k. is expected to be more significant than in australia or canada.
segment and geographic information segments. the workforce solutions segment consists of the verification services and employer services business lines. verification services revenue is transaction-based and is derived primarily from employment and income verification, as well as criminal justice data. employer services revenue is derived from our provision of certain human resources business process outsourcing services that include both transaction and subscription based product offerings. these include services that assist employers in complying with and automating certain payroll-related and human resource management processes throughout the entire cycle of the employment relationship, including unemployment cost management, employee screening, employee onboarding, tax credits and incentives, i-9 management and compliance, immigration case management, tax form management services and affordable care act management services. workforce solutions has established operations in canada, australia and most recently in the u.k.
the usis segment consists of three service lines: online information solutions, mortgage solutions, and financial marketing services. online information solutions and mortgage solutions revenue is principally transaction-based and is derived from our sales of products such as consumer and commercial credit reporting and scoring, identity management, fraud detection, modeling services and consumer credit monitoring services. usis also markets certain decisioning software services which facilitate and automate a variety of consumer and commercial credit-oriented decisions. online information solutions also includes the u.s. consumer credit monitoring solutions business previously part of the global consumer services segment. financial marketing services revenue is principally project and subscription based and is derived from our sales of batch credit, identity and consumer wealth information such as those that assist clients in acquiring new customers, cross-selling to existing customers and managing portfolio risk. usis operates in the united states.
the international segment consists of asia pacific, europe, latin america and canada. canada's services are similar to our usis offerings. asia pacific, europe and latin america are made up of varying mixes of service lines that are generally consistent with those in our usis reportable segment. we also provide information and technology services to support lenders and other creditors in the collections and recovery management process.
geographic information. we currently have operations in the following countries: argentina, australia, canada, chile, costa rica, dominican republic, ecuador, el salvador, honduras, india, mexico, new zealand, paraguay, peru, portugal, the republic of ireland, spain, the u.k., uruguay and the u.s. we also have investments in consumer and/or commercial credit information companies through joint ventures in cambodia, malaysia and singapore and have an investment in a consumer and commercial credit information company in brazil. we previously had a joint venture in russia that offered consumer credit services; however, during the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of this equity method investment. approximately 78% of our revenue was generated in the u.s. during both the twelve months ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.
seasonality. we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams. revenue generated by the online consumer information services component of our usis operating segment is typically the lowest during the first quarter, when consumer lending activity is at a seasonal low. revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w-2 and 1095-c services that occur in the first quarter each year. revenue generated from our financial wealth asset products and data management services in our financial marketing services business is generally higher in the fourth quarter each year due to the significant portion of our annual renewals and deliveries which occur then. mortgage related revenue is generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year due to the increase in consumer home purchasing during the summer in the u.s. any change in the u.s. mortgage market could have a corresponding impact on revenue and operating profit for our business, primarily within the workforce solutions and usis operating segments. although in recent years activity has been directly related to changes in interest rates, and this trend has been less observed.
key performance indicators. management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor operating and financial performance. these performance indicators include measurements of operating revenue, change in operating revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income, diluted earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures. key performance indicators for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 include the following:

revenue for 2022 increased by 4% compared to 2021. the increase was primarily due to growth in workforce solutions and international, partially offset by a decline in usis. the significant decline in u.s. mortgage originations negatively impacted the growth in workforce solutions and caused the decline in usis revenue. the effect of foreign exchange rates decreased revenue by $94.9 million, or 2%, in 2022 compared to 2021.
revenue for 2021 increased by 19% compared to 2020. the growth was driven by increases in our workforce solutions segment, across mortgage and non-mortgage related revenue, growth in our international segment and growth in non-mortgage related revenue in the usis segment. the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by $50.4 million, or 1%, in 2021 compared to 2020.
operating expenses twelve months ended                                                                                            change december 31,
cost of services. cost of services increased $196.3 million in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase is due to higher royalty costs, production costs, which include third party cloud usage fees, and people costs. the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates decreased cost of services by $50.5 million.
cost of services increased $243.5 million in 2021 compared to 2020. the increase is due to increased royalty costs, production costs, which include third party cloud usage fees, and people costs, partially offset by a decrease in incremental technology and data security costs related to our technology transformation. the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates increased cost of services by $27.5 million.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.3 million in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase in 2022 is primarily driven by companies acquired in 2022 and 2021, with the total increase in expenses partially offset by a decrease in incentive plan costs. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling, general and administrative expenses by $25.6 million.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.1 million in 2021 compared to 2020. the slight increase in 2021 is due to an increase in people costs, offset by a decrease in incremental technology and data security costs related to our ongoing technology transformation. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our selling, general and administrative expenses by $9.7 million.
depreciation and amortization. depreciation and amortization expense for 2022 and 2021 increased by $79.7 million and $89.4 million, respectively. these increases are due to higher amortization of purchased intangible assets related to recent acquisitions, as well as amortization of capitalized internal-use software and systems costs from technology transformation capital spending incurred previously. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates led to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of $11.6 million and an increase of $10.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

total company operating margin increased by 6.7 percentage points in 2021 versus 2020, due to higher operating income generated by the increased revenue and decreased incremental technology and data security costs, partially offset by the increased people costs and aforementioned increase in depreciation and amortization expense.
interest expense and other income (expense), net twelve months ended            change december 31,
interest expense increased in 2022, when compared to 2021, due to a higher weighted average outstanding amount of debt and higher interest costs attributable to debt agreements entered into during 2022.
the increase in other income (expense), net in 2022 is driven by changes in our fair value adjustments of our investments, gains on the sale of multiple equity investments and mark-to-market adjustments for our pension assets. we recorded a $13.3 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our brazil investment in 2022, compared to a $64.0 million loss in 2021. during 2022, we recorded a gain of $19.1 million as a result of the sale of multiple equity investments, including the sale of our equity method investment in russia during the third quarter of 2022. for 2022 and 2021, we recorded a $1.4 million gain and $20.2 million loss, respectively, on the mark-to-market adjustment of our pension plan assets.
the decrease in other income (expense), net in 2021 is driven by the changes in our fair value adjustments of our investments and mark-to-market adjustments for our pension assets. we recorded a $64.0 million loss on the fair value adjustment of our brazil investment in 2021, compared to a $149.5 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our brazil and india investments in 2020. for 2021 and 2020, we recorded a $20.2 million and $32.2 million loss, respectively, on the mark-to-market adjustment of our pension plan assets. these impacts were partially offset by positive impacts of foreign currency exchange in 2021.

financing activities twelve months ended december 31,                                                                  change net cash provided by (used in):                 2022                        2021                                2020                                       2022 vs. 2021                 2021 vs. 2020
borrowing and repayment activity.  net short-term repayments primarily represent repayments or borrowings of outstanding amounts under our cp program. we primarily borrow under our cp program as needed and as availability allows.
in september 2022, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.1% five-year senior notes due 2027 (the "2027 notes") in an underwritten public offering. interest on the 2027 notes accrues at a rate of 5.1% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year. the net proceeds of the sale of the 2027 notes were ultimately used to repay, in october 2022, our then-outstanding $500.0 million 3.30% senior notes due december 2022. the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under our commercial paper program. we must comply with various non-financial covenants, including certain limitations on mortgages, liens and sale-leaseback transactions, as well as mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. the 2027 notes are unsecured and rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
in august 2021, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.35% ten-year senior notes due 2031 (the "2031 notes") in an underwritten public offering. interest on the 2031 notes accrues at a rate of 2.35% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning on march 15, 2022. the net proceeds of the sale of the 2031 notes were used to repay the $300.0 million 3.6% senior notes due 2021 and $300.0 million floating rate notes due 2021. the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under our cp program and the funding of acquisitions, including the company's $1.825 billion acquisition of appriss insights. in addition, we also entered into a new $700.0 million delayed draw term loan facility during august 2021.
in april 2020, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.6% five-year senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 notes") and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.1% ten-year senior notes due 2030 (the "2030 notes") in an underwritten public offering. interest on the 2025 notes accrues at a rate of 2.6% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 of each year. interest on the 2030 notes accrues at a rate of 3.1% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 of each year. the net proceeds of the sale of the notes were used to repay borrowings under our receivables facility and revolver, while the remaining funds were used for general corporate purposes.
payments on long-term debt in 2022 reflect the october 2022 repayment of the $500.0 million senior notes due december 2022 with the proceeds from the $750.0 million 5.1% senior notes issued in september 2022 and commercial paper borrowings. payments on long-term debt in 2021 reflect payments on the 2.3% senior notes, 3.6% senior notes and floating rate notes that were due in 2021 using proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and the new term loan. payments on long-term debt in 2020 reflect payments on our receivable facility using proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes.
credit facility availability.  in august 2021, the company refinanced the existing unsecured revolving credit facility of $1.1 billion set to expire september 2023, and entered into a new $1.5 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the "revolver") and a new $700.0 million delayed draw term loan ("term loan"), collectively known as the "senior credit facilities," both which mature in august 2026. borrowings under the senior credit facilities may be used for working capital, for capital expenditures, to refinance existing debt, to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes. the revolver includes an option to request a maximum of three one-year extensions of the maturity date, any time after the first anniversary of the closing date of the revolver. we believe we are currently in compliance with all representations and warranties necessary as a condition for borrowing under the revolver, but we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all such conditions for borrowing in the future. availability of the revolver is reduced by the outstanding principal balance of our cp notes and by any letters of credit issued under the revolver.
in the third quarter of 2021, we increased the size of our cp program from $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion, consistent with the increase in our revolver. our $1.5 billion cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days. we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes. the cp program is supported by our revolver and the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our revolver and by any letters of credit issued under the facility.
as of december 31, 2022, there were $566.8 million of outstanding cp notes, $0.4 million of letters of credit outstanding, no outstanding borrowings under the revolver and $700.0 million outstanding under the term loan. availability under the revolver was $932.8 million at december 31, 2022.
in november 2020, we terminated our $225.0 million receivables funding facility (the "receivables facility").
debt covenants.  a downgrade in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program, revolver and term loan, and could limit or, in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue cp. our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on mortgages, liens, sale/leaseback transactions, mergers and sales of assets.
in august 2021, we entered into our new senior credit facilities as noted above in anticipation of the appriss insights acquisition. the senior credit facilities include a maximum leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded debt divided by consolidated ebitda for the preceding four quarters, of (i) 3.75 to 1.0 initially, (ii) 4.25 to 1.0 for the first fiscal quarter ending after the consummation of the appriss insights acquisition on october 1, 2021, through the third quarter of 2022, (iii) 4.0 to 1.0 for the fourth quarter of 2022 through the first quarter of 2023 and (iv) 3.75 to 1.0 for the second quarter of 2023 through the remaining term of the revolver. we may also elect to increase the maximum leverage ratio by 0.5 to 1.0 (subject to a maximum leverage ratio of 4.75 to 1.0) in connection with certain material acquisitions if we satisfy certain requirements. the senior credit facilities also permit cash in excess of $175 million to be netted against debt in the calculation of the leverage ratio, subject to certain restrictions.
none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations. as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants.
we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of the outstanding debt; however, our 3.95% senior notes due 2023, 2.6% senior notes due 2024, 2.6% senior notes due 2025, 3.25% senior notes due 2026, 5.1% senior notes due 2027, 3.1% senior notes due 2030, 2.35% senior notes due 2031 and 7.0% senior notes due 2037 (together, the "senior notes") contain change in control provisions. if we experience a change of control or publicly announces our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard & poor's ("s&p") and moody's investors service ("moody's") below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof, then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.
credit ratings. credit ratings reflect an independent agency's judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. the ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower's industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company's cash flows to changes in the economy. a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.
a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program, revolver and term loan, and could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue cp. if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt. in addition, the market's demand for, and thus our ability to readily issue, new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment. these ratings are subject to change as events and circumstances change.
for additional information about our debt, including the terms of our financing arrangements, basis for variable interest rates and debt covenants, see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
equity transactions twelve months ended december 31,                                                                change net cash (used in) provided by:                                                  2022                        2021                              2020                                       2022 vs. 2021                 2021 vs. 2020

sources and uses of cash related to equity during the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:
•we did not repurchase any shares from public market transactions in 2022. we repurchased 0.4 million of common shares from public market transactions in 2021. we did not repurchase any shares from public market transactions in 2020. as of december 31, 2022, under the existing board authorization, the company is approved for additional stock repurchases of $520.2 million.
•during the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid cash dividends to equifax shareholders of $191.1 million, $190.0 million and $189.5 million, respectively, at $1.56 per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020.
we anticipate continuing the payment of quarterly cash dividends. the actual amount of such dividends is subject to declaration by our board of directors and will depend upon future earnings, results of operations, capital requirements, our financial condition and other relevant factors. there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at current levels or at all.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company's material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. our plan is to use existing cash balances and funds generated by operating activities to fund our obligations and commitments. if our cash requirements exceed our existing cash balances and funds generated by operations, we will finance future cash requirements with existing borrowing capacity, as necessary. in the event that additional financing is needed, we would finance using the public and private corporate bond markets and/or syndicated loan markets, if available. the following sections provide details of material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of december 31, 2022.
debt as of december 31, 2022, we had outstanding variable and fixed rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $5.3 billion, with $400.4 million payable within the next twelve months, as detailed further in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. future interest payments associated with the outstanding variable and fixed rate notes totals $1,078.8 million, with $219.6 million payable within the next twelve months.
we also issue unsecured short-term promissory notes through our revolving credit facility and cp program, which is set to expire in august 2026. as of december 31, 2022, we had no amount outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility and $566.8 million outstanding under our cp program.
data processing, outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations we utilize several outsourcing partners for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions, cloud provider services and certain administrative functions. these agreements expire between 2023 and 2028. as of december 31, 2022 the estimated aggregate minimum contractual obligation remaining under these agreements is approximately $948.3 million, with $361.0 million payable within the next twelve months.
pension, post-retirement and deferred compensation obligations as detailed further in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, we have several pension, post-retirement benefit and deferred compensation plans. our u.s. retirement plan is frozen and is supported by plan assets to fund future payments. during the third quarter of 2022, we settled the liabilities under our canadian retirement income plan. we have three supplemental retirement plans for certain key employees which are unfunded. as of december 31, 2022, the total gross obligation for the pension and post retirement plans was $513.9 million, with $44.2 million of benefits expected to be paid within the next twelve months.
we maintain deferred compensation plans for certain management employees and the board of directors to defer the receipt of compensation until a later date based on the terms of the plan. as of december 31, 2022, the total obligation for the deferred compensation plans was $39.9 million, with $3.8 million expected to be paid within the next twelve months. these obligations exclude those under our deferred stock compensation plans.
payments to resolve certain legal proceedings and investigations the company has made and expects to make payments to resolve certain legal proceedings and investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, described more fully in "item 3. legal proceedings" in this form 10-k. through 2022, the company has made payments of $788.6 million for legal settlements related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. on january 11, 2022, the consumer settlement became effective, and on january 24, 2022, we deposited the $345.0 million remaining to be paid to the consumer restitution fund.
leases as detailed further in note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report, our lease arrangements principally involve office space. as of december 31, 2022, our total fixed lease payment obligations were $105.1 million, with $29.7 million payable within the next twelve months.
other planned uses of capital we will continue to invest in sales, marketing, new product development, security and our technology, as well as continue to make strategic acquisitions that align with our business strategy. additions to property and equipment will continue in order to support growth in our technology transformation and new product development, although we expect spending related to capital expenditures for the next twelve months to be down from current levels.
off-balance sheet transactions we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities.
pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds, we previously transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of $156.4 million as of december 31, 2021 to a local governmental authority in the u.s. to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development. as of december 31, 2022, the title to these assets had reverted back to us upon the retirement of the applicable bonds. these fixed assets are recognized in the company's consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company.
letters of credit and guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit, performance or surety bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business. the aggregate notional amount of all performance and surety bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31, 2022, and generally have a remaining maturity of one year or less. guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units. the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31, 2022.
benefit plans we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan, the u.s. retirement income plan ("usrip"), that covers approximately 6% of current u.s. salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30, 2007, the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was closed to new participation at december 31, 2008. this plan also covers retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status. we also sponsored a retirement plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution components that covered most salaried and hourly employees in canada, the canadian retirement income plan ("crip"); the defined benefit component was also closed to new hires on october 1, 2011.
during the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, we made no voluntary contributions to the usrip and made contributions of $15.5 million to the crip. during the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, we made no voluntary contributions to the usrip and made contributions of $2.8 million to the crip. at december 31, 2022, the usrip met or exceeded erisa's minimum funding requirements. in the future, we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions, depending on certain circumstances, including market conditions and liquidity needs. we believe additional funding contributions would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs, which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and our credit facilities. during the third quarter of 2022, we settled the liabilities under the crip.
for our non-u.s. tax-qualified retirement plans, we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations. for the non-qualified supplemental retirement plans, we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants, but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap.
for additional information about our benefit plans, see notes 1 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates inflation in the countries in which we operate may result in increases in the company's expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered. to the extent inflation results in rising u.s. interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the u.s. securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments, it may adversely affect the company's financial position and profitability. increases in u.s. interest rates may also negatively impact the u.s. mortgage market, which may adversely affect the company's revenue, financial position and profitability.
a portion of the company's business is conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar can therefore affect the value of non-u.s. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored. we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments, hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency.
recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap. this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements. the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made. in addition, while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time, different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, and statements of comprehensive income. we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results. for additional information about these policies, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report. although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.
revenue recognition in accordance with asc 606, "revenue from contracts with customers," we recognize revenue when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer and the customer obtains control of the good or service. in order to recognize revenue, we note that the two parties must have an agreement that creates enforceable rights, the performance obligations must be distinct and the transaction price can be determined. our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transactional basis, in which distinct services are delivered over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services delivered. to measure our performance over time, the output method is utilized to measure the value to the customer based on the transfer to date of the services promised, with no rights of return once consumed. in these cases, revenue on transactional contracts with a defined price but an undefined quantity is recognized utilizing the right to invoice expedient resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed. additionally, multi-year contracts with defined pricing but an undefined quantity that utilize tier pricing would be defined as a series of distinct performance obligations satisfied over time utilizing the same method of measurement, the output method, with no rights of return once consumed. this measurement method is applied on a monthly basis resulting in revenue being recognized when the service is provided and billed.
additionally, we recognize revenue from subscription-based contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period, generally one year. revenue from subscription-based contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided, using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are delivered. any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract's subscription period. revenue from subscription-based contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term. multi-year subscription contracts are analyzed to determine the full contract transaction price over the term of the contract and the subsequent price is ratably recognized over the full term of the contract.
if at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that collectability is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectability becomes probable or the receipt of payment from the customer. if there is uncertainty as to the customer's acceptance of the performance obligation, revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period.
certain costs incurred prior to the satisfaction of a performance obligation are deferred as contract costs and are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of transfer of the related goods and services. these costs generally consist of labor costs directly relating to the implementation and setup of the contract.
contract balances - the contract balances are generated when revenue recognized varies from billing in a given period. a contract asset is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes more revenue than what has been billed. as of december 31, 2022, the contract asset balance was $12.2 million. a contract liability is created when an entity transfers a good or service to a customer and recognizes less than what has been billed. deferred revenue is recognized when we have an obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer and have already received consideration from the customer. we generally expect to recognize our deferred revenue as revenue within twelve months of being recorded based on the terms of the contracts.
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually (as of september 30) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance or trends, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. we have six reporting units: workforce solutions, usis, asia pacific, europe, latin america and canada.
we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our workforce solutions, usis, latin america, europe and canada reporting units. in this qualitative assessment, we considered the following items for each of the reporting units: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance and other entity specific events. in addition, for each of these reporting units, the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units. based on these assessments, we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not. as a result of our conclusions, no further testing was required for these reporting units.
the goodwill balance at december 31, 2022, for our six reporting units was as follows:
workforce solutions                   $2,520.8
u.s. information solutions             2,004.8
valuation techniques we performed a quantitative assessment for our asia pacific reporting unit to determine whether impairment exists from the most recent valuation date due to the size of the cushion and overall uncertainty in the reporting unit due to the negative impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on the region. in determining the fair value of the reporting unit, we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit's business enterprise value.
under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and long-term revenue growth rates, operating margins for the reporting unit, discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital expenditures. the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization, for benchmark companies or guideline transactions. we believe the benchmark companies used for our asia pacific reporting unit serves as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks, participate in similar markets, provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly. the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our discussion of competition in item 1 of this form 10-k and have not significantly changed since the date of our last annual impairment test. competition for our asia pacific reporting unit generally includes global consumer credit reporting companies, such as experian, which offer a product suite similar to the reporting unit's credit reporting solutions.
the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit's fair value. we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units. this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70% of the value coming from the income approach. we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations. the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value. judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value.
we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of our last annual impairment test.
growth assumptions the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance, the details of which are described in our management's discussion & analysis of operating performance. additionally, we consider the impact that known economic, industry and market trends, including the impact of rising interest rates and inflation, will have on our future forecasts, as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives, client service and retention standards, and cost management programs. at the end of the forecast period, the long-term growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of our asia pacific reporting unit was between 3.0% and 4.0% based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit, as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve.
we projected revenue growth in 2023 for our asia pacific reporting unit in completing our 2022 impairment testing based on expected continued economic recovery from the negative impact the covid-19 pandemic had on these regions in previous years and planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by this reporting unit. the anticipated revenue growth in this reporting unit, however, is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses and capital expenditures for the reporting unit which reflects the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth and completion of our technology transformation initiatives.
discount rate assumptions we utilize a weighted average cost of capital, or wacc, in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows for the reporting unit. we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. to calculate the wacc, the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures. the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the risk-free interest rate, beta, equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit. the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company's tax rate. for the 2022 annual goodwill impairment evaluation, the discount rate used to develop the estimated fair value of the asia pacific reporting unit was between 9.5% and 11.0%.
estimated fair value and sensitivities the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions. impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. the estimated fair value for our asia pacific reporting unit exceeded its related carrying value as of september 30, 2022. as a result, no goodwill impairment was recorded.
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. for example, an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value. we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. due to the lower cushion when compared to other reporting units, asia pacific is more sensitive to changes in the assumptions noted above that could result in a fair value that is less than its carrying value. the excess of fair value over carrying value for the asia pacific reporting unit was greater than 5% and 10% as of september 30, 2022 and september 30, 2021, respectively.
given the relatively smaller excess of fair value over carrying value for the asia pacific reporting unit, we believe that it is at risk of a possible future goodwill impairment. the excess of fair value for the asia pacific reporting unit is lower in 2022 than in 2021 primarily due to higher observed risk free interest rates and the loss of income from our joint venture in russia which was formerly included in this reporting unit. the future impact of changes in economic conditions, including rising interest rates and inflation, remains uncertain. avoidance of a future impairment will be dependent on continued growth during current economic conditions and our ability to execute on initiatives to grow revenue and manage expenses prudently. we will continue to monitor the performance of this reporting unit to ensure no interim indications of possible impairment have occurred before our next annual goodwill impairment assessment in september 2023.
loss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business. we determine whether to disclose and/or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is estimable, probable, reasonably possible or remote.
in 2017, we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of personal information of consumers. as a result of the 2017 cybersecurity incident, we were subject to proceedings and investigations as described in "item 3. legal proceedings" in this form 10-k. we recorded estimated expenses, net of insurance recoveries, of $800.9 million in other current liabilities and selling, general, and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the twelve months ended december 31, 2019, exclusive of our legal and professional services expenses. the amount accrued represents our best estimate of the liability related to these matters. the company will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with asc 450-20-25. while it is reasonably possible that losses exceeding the amount accrued may be incurred, it is not possible at this time to estimate the additional possible loss in excess of the amount already accrued that might result from adverse judgments, settlements, penalties or other resolution of the proceedings and investigations described in "item 3. legal proceedings" in this form 10-k.
judgments and uncertainties - we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors. if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated amount. if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible, but not probable, we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency. our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies. however, if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates, we may be exposed to a loss that could be material.
income taxes we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid. we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies. to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount we estimate will be recoverable.
our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities. we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations. we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals.
judgments and uncertainties - we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets. these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income, mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions, and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense. settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash. at december 31, 2022, $42.7 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, of which it is reasonably possible that up to $3.9 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material.
purchase accounting for acquisitions we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805, business combinations. in general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs. any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets. transaction costs, as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies, are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income.
judgments and uncertainties - we consider accounting for business combinations critical because management's judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect our results of operations.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions - although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets.

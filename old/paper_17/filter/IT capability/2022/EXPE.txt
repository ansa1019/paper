definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-gaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-gaap measure. adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above, in the legal proceedings section, as well as the notes to the financial statements. the non-gaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. adjusted for (1) net income
(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net;
(4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans;
(5) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, if any, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree, if any; (6)
certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other; (8)
that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation.
the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. in addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-
based compensation and acquisition-related
table of contents impacts, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. to adjusted ebitda is as follows:

financial position, liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are typically cash flows generated from operations, cash available under our credit facility as well as our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, which were $4.1
billion and $4.3 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021. our revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of
as of december 31, 2022, the total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the united states was $770 million ($456 million in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and $314 million in majority-owned subsidiaries). the amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the unites states, and for which future distributions could be taxable, was $65 million as of december 31, 2022. the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the u.s. federal income tax consequences of these earnings was $17 million as of december 31, 2022.
• redemption of 2.5% senior notes. in march 2022, we early redeemed all of the €650 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.5% senior notes due in june 2022. the redemption price for the 2.5% senior notes equaled 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date.
• redemption of 3.6% and 4.5% senior notes. in may 2022, we early redeemed all of our $500 million 3.6% senior notes due 2023, and in june 2022, we early redeemed all of our $500 million 4.5% senior notes due 2024, which resulted in the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of $24 million primarily comprised of "make-whole"
premiums as well as the write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs.
• redemption of 2.95% senior notes. in september 2022, we settled the tender offer to purchase $500 million in aggregate principal of our 2.95% senior notes due 2031 for an aggregate cash repurchase price of approximately $418
million, which resulted in the recognition of a net gain on debt extinguishment of $73 million. the net gain included the write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs as well as related fees.
our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. as of december 31, 2022, moody's rating was baa3
with an outlook of "stable," s&p's rating was bbb- with an outlook of "stable" and fitch's rating was bbb- with an outlook of "stable." changes in our operating results, cash flows, financial position, capital structure, financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase, dividends, investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies.
table of contents should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow and/or limited access to capital markets and interest rates on our 6.25% senior notes, 4.625% senior notes as well as our 2.95% senior notes will increase, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt as detailed in note 7 - debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction. for most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant lodging business, we generally pay after the travelers' use and, in some cases, subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers. therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. typically, the seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings have affected the timing of our annual cash flows. generally, during the first half of the year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. during the second half of the year, this pattern typically reverses and cash flows are typically negative. during 2020, impacts of covid-19 disrupted our typical working capital trends. significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes, particularly in the first half of 2020, resulted in material operating losses and negative cash flow. during 2022, booking and travel trends have nearly normalized resulting in working capital benefits and positive cash flow in the current period akin to typical historical trends. however, it remains difficult to forecast the working capital trends for the upcoming quarters, given the uncertainty related to the full duration and total impact of covid-19.
prior to covid-19, we embarked on an ambitious cost reduction initiative to simplify the organization and increase efficiency. in response to covid-19, we took several additional actions to further reduce costs to help mitigate the financial impact from covid-19 and continue to improve our long-term cost structure. for 2023, we expect total capital expenditures for the full year to increase relative to our 2022 spending levels as we look to continue to improve our technology platforms, infrastructure, operational capabilities, and in the development of service offerings and expansion of our operations.

on cash and cash equivalents in 2022, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $308 million primarily due to a decrease in benefits from working capital changes driven mostly from a change in deferred merchant booking, which was largely offset by higher operating income after adjusting for impacts of depreciation and amortization.
in 2022, $351 million less cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net sales and maturities of investments of $145 million in 2022 compared to net purchases of investments of $178 million in 2021.
cash used in financing activities in 2022 primarily included payments of $2.2 billion related to the extinguishment of our 2.5% senior notes, 3.6% senior notes, 4.5% senior notes and the tender offer for a portion of our 2.95%
senior notes discussed above as well as $607 million of cash paid to acquire shares, including the repurchased shares under the authorizations discussed below and for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments. these uses of cash were partially offset by $131 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. cash used in financing activities in 2021 primarily included payments of approximately $2 billion related to the extinguishment of debt and $1.2 billion for the redemption of preferred stock as well as $165 million of cash paid for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments and $67 million in preferred stock dividends. these uses of cash were largely offset by approximately $2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and 2.95% senior notes issued in february and march 2021, respectively, as well as $503 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans.
our board of directors and the executive committee, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the board, have authorized share repurchases under authorized programs. these programs were temporarily halted in early 2020 with the onset of the covid-19 pandemic but resumed in the second half of 2022. shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as
(1) amount excludes transaction costs.
as of december 31, 2022, 18.1 million shares remain authorized for repurchase with no fixed termination date for the repurchases.
foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a decrease of our cash and restricted cash balances denominated in foreign currency in both 2022 and 2021 of $190 million and $177 million, respectively, reflecting a net depreciation in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar during each year.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments. our material cash requirements as of december 31, 2022 include the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising in the normal course of business:
• principal payments related to our debt that is included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments. the company had senior notes and convertible notes, as described in note 7 - debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, with varying maturities and an aggregate principal amount of
$6.3 billion, none of which is payable within 12 months. based on current stated fixed rates, future interest payments associated with the senior notes total approximately $1.1 billion, with approximately $231 million payable within 12 months;
• our operating leases had fixed lease payment obligations, including imputed interest, of $443 million, with $88
million payable within 12 months; and
• purchase obligations representing the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners. these minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods, and payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use. the company had purchase obligations of $466 million, with $292 million payable within 12 months.
in addition, we had $284 million of net unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31,
2022, for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment.
see note 15 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our purchase obligations as well as amounts outstanding as of december 31, 2022 related to letters of credit and guarantees. other than the items described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2022.
in our opinion, our liquidity position provides sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable cash needs.
there can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, including refinancings, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us.

part ii. item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices.
our exposure to market risk includes our long-term debt, our revolving credit facilities, derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, intercompany receivables, investments, merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies. we manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures. our objective is to mitigate potential income statement, cash flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
• $1 billion of convertible senior unsecured notes due february 2026 with a fixed rate of 0% (the "convertible notes");
the 6.25%, 5.0%, 4.625%, 3.8%, 3.25%, and 2.95% senior unsecured notes are collectively the "senior notes." if market interest rates decline, our required payments will exceed those based on market rates. additionally, the
6.25%, 4.625% and 2.95% senior unsecured notes are subject to interest rate adjustments should our credit ratings be adjusted downwards, which would result in increased interest expense in the future. the total estimated fair value of our senior notes and convertible notes was approximately $5.8 billion and $9.2 billion as of december 31,
2022 and december 31, 2021, respectively. the fair value was determined based on quoted market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our debt by approximately $115 million.
we maintain a revolving credit facility of $2.5 billion, which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings. because our interest rate is tied to a market rate, we will be susceptible to fluctuations in
table of contents interest rates if, consistent with our practice to date, we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. we had no revolving credit facilities borrowings outstanding as of both december 31, 2022 and 2021.
foreign exchange risk we conduct business in certain international markets, primarily in australia, canada, china, the united kingdom, and the european union. because we operate in international markets, we have exposure to different economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates. our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in u.s.
dollars. changes in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses, which we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations.
to the extent practicable, we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies. additionally, we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. these instruments are typically short-term and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other, net. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net forward assets of $15 million and $3 million, respectively, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. we may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. we make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities including in some cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds, customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies. in the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results, we could experience greater volatility as a result of our hedges.
in march 2022, we entered into two fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps ("the swaps") with an aggregate notional amount of €300 million. the swaps were designated as net investment hedges of euro assets with the objective to protect the u.s. dollar value of our net investments in the euro foreign operations due to movements in foreign currency. during the term of each contract, we receive interest payments in u.s. dollars at a fixed rate of 5% and make interest payments in euros at an average fixed rate of 3.38%. the maturity date of both swaps is february 2026, whereby, we will receive u.s. dollars from and pay euros to the contract counterparties.
the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps was a $21 million asset as of december 31, 2022 recorded in long-term investments and other assets.
future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the u.s. dollar, the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period, and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing, through balance sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts, such exposures. as an example, if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10% against the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability balances were to all strengthen 10% against the u.s. dollar, we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately $31 million based on our foreign currency forward positions (including the impact of forward positions economically hedging our merchant revenue exposures) and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of december 31, 2022. as the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently, even daily, as do foreign exchange rates, the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period.
during 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $40 million ($37 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue), net foreign exchange rate losses of approximately $48 million ($37 million loss excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue) and net foreign exchange rate gains of approximately $71 million ($2 million gain excluding the contracts economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue). as we increase our operations in international markets, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases. the economic impact to us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. these changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies.
equity investment risk we are exposed to equity price risk as it relates to changes in fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies, investments in which we've elected the fair value option, and minority investments without readily determinable fair values. we recorded net losses of $345 million, $29 million, and $142 million related to these investments for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively (see note 3 - fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information). the fair values of our investments in equity securities of publicly-
table of contents traded companies (combined with our investments in which we've elected the fair value option) and minority investments without readily determinable fair values, were $564 million and $330 million, respectively, at december
31, 2022, and $909 million and $330 million, respectively, at december 31, 2021. a hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair values at december 31, 2022 of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded companies and minority investments without readily determinable fair values would have resulted in a loss, before tax, of approximately
$89 million, being recognized within other, net in our consolidated statements of operations.

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
as required by rule 13a-15(b) under the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the "exchange act"), our management, including our chairman and senior executive, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rule 13a-15(e) under the exchange act). based upon that evaluation, our chairman and senior executive, chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
management's report on internal control over financial reporting.
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rule 13a-15(f) of the exchange act. internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management has concluded that, as of december 31, 2022, the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. management has reviewed its assessment with the audit committee. ernst & young, llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022, as stated in their report which is included below.
limitations on controls.
management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.

opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited expedia group, inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). in our opinion, expedia group, inc. (the company)
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated february
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of expedia group, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of expedia group, inc. (the company) as of december
31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at december 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2022, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2022, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework), and our report dated february 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
loyalty programs as discussed in note 2 of the financial statements, travelers enrolled in the expedia rewards and hotels.com rewards loyalty programs (collectively "loyalty programs") earn reward points with each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for free or discounted future bookings. member consideration is allocated between travel services and reward points earned in the loyalty programs. the company defers the relative standalone selling price of earned reward points, net description of the matter    of rewards not expected to be redeemed (known as "breakage"), as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. to estimate the relative standalone selling price for reward points, the company considers the stated redemption value per point dictated by the terms of the loyalty programs and then estimates the future breakage of reward points based on statistical modeling techniques using historical member activity. the deferred loyalty rewards balance, net of amounts paid to the travel suppler, is recognized as revenue when the travel service purchased with the loyalty reward is satisfied.
table of contents auditing the company's deferred loyalty rewards balance is especially complex and judgmental due to significant measurement uncertainty in determining the expected future breakage of reward points. management uses statistical modeling techniques to estimate future breakage based on historical member activity. the amount of member consideration allocated to the reward points earned is sensitive to the expected future breakage assumption. changes in loyalty program terms or the method or manner in which reward points can be redeemed by members can change member behavior which increases the measurement uncertainty as historical member activity may not be indicative of future behavior.
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's review of the statistical modeling techniques and resulting breakage estimates.
we also tested controls over the completeness and accuracy of member activity data used in the breakage estimate analyses. this included controls over the company's systems and the application controls involved in the process to track loyalty reward member activity.
how we addressed the matter in our audit    to test the deferred loyalty rewards balance, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, involving our actuarial specialists to assist us in assessing the methods used by management and to develop an independent actuarial estimate of a reasonable range of breakage rates. we then compared this reasonable range of breakage rates to the company's estimates.
additionally, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the member activity data used by our actuarial specialists in their breakage analyses.
deferred tax assets valuation allowance as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company records a valuation allowance based on the assessment of the realizability of the company's deferred tax assets. the company establishes a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. for the year ended december 31, 2022, the company description of the matter                   recorded deferred tax assets of $1,343 million and a related valuation allowance of $242 million.
auditing management's assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets is complex because management's projection of future taxable income includes forward-looking assumptions that are inherently judgmental because they may be affected by future market or other economic conditions.
we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's review of the realizability of deferred tax assets. this included controls over management's evaluation of the sources of future taxable income.
we tested the assumptions used by the company to develop the anticipated future earnings used in the company's analysis in determining the valuation allowance. we tested the completeness and how we addressed the matter in our audit    accuracy of the underlying data used in the company's projections.
for example, we evaluated the appropriateness of the assumptions underlying the future projected financial information, as well as management's consideration of current operating, industry and economic trends. we also compared the projections of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the company. in addition, we evaluated the application of tax law in the projections of future taxable income.

notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 - organization and basis of presentation description of business expedia group, inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products and services to leisure and corporate travelers in the united states and abroad as well as various media and advertising offerings to travel and non-travel advertisers. these travel products and services are offered through a diversified portfolio of brands including:
brand expedia®, hotels.com®, expedia® partner solutions, vrbo®, trivago®, orbitz®, travelocity®, hotwire®, wotif®, ebookers®, cheaptickets®, expedia grouptm media solutions, carrentals.comtm and expedia cruisestm. in addition, many of these brands have related international points of sale. we refer to expedia group, inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as "expedia group," the "company," "us," "we" and "our" in these consolidated financial statements.
the covid-19 pandemic, and measures to contain the virus, had an unprecedented impact on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business, financial results and financial condition. with the evolution of milder covid-19 variants, availability of multiple vaccine booster doses and increasing familiarity with the virus, many covid-19 related travel restrictions have been lifted, and countries around the world reopened their borders for foreign travel. overall, the full duration and total impact of covid-19 remains uncertain and it is difficult to predict how the recovery will unfold for the travel industry and, in particular, our business, going forward.
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include expedia group, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities we control, or in which we have a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary of expected cash profits or losses. we record our investments in entities that we do not control, but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, using the equity method or at fair value. we have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts.
we believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements are reasonable. however, these consolidated financial statements do not present our future financial position, the results of our future operations and cash flows.
seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. for example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. since revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. historically, vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. as a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter.
significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes from covid-19 disrupted our typical seasonal pattern for bookings, revenue, profit and cash flows from 2020 through early 2022, but have generally returned to historic seasonality.
note 2 - significant accounting policies consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of expedia group, inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities for which we control a majority of the entity's outstanding common stock. we record non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements to recognize the minority ownership interest in our consolidated subsidiaries. non-controlling interest in the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners in our consolidated entities. trivago is a separately listed company on the nasdaq global select market and, therefore, is subject to its own reporting and filing requirements, which could result in possible differences that are not expected to be material to expedia group, inc.
we have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts in our consolidated financial statements.
table of contents accounting estimates we use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"). our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income or loss during any period. our actual financial results could differ significantly from these estimates. the significant estimates underlying our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition; recoverability of current and long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; income and transactional taxes, such as potential settlements related to occupancy and excise taxes; loss contingencies; deferred loyalty rewards; stock-based compensation; accounting for derivative instruments and provisions for credit losses, customer refunds and chargebacks.
reclassifications we have reclassified prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of our promised services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
for our primary transaction-based revenue sources, discussed below, we have determined net presentation (that is, the amount billed to a traveler less the amount paid to a supplier) is appropriate for the majority of our revenue transactions as the supplier is primarily responsible for providing the underlying travel services and we do not control the service provided by the supplier to the traveler. we exclude all taxes assessed by a government authority, if any, from the measurement of transaction prices that are imposed on our travel related services or collected by the company from customers (which are therefore excluded from revenue).
we offer traditional travel services on a stand-alone and package basis generally either through the merchant or the agency business model.
under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms, alternative accommodations, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings.
under the agency model, we pass reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel supplier and the travel supplier serves as the merchant of record for such bookings. we receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel supplier and/or traveler. for certain agency airline, hotel and car transactions, we also receive fees through global distribution systems ("gds") that provide the computer systems through which the travel supplier inventory is made available and through which reservations are booked.
under the advertising model, we offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on trivago and our transaction-based websites.
in addition, vrbo also provides subscription-based listing and other ancillary services to property owners and managers.
the nature of our travel booking service performance obligations vary based on the travel service with differences primarily related to the degree to which we provide post booking services to the traveler and the timing when rights and obligations are triggered in our underlying supplier agreements. we consider both the traveler and travel supplier as our customers.
refer to note 18 - segment information for revenue by business model and service type.
lodging. our lodging revenue is comprised of revenue recognized under the merchant, agency and vrbo subscription-
merchant hotel. we provide travelers access to book hotel room reservations through our contracts with lodging suppliers, which provide us with rates and availability information for rooms but for which we have no control over the rooms and do not bear inventory risk. our travelers pay us for merchant hotel transactions prior to departing on their trip, generally when they book the reservation. we record the payment in deferred merchant bookings until the stayed night occurs, at which point we recognize the revenue, net of amounts paid to suppliers, as this is when our performance obligation is satisfied. payments to suppliers are generally due within 30 days of check-in or stay. in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience.
cancellation fees are collected and remitted to the supplier, if applicable.
table of contents agency hotel. we generally record agency revenue from the hotel when the stayed night occurs as we provide post booking services to the traveler and, thus consider the stay as when our performance obligation is satisfied. we record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience.
merchant and agency vrbo alternative accommodations. vrbo's lodging revenue is generally earned on a pay-per-
booking basis, which can be either merchant or agency bookings depending on the nature of the payment processor.
pay-per-booking arrangements are commission-based where rental property owners and managers bear the inventory risk, have latitude in setting the price and compensate vrbo for facilitating bookings with travelers. under pay-
per-booking arrangements, each booking is a separate contract as listings are typically cancelable at any time and the related revenue, net of amounts paid to property owners, is recognized at check in, which is the point in time when our service to the traveler is complete. vrbo also charges a traveler service fee at the time of booking. the service fee charged to travelers provides compensation for vrbo's services, including but not limited to the use of vrbo's website and a "book with confidence guarantee" providing travelers with comprehensive payment protection and
24/7 traveler support. the performance obligation is to facilitate the booking of a property and assist travelers up to their check in process and, as such, the traveler service fee revenue is recognized at check-in.
subscription basis. in pay-per-subscription contracts, property owners or managers purchase in advance online advertising services related to the listing of their properties for rent over a fixed term (typically one year). as the performance obligation is the listing service and is provided to the property owner or manager over the life of the listing period, the pay-per-subscription revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the listing period.
merchant and agency air. we record revenue on air transactions when the traveler books the transaction, as we do not typically provide significant post booking services to the traveler and payments due to and from air carriers are typically due at the time of ticketing. we record a reserve for chargebacks and cancellations at the time of the transaction based on historical experience. in certain transactions, the gds collects commissions from our suppliers and passes these commissions to us, net of their fees. therefore, we view payments through the gds as commissions from suppliers and record these commissions in net revenue. fees paid to the gds as compensation for their role in processing transactions are recorded as cost of revenue.
advertising and media . we record revenue from click-through fees charged to our travel partners for leads sent to the travel partners' websites. we record revenue from click-through fees after the traveler makes the click-through to the related travel partners' websites. we record revenue for advertising placements ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of advertising impressions, depending on the terms of the contract. payments from advertisers are generally due within 30 days of invoicing.
other. other primarily includes transaction revenue for booking services related to products such as car, cruise and destination services under the agency business model. we generally record the related revenue when the travel occurs, as in most cases we provide post booking services and this is when our performance obligation is complete.
additionally, no rights or obligations are triggered in our supplier agreements until the travel occurs. we record an allowance for cancellations on this revenue based on historical experience. revenue from other ancillary alternative accommodation services or products are recorded either upon delivery or when we provide the service. in addition, other also includes travel insurance products primarily under the merchant model, for which revenue is recorded at the time the transaction is booked.
packages. packages assembled by travelers through the packaging functionality on our websites generally include a merchant hotel component and some combination of an air, car or destination services component. the individual package components are accounted for as separate performance obligations and recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies stated above.
prepaid merchant bookings. we classify payments made to suppliers in advance of vrbo performance obligations as prepaid merchant bookings included within prepaid and other current assets.prepaid merchant bookings was $
deferred merchant bookings. we classify cash payments received in advance of our performance obligations as deferred merchant bookings.at december 31, 2021, $ 4.9billion of advance cash payments was reported within deferred merchant bookings, $ 4.0billion of which was recognized resulting in $ 693million of revenue during the year ended december 31, 2022 with the remainder primarily consisting of cancellations during the year. at december 31, 2022, the related balance was $ 6.2billion.
travelers enrolled in our internally administered traveler loyalty rewards programs earn points for each eligible booking made which can be redeemed for free or discounted future bookings. hotels.com rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions.
expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on various brand expedia websites. orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks, the currency of orbitz rewards, on flights, hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty f- 12
table of contents rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques. revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points, that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. the majority of rewards expected to be redeemed are recognized within oneto two yearsof being earned.at december 31, 2021, $
798million of deferred loyalty rewards was reported within deferred merchant bookings, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended december 31, 2022. at december 31, 2022, the related balance was $ 961million.
practical expedients and exemptions. we have used the portfolio approach to account for our loyalty points as the rewards programs share similar characteristics within each program in relation to the value provided to the traveler and their breakage patterns. using this portfolio approach is not expected to differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts. however, we will continue to assess and refine, if necessary, how a portfolio within each rewards program is defined.
we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.
cash, restricted cash, and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial instruments, including money market funds and term deposit investments, with maturities of three months or less when purchased. restricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents that is restricted through legal contracts, regulations or our intention to use the cash for a specific purpose. our restricted cash primarily relates to certain traveler deposits and to a lesser extent collateral for office leases. the following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in our consolidated balance sheets to the total amount presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows:
the consolidated statements of cash flows short-term and long-term investments we determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. investments, other than minority equity investments, classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("oci"). realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale investments, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. investments with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments. all other investments are classified within long-term investments and other assets.
minority equity investments with either readily determinable fair values, or for which we have elected to apply the fair value option, are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded through net income or loss. minority investments without readily determinable fair values, for which we have not elected to measure at fair value, are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with observable price changes reflected through net income or loss. we perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value.
changes in value of minority equity investments are recorded in other income (expense), net.
accounts receivable accounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are recorded net of an allowance for expected uncollectible amounts. we consider accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms as past due. the risk characteristics we generally review when analyzing our accounts receivable pools primarily include the type of receivable (for example, credit f- 13
table of contents card vs hotel collect), collection terms and historical or expected credit loss patterns. for each pool, we make estimates of expected credit losses for our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, previous loss history continually updated for new collections data, the credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. the provision for estimated credit losses is recorded as cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. we also capitalize certain costs incurred related to the development of internal use software. we capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal use software. we expense costs incurred related to the planning and post-implementation phases of development as incurred.
we compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is threeto five yearsfor computer equipment, capitalized software development and furniture and other equipment,
15years for land improvements, and 40years for buildings, which includes our corporate headquarters. land is not depreciated. we amortize leasehold improvement using the straight-line method, over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease.
we establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to return certain of our leased facilities to their original condition under the authoritative accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations. such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated restoration costs.
leases we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. operating leases are primarily for office space and data centers and are included in operating lease right-of-use ("rou") assets, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. rou assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. operating lease rou assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
for operating leases with a term of one year or less, we have elected to not recognize a lease liability or rou asset on our consolidated balance sheet. instead, we recognize the lease payments as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. short-term lease costs are immaterial to our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.
we have office space and data center lease agreements with insignificant non-lease components and have elected the practical expedient to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
business combinations we assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition.
any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and trade names, and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. any changes to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill is assigned to reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. we assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, neither of which is amortized, for impairment annually as of october 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the f- 14
table of contents reporting unit to the carrying value. an impairment charge is recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired.
we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units, except for trivago, which is a separately listed company on the nasdaq global select market, on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary, which is based on market valuation. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. the fair value of the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago's stock price, a level 1 input, adjusted for an estimated control premium.
we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.
in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company's total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.
in our evaluation of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, we typically first perform a quantitative assessment and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value, if necessary. we base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. as with goodwill, periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not impaired.
recoverability of intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of oneto ten years. we review the carrying value of long-
lived assets or asset groups, including property and equipment, to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
assets held for sale, to the extent we have any, are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.
income taxes we record income taxes under the liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense.
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us f- 15
table of contents for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.
we account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria. the first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority, including resolution of any appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. if the tax position meets the more likely than not criteria, the portion of the tax benefit greater than
50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements.
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax expense line in our consolidated statement of operations. accrued interest and penalties are included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
in relation to tax effects for accumulated oci, our policy is to release the tax effects of amounts reclassified from accumulated oci to pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations. any remaining tax effect in accumulated oci is released following a portfolio approach.
we account for the global intangible low-tax income earned by our foreign subsidiaries included in gross u.s.
derivative instruments derivative instruments are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. the fair values of the derivative financial instruments generally represent the estimated amounts we would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the contracts as of the reporting date.
at december 31, 2022 and 2021, our derivative instruments primarily consisted of foreign currency forward contracts. we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-
denominated operating liabilities. our goal in managing our foreign exchange risk is to reduce, to the extent practicable, our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. our foreign currency forward contracts are typically short-term and, as they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we classify the changes in their fair value in other, net. we do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
until their redemption in march 2022, the aggregate principal value of our € 650million of registered senior unsecured notes that bore interest at 2.5% (the " 2.5% notes") was designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro-functional currency subsidiaries. the notes were measured at euro to u.s. dollar exchange rates at each balance sheet date and transaction gains or losses due to changes in rates were recorded in accumulated oci within the foreign currency translation adjustment. the euro denominated net assets of these subsidiaries were translated into u.s. dollars at each balance sheet date, with effects of foreign currency changes also reported in accumulated oci. in march 2022, we redeemed the 2.5% notes and terminated the related hedging relationship. the currency translation adjustment amounts associated with the net investment hedge of the 2.5% notes will remain in accumulated oci until realized upon a full or partial sale or liquidation of applicable euro-functional currency subsidiaries.
in march 2022, we entered into twofixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps (the "swaps") with an aggregate notional amount of € 300million. during the term of each contract, we receive interest payments in u.s. dollars at a fixed rate of 5% and make interest payments in euros at an average fixed rate of 3.38% based on a notional amount and fixed interest rates determined at contract inception. the swaps were designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain euro functional currency subsidiaries. hedge effectiveness is assessed each quarter based on the net investment in the foreign subsidiaries designated as the hedged item and the changes in the fair value of the designated interest rate swaps based on spot rates. for hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, changes in fair value are recorded as accumulated oci within the foreign currency translation adjustment. amounts excluded from hedge effectiveness at inception are recognized as interest accrues within interest expense. the maturity date of both swaps is february 2026, whereby, we will receive u.s. dollars from and pay euros to the contract counterparties.
foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses certain of our operations outside of the united states use the related local currency as their functional currency.
we translate revenue and expense at average rates of exchange during the period. we translate assets and liabilities at the rates of f- 16
table of contents exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and include foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of accumulated oci. due to the nature of our operations and our corporate structure, we also have subsidiaries that have significant transactions in foreign currencies other than their functional currency. we record transaction gains and losses in our consolidated statements of operations related to the recurring remeasurement and settlement of such transactions.
to the extent practicable, we attempt to minimize this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities of similarly denominated foreign currencies. additionally, as discussed above, we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities.
debt issuance costs we defer costs we incur to issue debt, which are presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, and amortize these costs to interest expense over the term of the debt or in circumstances where the debt can be redeemed at the option of the holders, over the term of the redemption option.
marketing promotions we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services.
current discount offers. these promotions include dollar or percent off discounts to be applied against current purchases. we record the discounts as reduction in revenue at the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.
inducement offers. these promotions include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase. we treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. we allocate the discount amount at the time of the offer between the current performance obligation and the potential future performance obligations based on our expected relative value of the transactions. we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers.
concession offers. these promotions include discounts to be applied against a future purchase to maintain customer satisfaction. upon issuance, we record these concession offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. we estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for concession offers.
advertising expense we incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs, including television and radio advertising, and online advertising expense to promote our brands. we expense the production costs associated with advertisements in the period in which the advertisement first takes place. we expense the costs of communicating the advertisement (e.g., television airtime) as incurred each time the advertisement is shown.for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021
stock-based compensation we measure and amortize the fair value of restricted stock units ("rsus") and stock options as follows:
restricted stock units. rsus are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests, typically over a four-yearperiod, but may accelerate in certain circumstances. we measure the value of rsus at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock at the date of grant. we amortize the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line basis. in addition, we have a limited number of performance stock units ("psus"), for which we calculate the fair value using a monte carlo valuation model and amortized the fair value, net of actual forfeitures, as stock-based compensation over the vesting term, generally a twoor three yearperiod, on an accelerated basis. the number of shares that ultimately vest depends on achieving certain performance metrics or performance goals, as applicable, by the end of the performance period, assuming there is no accelerated vesting for, among other things, a termination of employment under certain circumstances. we record rsus that may be settled by the holder in cash, rather than shares, as a liability and we remeasure these instruments at fair value at the end of each reporting period. upon settlement of these awards, our total compensation expense recorded over the vesting period of the awards will equal the settlement amount, which is based on our stock price on the settlement date.
stock options. our employee stock options consist of service based awards. we measure the value of stock options issued or modified, including unvested options assumed in acquisitions, on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using appropriate valuation techniques, including the black-
scholes. we amortize the fair value, net f- 17
table of contents of actual forfeitures, over the remaining explicit vesting term in the case of service-based awards and the longer of the derived service period or the explicit service period for awards with market conditions on a straight-line basis. in addition, we classify certain employee option awards as liabilities when we deem it not probable that the employees holding the awards will bear the risk and rewards of stock ownership for a reasonable period of time.
such options are revalued at the end of each reporting period and upon settlement our total compensation expense recorded from grant date to settlement date will equal the settlement amount. the majority of our stock options vest over threeto four years.
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value.
earnings per share we compute basic earnings per share by taking net income or loss attributable to expedia group, inc. available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common and class b common shares outstanding during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow. diluted earnings per share include the potential dilution that could occur from stock-based awards and other stock-based commitments (which includes our convertible notes) using the treasury stock or the if converted method, as applicable. for additional information on how we compute earnings per share, see note 12 - earnings per share.
fair value recognition, measurement and disclosure the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents reported on our consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value as we maintain them with various high-quality financial institutions. the accounts receivable are short-term in nature and are generally settled shortly after the sale.
we disclose the fair value of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy using the following three categories:
level 1 - valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
level 2 - valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
level 3 - valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the company's own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. these valuations require significant judgment.
certain risks and concentrations our business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers, primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and payment related fraud. we also rely on global distribution system partners and third-party service providers for certain fulfillment services .
financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. we maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances with financial institutions that are in excess of federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits. our cash and cash equivalents are primarily composed of term deposits as well as bank (both interest and non-interest bearing) account balances denominated in u.s. dollars, euros, british pound, canadian dollar, australian dollar, brazilian real, swiss franc and indian rupee.
contingent liabilities we have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding, as discussed further in note 15 - commitments and contingencies. periodically, we review the status of all significant outstanding matters to assess the potential financial exposure. when (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and
(ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated loss in our consolidated statements of operations. we provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both of these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. we base accruals made on the best information available at the time which can be highly subjective. the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
table of contents occupancy and other taxes some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax, and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. generally, hotels collect taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. when a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. in most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain. some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to collect and remit such taxes. a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against certain of our companies for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on our services. we are an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting a vacation property and we believe is similarly not liable for such taxes. we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time.
we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes when determined to be probable and estimable. see note 15 - commitments and contingencies for further discussion.
recently adopted accounting policies in june 2022, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued new guidance related to fair value measurement of equity securities, which clarifies the fair value measurement of an equity security that is subject to a contractual sale restriction and requires specific disclosures related to such an equity security. the new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. we elected to early adopt the new guidance in the second quarter of 2022 on a prospective basis. one of our minority equity investments is accounted for in accordance with this new guidance see note 3 - fair value measurements for additional information.
recent accounting policies not yet adopted in october 2021, the fasb issued new guidance relate to recognizing and measuring contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. the new guidance will require acquiring entities to apply topic 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination as compared to current gaap where an acquirer generally recognizes such items at fair value on the acquisition date. the new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. we do not expect it will have a material impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.

we classify our cash equivalents and investments within level 1 and level 2 as we value our cash equivalents and investments using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. valuation of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on foreign currency exchange rates in active markets, a level 2 input. valuation of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is based on foreign currency exchange rates and the current interest rate curve, level 2 inputs.
we hold term deposit investments with financial institutions. term deposits with original maturities of less than three months are classified as cash equivalents, those with remaining maturities of less than one year are classified within short-term investments and those with remaining maturities of greater than one year are classified within long-term investments and other assets.
as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of term deposits, money market funds and mutual funds with maturities of three months or less and bank account balances.
we use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures, foreign denominated liabilities related to certain of our loyalty programs and our other foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. as of december 31, 2022, we were party to outstanding forward contracts hedging our liability exposures with a total net notional value of $ 2.8billion. as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net forward assets of $ 15million ($ 29million gross forward asset) and $ 3million ($ 12million gross forward asset)
recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets. we recorded $( 66) million, $ 1million and $ 74million in net gains (losses) from foreign currency forward contracts in 2022, 2021 and 2020.
on march 2, 2022, we entered into twofixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of € 300million, and maturity dates of february 2026. the swaps were designated as net investment hedges of euro assets with the objective to protect the u.s. dollar value of our net investments in the euro foreign operations due to movements in foreign currency. the fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps was a $
21million asset as of december 31, 2022 recorded in long-term investments and other assets, and the gain recognized in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2022 was $ 5million.
our equity investments include our marketable equity investment in despegar, a publicly traded company, which is included in long-term investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recognized losses of approximately $ 45million, $ 29million and $ 6million, respectively, within other, net in our consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value changes of this equity investment.
in connection with our disposition of egencia (our former corporate travel arm) in november 2021 as discussed in note 16 - divestitures, we became an indirect holder of approximately 19% interest in gbt jerseyco ltd. ("gbt"), doing business as american express global business travel, with an initial fair value of $ 815million. as we elected the fair value option for our investment, during the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a downward adjustment of approximately $ 2million based on an updated valuation. in may 2022, gbt completed a despac business combination with apollo strategic growth capital. this combination resulted in a newly publicly traded company, global business travel group, inc ("gbtg"), which together with gbt's pre-combination shareholders owned all of gbt. post combination and as of december 31, 2022, we had an approximately 16% ownership interest in gbt and a commensurate voting interest in gbtg. our shares in gbt are exchangeable on a 1:1 basis for gbtg shares, and as such, we valued our investment based on the gbtg's share price as of f- 20
table of contents the last trading day in 2022, which resulted in a loss of $ 300million within other, net in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022.
the following table reconciles, in millions, the beginning and ending balances of our level 3 assets. with the may
2022 business combination of gbtg, we reclassified our equity investment from a level 3 asset to a level 2 asset.
assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis our non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity method investments for which we have not elected the fair value option, are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized or the underlying investment is sold. such fair value measurements are based predominately on level 3 inputs. we measure our minority investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment, adjusted by observable price changes with changes recorded within other, net on our consolidated statements of operations.
goodwill . during 2021, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $ 14million in our b2b segment resulting from valuing a component of our egencia reporting unit that remained after the sale on november 1, 2021.
during 2020, due to the severe and persistent negative effect covid-19 had on global economies, the travel industry and our business, as well as the uncertainty and high variability in anticipated versus actual rates of recovery, in addition to our annual assessment on october 1, 2020, we deemed it necessary to perform various interim assessments of goodwill. as a result of assessments during 2020, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $
799million, of which $ 559million related to our retail segment, primarily our vrbo reporting unit, and $
our assessments compared the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying value. the fair value estimates for all reporting units, except trivago, were based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market value approach, level 3 inputs. the significant estimates used in the discounted cash flows model included our weighted average cost of capital, projected cash flows and the long-term rate of growth. our assumptions were based on the actual historical performance of the reporting unit and took into account operating result trends, the anticipated duration of covid-19 impacts and rates of recovery, and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our equity and debt as of the assessment dates. our significant estimates in the market approach model included identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and earnings multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. the fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago's stock price, a level 1 input, adjusted for an estimated control premium. the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over our estimate of the fair value was recorded as goodwill impairment charges during 2020. as of december 31, 2020, the applicable reporting units within our retail segment had $ 2.3billion goodwill remaining after the impairments incurred in 2020 and our trivago segment had $ 337million goodwill remaining.
as noted above, trivago is subject to its own reporting and filing requirements and, therefore, assesses goodwill at a lower level, which could result in possible differences in the ultimate amount or timing of impairments recognized. additionally, as the stock of our trivago segment is publicly traded, it is difficult to predict market dynamics and the extent or duration of any stock price declines.
intangible and long-term assets. during 2022, we recognized intangible impairment charges of $ 81million related to an indefinite-lived trade name within our trivago segment that primarily resulted from changes in the weighted average cost of capital. the indefinite-lived trade name asset, classified as level 3 measurements, was valued using the relief-from-royalty method, which includes unobservable inputs, including projected revenues, royalty rates and weighted average cost of capital.
during 2021, we recognized long-term asset impairment charges of $ 6million in our b2b segment resulting from the write-off of capitalized software of a component of our egencia reporting unit that remained after the sale on november 1, 2021.
during 2020, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $ 175million within our retail segment, of which
$ 119million related to indefinite-lived trade namesthat resulted from changes in estimated future revenues of the related brands as well as $ 35million related to definite-lived intangible assetsand $ 21million related to other long-lived assets. the indefinite-lived intangible assets, classified as level 3 measurements, were valued using the relief-from-royalty method, which includes unobservable inputs, including projected revenues and royalty rates, which ranged from 2% to 8% with a weighted average royalty rate of 7%. for definite-lived intangible assets, classified as level 3 measurements, we compared the estimated f- 21
table of contents future, net undiscounted cash flows, which included key inputs such as rates of growth and profitability of our business as well as incremental net working capital, to the long-lived asset's carrying amount. during 2020, we met the criteria to recognize certain smaller businesses within our retail segment as held-for-sale. as such, we remeasured the disposal groups at fair value, less costs to sell, which is considered a level 3 measurement and was based on each transaction's estimated consideration as of the date of close.
minority investments without readily determinable fair values. as of both december 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying values of our minority investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $ 330million. during 2022 and
2021, we had nomaterial gains or losses recognized related to these minority investments. during 2020, we recorded
$ 134million of losses related to a minority investment, which had recent observable and orderly transactions for similar investments, using an option pricing model that utilizes judgmental inputs such as discounts for lack of marketability and estimated exit event timing. as of december 31, 2022, total cumulative adjustments made to the initial cost basis of these investments included $ 2million in unrealized upward adjustments and $ 105million in unrealized downward adjustments (including impairments).

as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, our recorded capitalized software development costs, net of accumulated amortization, which have been placed in service were $ 960million and $ 895million. for the years ended december
31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded amortization of capitalized software development costs of $ 597million, $
as of december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we had $ 26million, $ 4million and $ 9million, respectively, included in accounts payable for the acquisition of property and equipment, which is considered a non-cash investing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

impairment assessments. we perform our annual assessment of possible impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of october 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
during 2022, we recognized an intangible impairment charge of $ 81million related to an indefinite-lived trade name within our trivago segment. during 2021, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $ 14million. during 2020, due to the severe and persistent negative effect covid-19 had on global economies, the travel industry and our business, as well as the uncertainty and high variability in anticipated versus actual rates of recovery, in addition to our annual assessment, we deemed it necessary to perform various interim assessments of goodwill and intangible assets. as a result of these assessments, we recognized goodwill impairment charges of $ 799million, of which $ 559million related to our retail segment, primarily our vrbo reporting unit, and $ 240million related to our trivago segment. we also incurred impairment charges of $ 175million related to intangible assets with both indefinite-lives and definite lives, primarily within our retail segment.

as of december 31, 2022, we had u.s. federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards ("nols") of approximately $ 1.1billion, $ 465million and $ 268million. u.s. federal nols of $ 1.1billion may be carried forward indefinitely. state nols of $ 103million may be carried forward indefinitely, and state nols of $ 362million expire at various times starting from 2025. foreign nols of $ 188million may be carried forward indefinitely, and foreign nols of $ 80million expire at various times starting from 2023.
as of december 31, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $ 242million related to certain tax attribute carryforwards for which it is more likely than not the tax benefits will not be realized. the valuation allowance increased by $ 71million from the amount recorded as of december 31, 2021 primarily due to the unrealized capital losses on minority investments, offset by use of net operating losses. the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable may be adjusted if capital gains are realized or if, in certain jurisdictions, objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative gaap losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
the majority of our foreign undistributed earnings have already been subject to u.s. federal income tax. as of december 31, 2022, we have undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $ 65million that are considered indefinitely reinvested and we estimate that the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the u.s. federal, state and foreign income tax consequences of these earnings was $ 17million.

the company is routinely audited by u.s. federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities. these audits include f- 32
table of contents questioning the timing and amount of income and deductions, and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. the internal revenue service ("irs") is currently examining expedia group's u.s.
consolidated federal income tax returns for the periods ended december 31, 2011 through december 31, 2020. the company has consented to an extension of the statute of limitations, until june 30, 2024 related to the 2011
2022, for the expedia group, inc. and subsidiaries group, statute of limitations for tax years 2011 through 2021
remain open to examination in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and most state jurisdictions. for the homeaway and orbitz groups, the tax years 2001 through 2015 remain subject to examination in the u.s. federal and most state jurisdictions due to nol carryforwards.
during the fourth quarter of 2019, the irs issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to 2013 tax years. the adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by $
696million, which would result in u.s. federal tax of approximately $ 244million, subject to interest. we do not agree with the position of the irs. we have formally filed a protest for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and the case has been transferred to appeals. during the fourth quarter of 2022, the irs issued similar proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2014 to 2016 tax years. the adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by $ 1.413billion, which would result in federal tax of approximately $
494million, subject to interest. the proposed adjustments provided by the irs exclude any offsetting adjustments that may reduce the amount of federal tax. we do not agree with the position of the irs and intend to formally protest. we believe it is reasonably possible that audit of the 2011 and 2013 tax years will conclude within the next 12 months.

note 12 - earnings per share basic earnings per share basic earnings per share was calculated for the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 using the weighted average number of common and class b common shares outstanding during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow.
diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31, 2022, we computed diluted earnings per share using (i) the number of shares of common stock and class b common stock used in the basic earnings per share calculation as indicated above, (ii) if dilutive, the incremental common stock that we would issue upon the assumed exercise or vesting of stock-based awards and common stock warrants using the treasury stock method, (iii) if dilutive, our convertible notes using the if-converted method, and (iv) other stock-based commitments. in periods when we recognize a net loss, such as the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, we f- 34

for the year ended december 31, 2022, approximately 9million of outstanding stock-based awards have been excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share attributable to common stockholders because their effect would have been antidilutive. for the year ended december 31, 2021, approximately 11million of outstanding stock-based awards and approximately four millionshares related to the potential share settlement impact related to our convertible notes were excluded. for the year ended december 31, 2020, approximately 22million of outstanding stock-based awards and common stock warrants were excluded.
the earnings per share amounts are the same for common stock and class b common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.
note 13 - restructuring and related reorganization charges in 2020, we committed to restructuring actions intended to simplify our businesses and improve operational efficiencies, which have resulted in headcount reductions and office consolidations. as a result, we recognized $

we did not recognize any restructuring and related organization charges during 2022. we continue to evaluate additional cost reduction efforts and should we make decisions in future periods to take further actions we may incur additional reorganization charges.

table of contents note 15 - commitments and contingencies letters of credit, purchase obligations and guarantees we have commitments and obligations that include purchase obligations, guarantees and locs, which could potentially require our payment in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events. the following table presents these commitments and obligations as of december 31, 2022:
letters of credit                     44              42            2            -       -
our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors.
these minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods. payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use.
we have guarantees which consist primarily of bonds relating to tax assessments that we are contesting as well as bonds required by certain foreign countries' aviation authorities for the potential non-delivery, by us, of packaged travel sold in those countries. the authorities also require that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel sold be bonded. our guarantees also include certain surety bonds related to various company performance obligations.
our locs consist of stand-by locs, underwritten by a group of lenders, which we primarily issue for certain regulatory purposes as well as to certain hotel properties to secure our payment for hotel room transactions. the contractual expiration dates of these locs are shown in the table above. there were no material claims made against any stand-by locs during the years ended december 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various lawsuits. management does not expect these lawsuits to have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of expedia group. we also evaluate other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax, excise tax, sales tax, transient occupancy or accommodation tax and similar matters. we do not believe that the aggregate amount of liability that could be reasonably possible with respect to these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial results;
however, litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual losses incurred in the event that our legal proceedings were to result in unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.
litigation relating to occupancy taxes. one hundred threelawsuits have been filed by or against cities, counties and states involving hotel occupancy and other taxes. eightlawsuits are currently active. these lawsuits are in various stages and we continue to defend against the claims made in them vigorously. with respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. we believe that the statutes or ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations. to date, forty-nineof these lawsuits have been dismissed. some of these dismissals have been without prejudice and, generally, allow the governmental entity or entities to seek administrative remedies prior to pursuing further litigation. thirty-
fourdismissals were based on a finding that we and the other defendants were not subject to the local tax ordinance or that the local government lacked standing to pursue its claims. as a result of this litigation and other attempts by certain jurisdictions to levy such taxes, we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other taxes, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $ 44million and $ 50million as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. our settlement reserve is based on our best estimate of probable losses and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded. an estimate for a reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount reserved cannot be made. changes to the settlement reserve are included within legal reserves, occupancy tax and other in the consolidated statements of operations.
pay-to-play. certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as
table of contents made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. if we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.
we are in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities, some of which, including in the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes, may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.
matters relating to international vat . we are in various stages of inquiry or audit in multiple european union jurisdictions regarding the application of vat to our european union related transactions. while we believe we comply with applicable vat laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes. in certain jurisdictions, including the united kingdom, we may be required to "pay-to-play" any vat assessment prior to contesting its validity. while we believe that we will be successful based on the merits of our positions with regard to audits in pay-to-play jurisdictions, it is nevertheless reasonably possible that we could be required to pay any assessed amounts in order to contest or litigate the applicability of any assessments and an estimate for a reasonably possible amount of any such payments cannot be made.
competition and consumer matters . on august 23, 2018, the australian competition and consumer commission, or
"accc", instituted proceedings in the australian federal court against trivago. the accc alleged breaches of australian consumer law, or "acl," relating to trivago's advertisements in australia concerning the hotel prices available on trivago's australian site, trivago's strike-through pricing practice and other aspects of the way offers for accommodation were displayed on trivago's australian website. on january 20, 2020, the australian federal court issued a judgment finding trivago had engaged in conduct in breach of the acl. on october 18 and 19,
2021, the court heard submissions from the parties regarding penalties and other orders. on april 22, 2022, the australian federal court issued a judgment ordering trivago to pay a penalty of au$ 44.7million, which was paid in the second quarter of 2022, and to cover the accc's costs arising from the proceedings. the court also enjoined trivago from engaging in misleading conduct of the type found by the australian federal court to be in contravention of the acl. we recorded an estimated loss of approximately $ 11million with respect to these proceedings in a previous period and an additional loss of approximately $ 23million during the first quarter of
2022, for a total of approximately $ 34million previously included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of march 31, 2022.
note 16 - divestitures we had no disposition activity during 2022.
on november 1, 2021, we completed the sale of egencia, expedia group's corporate travel arm included within our b2b segment, to gbt. as a result of the sale, we deconsolidated egencia, recognized a gain of $ 401million within gain
(loss) on sale of business, net in the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december 31, 2021
and divested cash and restricted cash of $ 88million. we received no cash for this transaction but on the date of sale expedia group became an indirect holder of an approximately 19% interest of gbt with an initial fair value of
$ 815million, and a subsidiary entered into a 10-yearlodging supply agreement with gbt. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recognized an immaterial gain of approximately $ 6million related to this transaction. see note 3 - fair value measurements for additional information on our ongoing investment.
in addition, during 2020 and 2021, in connection with our efforts to focus on our core businesses and streamline our activities, we committed to plans to divest certain smaller businesses primarily within our retail segment. as a result, in 2020, we completed the sale of certain smaller businesses, including bodybuilding.com and silverrail, which combined resulted in a net losses of $ 13million and net cash divested of $ 21million. in 2021, we completed additional sales including classic vacations and alice, which combined resulted in net gains of $ 57million and net cash received of $ 27million. the resulting gains and losses in these transactions were recorded within gain (loss)
on sale of business, net in the consolidated statement of operations.
none of these dispositions were considered a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations or financial results and they did not represent individually significant components of our business; therefore, they have not been reported as discontinued operations.
note 17 - related party transactions iac/interactivecorp the company and iac are related parties because mr. diller serves as chairman and senior executive of both expedia group and iac. at december 31, 2022, each of expedia group and iac has a 50% ownership interest in twoaircraft that may be used by both companies. members of the aircraft flight crews are employed by an entity in which the company and iac each have a 50% ownership interest. the company and iac have agreed to share costs relating to flight crew compensation f- 37

in addition, in december 2021, we entered into agreements pursuant to which we may use additional aircraft owned by a subsidiary of iac on a cost basis. total payments made to this entity by the company were not material.
46million and $ 60million, respectively, recorded in long-term investments and other assets. in 2022, 2021 and
2020, operating and maintenance costs paid directly to the jointly-owned subsidiary for the aircraft were not material.
note 18 - segment information we have the following reportable segments: retail, b2b, and trivago. our retail segment, which consists of the aggregation of operating segments, provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including: expedia.com and hotels.com in the united states and localized expedia and hotels.com websites throughout the world, vrbo, orbitz, travelocity, wotif group, ebookers, cheaptickets, hotwire.com and carrentals.com. our b2b segment is comprised of expedia partner solutions, which offers private label and co-branded products to make travel services available to travelers through third-party company branded websites, and egencia (until its sale in november 2021), a full-service travel management company that provides travel services to businesses and their corporate customers. our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites.
we determined our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. our primary operating metric is adjusted ebitda. adjusted ebitda for our retail and b2b segments includes allocations of certain expenses, primarily related to our global travel supply organization and the majority of costs from our product and technology platform, as well as facility costs and the realized foreign currency gains or losses related to the forward contracts hedging a component of our net merchant lodging revenue. we base the allocations primarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics. we do not allocate certain shared expenses such as accounting, human resources, certain information technology and legal to our reportable segments. we include these expenses in corporate and eliminations. our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change.
our segment disclosure includes intersegment revenues, which primarily consist of advertising and media services provided by our trivago segment to our retail segment. these intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at amounts that approximate fair value as if the transactions were between third parties, and therefore, impact segment performance. however, the revenue and corresponding expense are eliminated in consolidation. the elimination of such intersegment transactions is included within corporate and eliminations in the table below.
corporate and eliminations also includes unallocated corporate functions and expenses as well as bodybuilding.com through its sale in may 2020. in addition, we record amortization of intangible assets and any related impairment, as well as stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and related reorganization charges, legal reserves, occupancy tax and other, and other items excluded from segment operating performance in corporate and eliminations.

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021. all percentages within this section are calculated on actual, unrounded numbers.
trends the covid-19 pandemic, and measures to contain the virus, including government travel restrictions and quarantine orders, had an unprecedented impact on the global travel industry and materially and negatively impacted our business, financial results and financial condition. with the evolution of milder covid-19 variants, availability of multiple vaccine booster doses and increasing familiarity with the virus, many covid-19 related travel restrictions have been lifted, and countries around the world reopened their borders for foreign travel.
however, we note that the recovery has been uneven, with different regions experiencing different rates of recovery. despite positive developments, the full duration and total impact of covid-19 remains uncertain, and therefore it is difficult to predict any future impact on the travel industry and, in particular, our business.
more recently, inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the u.s. and the global economy, such as rising interest rates, appreciation of the dollar, energy price volatility and inflationary pressures, have contributed to an increasingly complex macroeconomic environment. our future operational results may be subject to volatility, particularly in the short-term, due to the impact of the aforementioned trends. broad, sustained negative economic impacts could put strain on our suppliers, business and service partners, which increases the risk of credit losses and service level or other disruptions.
additionally, further health-related events, political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, sustained levels of increased inflation, sovereign debt issues, and natural disasters, are examples of other events that could have a negative impact on the travel industry in the future.
despite these factors, we have witnessed a healthy recovery of travel demand, which remains strong and is attributable to factors including pent-up demand from the covid-19 pandemic, and consumers prioritizing spend on travel and experiences over other discretionary spending.
we have also executed cost savings initiatives aimed at simplifying the organization and increasing efficiency, achieving by 2021 forward annualized run-rate fixed cost savings of $700 to $750 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 exit rate, as well as greater than $200 million in variable costs savings, at 2019 volume levels.
we also believe we have improved our marketing efficiency and continue to evaluate additional opportunities to increase efficiency and improve operational effectiveness across the company. as a result of these initiatives, and a near full recovery in travel bookings, we have experienced increases in adjusted ebitda margins, profitability and operating cash flows in excess of historic levels.
for additional information about our business strategy for expedia group, see the disclosure set forth in part i.
item 1. business, under the caption "market opportunity and business strategy."
online travel increased usage and familiarity with the internet have continued to drive rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. online penetration is higher in the u.s. and western european markets with online penetration rates in some emerging markets, such as latin america and eastern european regions, lagging behind those regions.
emerging market online penetration rates increased through the covid-19 pandemic, and are expected to continue growing, which presents an attractive growth opportunity for our business, while also attracting many competitors to online travel. this competition
table of contents intensified in recent years, and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.
in addition to the growth of online travel agencies, we have seen increased interest in the online travel industry from search engine companies such as google, evidenced by continued product enhancements, and prioritizing its own adwords and metasearch products such as, google hotel ads and google flights, in search results. competitive entrants such as "metasearch" companies, including kayak.com (owned by booking holdings), trivago (in which expedia group owns a majority interest) as well as tripadvisor, introduced differentiated features, pricing and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies, as well as various forms of direct or assisted booking tools. further, airlines and lodging companies are aggressively pursuing direct online distribution of their products and services. in addition, the increasing popularity of the "sharing economy," accelerated by online penetration, has had a direct impact on the travel and lodging industry. businesses such as airbnb, vrbo and booking.com have emerged as the leaders, bringing incremental alternative accommodation and vacation rental inventory to the market. other competitors have arisen, including vacation rental property managers such as vacasa, who operate their own booking sites in addition to listing on airbnb, vrbo, and booking.com, and are expected to continue to grow as a percentage of the global accommodation market. additionally, traditional consumer ecommerce players have expanded their local offerings by adding hotel offers to their websites. most recently, ride sharing app uber has added transportation and experience offerings to its app via partnerships with other travel providers.
the online travel industry also saw the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers, which in some cases place pressure on historical business models. in particular, the agency hotel model saw rapid adoption in europe. expedia group facilitates both merchant (expedia collect) and agency (hotel collect) hotel offerings with our hotel supply partners through both agency-only contracts as well as our hybrid etp program, which offers travelers the choice of whether to pay expedia group at the time of booking or pay the hotel at the time of stay.
in 2022, we began evolving our strategy from being largely transactionally focused, where we were primarily focused on acquiring customers through performance channels, to building a direct relationship with our customers by allocating more marketing spend towards our loyalty programs, paid app downloads, and brand awareness. while we maintain a large portfolio of consumer brands, we put the majority of our marketing efforts towards our three core consumer brands: expedia, hotels.com, and vrbo.
for more detail, see part i, item 1a, risk factors - "we rely on the value of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing" and "our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as our business expands globally."
lodging lodging includes both hotel and alternative accommodations. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2022, lodging accounted for 76%. as a result of the impact on travel demand from the covid-19 outbreak, room nights stayed grew 29% in 2022, as compared to a growth of 35% in 2021 and a decline of 55% in 2020. adrs for rooms stayed for expedia group increased 3% in 2020, increased 20% in 2021 and increased 7% in 2022. over the last couple of years, our lodging business saw a significant increase in adrs compared to pre-pandemic levels, which were driven by broader industry trends, a mix shift to vrbo and high adr geographies. vrbo carries a higher adr than hotels and has accounted for a higher percentage of room nights due to the faster recovery and shift to alternative accommodations during these periods.
as of december 31, 2022, our global lodging marketplace had approximately 3 million lodging properties available, including over 2 million online bookable alternative accommodations listings through vrbo and approximately 900,000
hotel. we generate the majority of our revenue through the facilitation of hotel reservations (stand-alone and package bookings). our relationships and overall economics with hotel supply partners have been broadly stable in recent years. as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our global hotel offering, in some cases we have reduced our economics in various geographies based on local market conditions. these impacts are due to specific initiatives intended to drive greater global size and scale through faster overall room night growth. additionally, increased promotional activities such as growing loyalty programs, discounting, and couponing have contributed to declines in revenue per room night and profitability in certain cases.
since our hotel supplier agreements are generally negotiated on a percentage basis, any increase or decrease in adrs has an impact on the revenue we earn per room night. strong pent-up demand and high operating costs during
2022 drove a 14% increase in the u.s. hotel industry adrs versus 2019, according to smith travel research (str). in the future, we could see macroeconomic factors influence hotel adr trends, including as the rising living costs due to inflation and higher interest rates. other factors that could lead to moderating adrs include growth in hotel supply and the increase in alternative accommodation inventory. further, while the global lodging industry remains very fragmented, there has been consolidation in the hotel space among chains as well as ownership groups. in the meantime, certain hotel chains have been focusing on driving direct bookings
table of contents on their own websites and mobile applications by advertising lower rates than those available on third-party websites as well as incentives such as loyalty programs, increased or exclusive product availability and complimentary benefits.
alternative accommodations. with our acquisition of vrbo (previously homeaway) and all of its brands in december
2015, we expanded into the fast-growing alternative accommodations market. vrbo is a leader in this market, specializing in unique whole home inventory, primarily in north american leisure markets, and represents an attractive growth opportunity for expedia group.
vrbo has transitioned from a listings-based classified advertising model to an online transactional model that optimizes for both travelers and homeowner and property manager partners, with a goal of increasing monetization and driving growth through investments in marketing as well as in product and technology. vrbo offers hosts subscription-based listing or pay-per-booking service models. it also generates revenue from a traveler service fee for bookings.
air similar to the rest of travel, the airlines experienced a surge in pent-up demand, however they have been operating at reduced capacity due to staffing shortages, supply chain disruptions, and elevated fuel costs. in 2022, the reduced airline capacity and high operating costs drove average u.s. domestic airfares up approximately 10%
compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to airlines reporting corporation (arc) data. while air bookings improved in 2022 relative to 2021, our air business continues to lag lodging bookings and remains below 2019
in addition, we could encounter pressure on air remuneration as air carriers combine, certain supply agreements renew, and as we continue to add airlines to ensure local coverage in new markets.
air ticket volumes increased 8% in 2022 and increased 43% during 2021, compared to a decline of 63% in 2020. as a percentage of our total worldwide revenue in 2022, air accounted for 3%.
advertising & media our advertising and media business is principally driven by revenue generated by trivago, a leading hotel metasearch website, and expedia group media solutions, which is responsible for generating advertising revenue on our global online travel brands. in 2022, we generated $777 million of advertising and media revenue, a 29%
since the onset of covid-19, online travel agencies, including ourselves, have reduced marketing spend on trivago.
in response, trivago has reduced its own marketing spend and lowered operating costs to preserve profitability. we expect trivago to continue to experience revenue pressure going forward.
seasonality we generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel services. for example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and winter holiday travel. the number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. since revenue for most of our travel services, including merchant and agency hotel, is recognized as the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks for our hotel business and can be several months or more for our alternative accommodations business. historically, vrbo has seen seasonally stronger bookings in the first quarter of the year, with the relevant stays occurring during the peak summer travel months. the seasonal revenue impact is exacerbated with respect to income by the nature of our variable cost of revenue and direct sales and marketing costs, which we typically realize in closer alignment to booking volumes, and the more stable nature of our fixed costs. as a result on a consolidated basis, revenue and income are typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter.
the growth in our b2b segment, international operations, advertising business or a change in our product mix, among others, may also influence the typical trend of seasonality in the future. significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes from covid-19 disrupted our typical seasonal pattern for bookings, revenue, profit and cash flows from 2020 through early 2022, but have generally returned to historic seasonality.
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported.
table of contents we base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
there are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:
• it requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and
• changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
for more information on each of these policies, see note 2 - significant accounting policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements. we discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below.
accounting for certain merchant revenue we accrue the cost of certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. in certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally reduce our merchant accounts payable and the supplier costs within net revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience. actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing practices or changes in traveler behavior.
deferred loyalty rewards we currently offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our travelers, such as our hotels.com rewards program, our expedia rewards program and our orbitz rewards program. hotels.com rewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions. expedia rewards enables participating travelers to earn points on all hotel, flight, package and activities made on various brand expedia websites. orbitz rewards allows travelers to earn orbucks, the currency of orbitz rewards, on flights, hotels and vacation packages and instantly redeem those orbucks on future bookings at various hotels worldwide. in 2021, we announced plans to unify and expand our existing loyalty programs into one global rewards platform called "one key" spanning all our main brands, which we expect to launch in 2023. as travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we defer the relative standalone selling price of earned points, net of expected breakage, as deferred loyalty rewards within deferred merchant bookings on the consolidated balance sheet. in order to estimate the standalone selling price of the underlying services on which points can be redeemed for all loyalty programs, we use an adjusted market assessment approach and consider the redemption values expected from the traveler. we then estimate the number of rewards that will not be redeemed based on historical activity in our members' accounts as well as statistical modeling techniques. revenue is recognized when we have satisfied our performance obligation relating to the points, that is when the travel service purchased with the loyalty award is satisfied. both the actual standalone selling price of the underlying services and ultimate redemption rates could differ materially from our estimates due to a number of factors, including fluctuations in reward value, product utilization and divergence from historical member behavior.
recoverability of goodwill and indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets goodwill . we assess goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1, or more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. during 2020, as a result of the significant turmoil related to covid-19, we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require us to perform multiple interim impairment assessments. in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we typically perform a quantitative assessment and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value and, if applicable, record an impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. periodically, we may choose to perform a qualitative assessment, prior to performing the quantitative analysis, to determine whether the fair value of the goodwill is more likely than not impaired.
we generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units, except for trivago, which is a separately listed company on the nasdaq global select market, on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach with the exception of our standalone publicly traded subsidiary, which is based on market valuation. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying
table of contents similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. the fair value estimate for the trivago reporting unit was based on trivago's stock price, a level
1 input, adjusted for an estimated control premium.
we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.
in addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our reporting units in relation to the company's total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. the debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.
indefinite-lived intangible assets . we base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.
definite-lived intangible assets. we review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.
the use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in an impairment or, in the period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge.
for additional information on our goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2022, 2021 and 2020, see note 3 - fair value measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes we record income taxes under the liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. we determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense.
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates. all deferred income taxes are classified as long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.
we account for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process of evaluating recognition and measurement criteria. the first step assesses whether the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the tax authority, including resolution of any appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the position. if the tax position meets the more
table of contents likely than not criteria, the portion of the tax benefit greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority is recognized in the financial statements. the ultimate resolution of these tax positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.
other long-term liabilities various legal and tax contingencies . we record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities. in addition, we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. these liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. the determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible loss. in addition, our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel. the ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.
occupancy and other taxes . some states and localities impose taxes (e.g. transient occupancy, accommodation tax, sales tax and/or business privilege tax) on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations or other traveler services. generally, hotels collect taxes based on the rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. when a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. we calculate the tax recovery charge by applying the applicable tax rate supplied to us by the hotels to the amount that the hotel has agreed to receive for the rental of the room by the consumer. in most jurisdictions, we do not collect or remit taxes, nor do we pay taxes to the hotel operator, on the portion of the customer payment we retain. some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard.
while the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required to pay such taxes. a limited number of taxing jurisdictions have made similar claims against certain of our companies for tax amounts due on the rental amounts charged by owners of alternative accommodations properties or for taxes on our services. we are an intermediary between a traveler and a party renting an alternative accommodations property and we believe are similarly not liable for such taxes. we are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve these issues. some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit tax. the ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments, including occupancy and other transactional tax assessments, prior to contesting any such assessments.
we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation for prior and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. a variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not limited to, the number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes.
we note that there are more than 10,000 taxing jurisdictions in the united states, and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes, regulations and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction. rather, we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue. many of the statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the emergence of the internet and ecommerce. certain jurisdictions have enacted, and others may enact, legislation regarding the imposition of taxes on businesses that facilitate the booking of hotel or alternative accommodations. we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. we will continue to monitor the issue closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level of reserves, as developments warrant.
additionally, certain of our businesses are involved in tax related litigation, which is discussed in part i, item
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see note 2 - significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
occupancy and other taxes we are currently involved in eight lawsuits brought by or against states, cities and counties over issues involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other taxes. we continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. with respect to the principal claims in these matters, we believe that the statutes and/or ordinances at issue do not apply to us or the services we provide, namely the facilitation of travel planning and reservations, and, therefore, that we do not owe the taxes that are claimed to be owed. we believe that the statutes and ordinances at issue generally impose occupancy and other taxes on entities that own, operate or control hotels (or similar businesses) or furnish or provide hotel rooms or similar accommodations.
table of contents for additional information and other recent developments on these and other legal proceedings, see part i, item 3, legal proceedings.
we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy and other tax litigation, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances, in the amount of $44 million as of december 31, 2022 and $50 million as of december 31, 2021.
certain jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of new york, new jersey, north carolina, minnesota, oregon, rhode island, maryland, pennsylvania, hawaii, iowa, massachusetts, arizona, wisconsin, idaho, arkansas, indiana, maine, nebraska, vermont, mississippi, virginia, the city of new york, and the district of columbia, have enacted legislation seeking to tax online travel company services as part of sales or other taxes for hotel and/or other accommodations and/or car rental. in addition, in certain jurisdictions, we have entered into voluntary collection agreements pursuant to which we have agreed to voluntarily collect and remit taxes to state and/or local taxing jurisdictions. we are currently remitting taxes to a number of jurisdictions, including without limitation the states of new york, new jersey, south carolina, north carolina, minnesota, georgia, wyoming, west virginia, oregon, rhode island, montana, maryland, kentucky, maine, pennsylvania, hawaii, iowa, massachusetts, arizona, wisconsin, idaho, arkansas, indiana, nebraska, vermont, colorado, mississippi, virginia, the city of new york and the district of columbia, as well as certain other jurisdictions.
pay-to-play certain jurisdictions may assert that we are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances. this prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as "pay-to-
play." payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we continue to defend our position vigorously. if we prevail in the litigation, for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest. however, any significant pay-to-play payment or litigation loss could negatively impact our liquidity.
other jurisdictions. we are also in various stages of inquiry or audit with various tax authorities, some of which, including the city of los angeles regarding hotel occupancy taxes, may impose a pay-to-play requirement to challenge an adverse inquiry or audit result in court.
segments we have the following reportable segments: retail, b2b, and trivago. our retail segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of consumer brands including:
expedia.com and hotels.com in the united states and localized expedia and hotels.com websites throughout the world, vrbo, orbitz, travelocity, wotif group, ebookers, cheaptickets, hotwire.com, and carrentals.com. our b2b segment is comprised of expedia partner solutions, which offers private label and co-branded products to make travel services available to travelers through third-party company branded websites, and, through its sale in november 2021, egencia, a full-service travel management company that provided travel services to businesses and their corporate customers. our trivago segment generates advertising revenue primarily from sending referrals to online travel companies and travel service providers from its hotel metasearch websites.
operating metrics our operating results are affected by certain metrics, such as gross bookings and revenue margin, which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating us. gross bookings generally represent the total retail value of transactions booked for agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are reduced for cancellations and refunds. revenue margin is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.

adjusted ebitda is our primary segment operating metric. see note 18 - segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on intersegment transactions, unallocated overhead costs and for a
table of contents reconciliation of adjusted ebitda by segment to net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. for the periods presented above.
our retail, b2b and trivago segments all experienced improvements in adjusted ebitda in 2022 as a result of the recovering travel demand. in addition, the b2b segment improved in part due to the absence of the prior year adjusted ebitda loss related to egencia. unallocated overhead costs increased $33 million during 2022 primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses.

rate our effective tax rate for 2022 was higher than the 21% federal statutory income tax rate due to a valuation allowance on minority investments and nondeductible compensation, partially offset by research and experimentation credits. our effective tax rate for 2021 was higher than the 21% federal statutory income tax rate due to excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, release of valuation allowance and research and experimentation credits, partially offset by nondeductible compensation, measured against a pre-tax loss. for additional information, see note 10 - income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
we are subject to taxation in the united states and foreign jurisdictions. our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. during the fourth quarter of 2019, the internal revenue service ("irs") issued final adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2011 to
2013 tax years. the adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by $696 million, which would result in federal tax of approximately $244 million, subject to interest. we do not agree with the position of the irs. we have formally filed a protest for our 2011 to 2013 tax years and the case has been transferred to appeals. during the fourth quarter of 2022, the irs issued similar proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for our 2014 to 2016 tax years. the adjustments would increase our u.s. taxable income by
$1.413 billion, which would result in federal tax of approximately $494 million, subject to interest. the proposed adjustments provided by the irs exclude any offsetting adjustments that may reduce the amount of federal tax. we do not agree with the position of the irs and intend to formally protest. we are also under examination by the irs for our 2017-2020 years. we believe it is reasonably possible that the audit of the 2011 and 2013 tax years will conclude within the next 12 months. for more detail on our tax risk factors, see part i, item 1a, risk factors - "a failure to comply with current laws, rules and regulations or changes to such laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business, financial performance, results of operations or business growth" and "application of existing tax laws, rules or regulations are subject to interpretation by taxing authorities."
definition and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda we report adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
adjusted ebitda is among the primary metrics by which management evaluates the performance of the business and on which internal budgets are based. management believes that investors should have access to the same set of tools that management uses to analyze our results. this non-gaap measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap. adjusted ebitda has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. we endeavor to compensate for the limitation of the non-gaap measure presented by also providing the most directly comparable gaap measure and a description of the reconciling items and adjustments to derive the non-gaap measure. adjusted ebitda also excludes certain items related to transactional tax matters, which may ultimately be settled in cash, and we urge investors to review the detailed disclosure regarding these matters included above, in the legal proceedings section, as well as the notes to the financial statements. the non-gaap financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. adjusted for (1) net income
(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests; (2) provision for income taxes; (3) total other expenses, net;
(4) stock-based compensation expense, including compensation expense related to certain subsidiary equity plans;
(5) acquisition-related impacts, including (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment, (ii) gains (losses) recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, if any, and (iii) upfront consideration paid to settle employee compensation plans of the acquiree, if any; (6)
certain other items, including restructuring; (7) items included in legal reserves, occupancy tax and other; (8)
that portion of gains (losses) on revenue hedging activities that are included in other, net that relate to revenue recognized in the period; and (9) depreciation.
the above items are excluded from our adjusted ebitda measure because these items are noncash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items is unpredictable, not driven by core operating results and renders comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. we believe adjusted ebitda is a useful measure for analysts and investors to evaluate our future on-going performance as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison of our performance and projected cash earnings with our historical results from prior periods and to the results of our competitors. moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments. in addition, we believe that by excluding certain items, such as stock-
based compensation and acquisition-related
table of contents impacts, adjusted ebitda corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business and allows investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the ongoing cash earnings capabilities of our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to expedia group, inc. to adjusted ebitda is as follows:

financial position, liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are typically cash flows generated from operations, cash available under our credit facility as well as our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, which were $4.1
billion and $4.3 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021. our revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of
as of december 31, 2022, the total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the united states was $770 million ($456 million in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and $314 million in majority-owned subsidiaries). the amount of undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries where the foreign subsidiary has or will invest undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the unites states, and for which future distributions could be taxable, was $65 million as of december 31, 2022. the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the u.s. federal income tax consequences of these earnings was $17 million as of december 31, 2022.
• redemption of 2.5% senior notes. in march 2022, we early redeemed all of the €650 million of outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.5% senior notes due in june 2022. the redemption price for the 2.5% senior notes equaled 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date.
• redemption of 3.6% and 4.5% senior notes. in may 2022, we early redeemed all of our $500 million 3.6% senior notes due 2023, and in june 2022, we early redeemed all of our $500 million 4.5% senior notes due 2024, which resulted in the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of $24 million primarily comprised of "make-whole"
premiums as well as the write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs.
• redemption of 2.95% senior notes. in september 2022, we settled the tender offer to purchase $500 million in aggregate principal of our 2.95% senior notes due 2031 for an aggregate cash repurchase price of approximately $418
million, which resulted in the recognition of a net gain on debt extinguishment of $73 million. the net gain included the write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs as well as related fees.
our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. as of december 31, 2022, moody's rating was baa3
with an outlook of "stable," s&p's rating was bbb- with an outlook of "stable" and fitch's rating was bbb- with an outlook of "stable." changes in our operating results, cash flows, financial position, capital structure, financial policy or capital allocations to share repurchase, dividends, investments and acquisitions could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies.
table of contents should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur higher costs to borrow and/or limited access to capital markets and interest rates on our 6.25% senior notes, 4.625% senior notes as well as our 2.95% senior notes will increase, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions in our revolving credit facilities and outstanding debt as detailed in note 7 - debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred merchant bookings. we pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction. for most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant lodging business, we generally pay after the travelers' use and, in some cases, subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers. therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. typically, the seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings have affected the timing of our annual cash flows. generally, during the first half of the year, hotel bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. during the second half of the year, this pattern typically reverses and cash flows are typically negative. during 2020, impacts of covid-19 disrupted our typical working capital trends. significantly higher cancellations and reduced booking volumes, particularly in the first half of 2020, resulted in material operating losses and negative cash flow. during 2022, booking and travel trends have nearly normalized resulting in working capital benefits and positive cash flow in the current period akin to typical historical trends. however, it remains difficult to forecast the working capital trends for the upcoming quarters, given the uncertainty related to the full duration and total impact of covid-19.
prior to covid-19, we embarked on an ambitious cost reduction initiative to simplify the organization and increase efficiency. in response to covid-19, we took several additional actions to further reduce costs to help mitigate the financial impact from covid-19 and continue to improve our long-term cost structure. for 2023, we expect total capital expenditures for the full year to increase relative to our 2022 spending levels as we look to continue to improve our technology platforms, infrastructure, operational capabilities, and in the development of service offerings and expansion of our operations.

on cash and cash equivalents in 2022, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $308 million primarily due to a decrease in benefits from working capital changes driven mostly from a change in deferred merchant booking, which was largely offset by higher operating income after adjusting for impacts of depreciation and amortization.
in 2022, $351 million less cash was used in investing activities primarily due to net sales and maturities of investments of $145 million in 2022 compared to net purchases of investments of $178 million in 2021.
cash used in financing activities in 2022 primarily included payments of $2.2 billion related to the extinguishment of our 2.5% senior notes, 3.6% senior notes, 4.5% senior notes and the tender offer for a portion of our 2.95%
senior notes discussed above as well as $607 million of cash paid to acquire shares, including the repurchased shares under the authorizations discussed below and for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments. these uses of cash were partially offset by $131 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans. cash used in financing activities in 2021 primarily included payments of approximately $2 billion related to the extinguishment of debt and $1.2 billion for the redemption of preferred stock as well as $165 million of cash paid for treasury stock activity related to the vesting of equity instruments and $67 million in preferred stock dividends. these uses of cash were largely offset by approximately $2 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and 2.95% senior notes issued in february and march 2021, respectively, as well as $503 million of proceeds from the exercise of options and employee stock purchase plans.
our board of directors and the executive committee, pursuant to a delegation of authority from the board, have authorized share repurchases under authorized programs. these programs were temporarily halted in early 2020 with the onset of the covid-19 pandemic but resumed in the second half of 2022. shares repurchased under the authorized programs were as
(1) amount excludes transaction costs.
as of december 31, 2022, 18.1 million shares remain authorized for repurchase with no fixed termination date for the repurchases.
foreign exchange rate changes resulted in a decrease of our cash and restricted cash balances denominated in foreign currency in both 2022 and 2021 of $190 million and $177 million, respectively, reflecting a net depreciation in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar during each year.
contractual obligations and commercial commitments. our material cash requirements as of december 31, 2022 include the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments arising in the normal course of business:
• principal payments related to our debt that is included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments. the company had senior notes and convertible notes, as described in note 7 - debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, with varying maturities and an aggregate principal amount of
$6.3 billion, none of which is payable within 12 months. based on current stated fixed rates, future interest payments associated with the senior notes total approximately $1.1 billion, with approximately $231 million payable within 12 months;
• our operating leases had fixed lease payment obligations, including imputed interest, of $443 million, with $88
million payable within 12 months; and
• purchase obligations representing the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners. these minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods, and payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use. the company had purchase obligations of $466 million, with $292 million payable within 12 months.
in addition, we had $284 million of net unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our balance sheet as of december 31,
2022, for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment.
see note 15 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our purchase obligations as well as amounts outstanding as of december 31, 2022 related to letters of credit and guarantees. other than the items described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2022.
in our opinion, our liquidity position provides sufficient capital resources to meet our foreseeable cash needs.
there can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, including refinancings, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us.

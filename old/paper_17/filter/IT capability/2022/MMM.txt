item 1a. risk factors.
provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company. discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations."
* the company's results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, and other external conditions.
the company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the united states, and, accordingly, the company's operations and the execution of its business strategies and plans are subject to global competition and economic and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as, among other things, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, military conflicts, public health emergencies such as covid-19, political changes and trends such as protectionism, economic nationalism resulting in government actions impacting international trade agreements or imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, and government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in locations or industries in which the company operates. further escalation of specific trade tensions, including those between the u.s. and china, or more broadly in global trade conflict, could adversely impact the company's business and operations around the world. the company's business is also impacted by social, political, and labor conditions in locations in which the company or its suppliers or customers operate; adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital; monetary policy; interest rates; inflation; recession; commodity prices; currency volatility or exchange control; ability to expatriate earnings; and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company or its suppliers or customers operate. for example, changes in local economic condition or outlooks, such as lower economic growth rates in china, europe, or other key markets, impact the demand or profitability of the company's products.
the global economy has been impacted by the military conflict between russia and ukraine. the u.s. and other governments have imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in russia. 3m suspended operations of its subsidiaries in russia in march 2022 and, in september 2022, committed to a plan to exit the related net assets through an intended sale of the subsidiaries. 3m also has other operations that source certain raw materials from suppliers in russia and has experienced related supply disruption due to the conflict. these geopolitical tensions could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, further supply chain disruptions impacting downstream customers, higher energy costs, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect the company's business and supply chain.
climate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we or our suppliers or customers operate.
3m, as a global company, is impacted by unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism, public health crises (such as the covid-19 pandemic), civil unrest, natural disasters, and severe weather in the locations in which the company or its suppliers or customers operate, and these events have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the company's operations and financial performance. for example, the global pandemic associated with covid-19, including related evolving governmental responses to the pandemic, has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has impacted and will continue to impact 3m's operations, including its supply chain and its manufacturing and distribution capabilities. although covid-19 increased demand for certain 3m products, it also resulted in decreased demand from certain end markets, made it more difficult for 3m to serve customers, and resulted in conditions that had the potential to damage 3m's reputation, including third-party price gouging, counterfeiting, and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving 3m's products. furthermore, covid-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. as the pandemic evolves, demand for personal protection products such as disposable respirators has experienced a decline from prior levels. 3m is not able to predict the impact of unexpected events, such as the covid-19 pandemic, and unexpected events may have a material adverse effect on 3m's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
* foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company's ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings.
because the company's financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the company's revenues are derived from outside the united states, the company's results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the u.s. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. for a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the company, see part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
* the company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.
as previously reported, governments in the united states and internationally have increasingly been regulating a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the company, collectively known as "pfas." 3m has noticed several global regulatory trends related to pfas, including declining emission standards and limits set as to the presence of certain compounds in various media, and the inclusion of a broadening group of pfas. developments in these and other global regulatory trends may require additional actions by 3m, including investigation, remediation, and compliance, or may result in additional litigation and enforcement action costs.
the company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of certain pfas produced by the company.
the pfas group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical, and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. the strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. these characteristics have made pfas substances critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets, and semi-conductors. they are also used to help prevent contamination of medical products like surgical gowns and drapes. commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on pfas technology. pfas compounds are manufactured by various companies, including 3m, and are used in everyday products, including some manufactured by 3m. as science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that certain pfas compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3m announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of two pfas substances, perfluorooctanoate (pfoa) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos) globally as a precautionary measure. we phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the u.s. completed by the end of 2002. phased out products included aqueous film forming foam (afff) and certain coatings for food packaging, for example. the company continues to review, control, or eliminate the presence of certain pfas in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts of some of 3m's current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.
3m announced in december 2022 it will take two actions: exiting all pfas manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of pfas across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3m's decision is based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape, including multiple factors such as accelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of pfas in the environment and changing stakeholder expectations. the company recognized a $0.8 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 associated with this announcement related to asset impairments, and will incur additional expenses in connection with its exit activities. in addition, these two announced actions (the "exit") involve risks, including the actual timing, costs, and financial impact of such exit; the company's ability to complete such exit, on the anticipated timing or at all; potential governmental or regulatory actions relating to pfas manufacturing and production, or the company's exit plans; the company's ability to identify and manufacture acceptable substitutes for the discontinued products, and the possibility that such substitutes will not achieve the anticipated or desired commercial or operational results; potential litigation relating to the company's exit plans; and the possibility that the planned exit will involve greater costs than anticipated, or otherwise have negative impacts on the company's relationships with its customers and other counterparties.
3m currently is defending lawsuits concerning various pfas-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of pfas in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in note 16, "commitments and contingencies," within the notes to consolidated financial statements. 3m has seen increased public and private lawsuits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities, and utilities alleging, among other things, harm to the general public and damages to natural resources, some of which are pending in the aqueous film forming foam (afff) multi-district litigation and some of which are pending in other jurisdictions. various factors or developments in these and other disclosed actions could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on 3m. for example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the state of minnesota involving the presence of pfas in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. governmental inquiries, lawsuits, or laws and regulations involving pfas could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, including orders to conduct remediation, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities, requiring the installation of control technologies, suspension or shutdown of facility operations, switching costs in seeking alternative sources of supply, potential customer damage claims due to supply disruptions or otherwise, and reporting requirements or bans on pfas and pfas-containing products manufactured by the company.
* the company is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, as well as compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the company or its suppliers, vendors, or channel partners to conduct business in a certain way. the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company's ability to execute its strategy and its results of operations.
the company is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, including those involving product liability; antitrust; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-bribery laws; international import and export requirements and trade sanctions compliance; regulations of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and similar foreign agencies; u.s. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the false claims act, anti-kickback laws, and the sunshine act; and other matters. the company is also subject to compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the company and its suppliers, vendors, or channel parties, to conduct business in a certain way. legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the company's suppliers, vendors, or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3m's supplier responsibility code, 3m performance requirements, or with legal requirements.
the company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if the costs to comply with these evolving treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are greater than projected by the company. in addition, the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are difficult to reliably predict, may differ from the company's expectations, and can result in, among other things, criminal or civil sanctions, including fines; limitations on the extent to which the company can conduct business; and private rights of action that result in litigation exposure, including expenses and costs incurred in connection with settlement or court proceedings, for the company. although the company maintains general liability insurance to mitigate monetary exposure, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or cash flows. in addition, negative publicity related to the matters noted above or other matters involving the company may negatively impact the company's reputation. the company also relies on patent and other intellectual property protection, and challenges to the company's intellectual property rights, or claims that the company's activities interfere with the intellectual property rights of a third party, could cause the company to incur significant expenses to assert or defend against such claims, could result in reduced revenue, and could damage the company's reputation, any of which could have an adverse effect on the company. for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in note 16, "commitments and contingencies," within the notes to consolidated financial statements.
* the company's results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.
demand for the company's products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by, among other things, (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the company's pricing strategies; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers, vendors, or channel partners; (iv) changes in customers' preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the company's products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics, and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data.
* the company's growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.
this ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.
* the company's future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials, energy, and labor due to shortages, increased demand and wages, logistics, supply chain interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, regulatory developments, natural disasters, and other disruptive factors.
the company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts, natural and other disasters, and other disruptive events such as military conflicts, or be terminated. any sustained interruption in the company's receipt of adequate supplies, supply chain disruptions impacting the distribution of products, or disruption to key manufacturing sites' operations due to natural and other disasters or events, such as government actions relating to discharge or emission permits or other legal or regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on the company. in addition, there can be no assurance that the company's processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing will be successful or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company.
* the company employs information technology systems to support its business and collect, store, and use proprietary and confidential information, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (erp) system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. security and data breaches, cyberattacks, and other cybersecurity incidents involving the company's information technology systems and infrastructure could disrupt or interfere with the company's operations; result in the compromise and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information belonging to the company or its customers, suppliers, and employees; and expose the company to numerous expenses, liabilities, and other negative consequences, any or all of which could adversely impact the company's business, reputation, and results of operations.
in the ordinary course of business, the company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted, or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. additionally, the company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. third parties and threat actors, including organized criminals, nation-state, or nation-state supported actors, regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to the company's information technology networks and infrastructure, data, and other information, and many such attempts are increasingly sophisticated. despite our cybersecurity and business continuity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the company's information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially susceptible to attack, compromise, damage, disruption, or shutdown, including as a result of the exploitation of known or unknown hardware or software vulnerabilities in our systems or in the systems of our vendors and third-party service providers, the introduction of computer viruses or ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, phishing attempts, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. the company's increased adoption of remote working, initially driven by the pandemic, also introduces additional threats and risk of disruptions to our information technology networks and infrastructure. despite our cybersecurity measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities or a cyberattack to remain undetected for an extended time period, up to and including several years, and the prioritization of decisions with respect to security measures and remediation of known vulnerabilities that we and the vendors and other third parties upon which we rely make may prove inadequate to protect against attacks. while we and third parties we utilize have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyberattacks on and breaches and disruptions of the company's and the third parties' information technology systems and infrastructure, we do not believe that any such incidents to date have had a material impact on the company. any cybersecurity incident or information technology network disruption could result in numerous negative consequences, including the risk of legal claims or proceedings, investigations or enforcement actions by u.s., state, or foreign regulators; liabilities or penalties under applicable laws and regulations, including privacy laws and regulations in the u.s. and other jurisdictions; interference with the company's operations; the incurrence of remediation costs; loss of intellectual property protection; the loss of customer, supplier, or employee relationships; and damage to the company's reputation, any of which could adversely affect the company's business. although the company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.
* acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other strategic events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring, could affect future results.
the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and changes to its organizational structure. with respect to acquisitions and strategic alliances, future results will be affected by, as applicable, the company's ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies and the company's ability to operationalize and derive anticipated benefits from alliances. divestitures may include continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction, will result in the loss of revenue associated with the businesses that are divested, and may result in unexpected liabilities through indemnification or other risk-shifting mechanisms in the applicable divestiture agreement. any of the foregoing could adversely affect the company's future results.
* the company's future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the company generates fewer productivity improvements than planned.
the company's financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. the company utilizes various tools, such as continuous improvement, to improve productivity and reduce expenses and engages in ongoing global business transformation to improve operational efficiency, productivity, and the speed and efficiency with which it serves customers. this is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an erp system. there can be no assurance that we will realize the benefits of such activities, or that such activities will not result in unexpected consequences, such as a reduced ability to generate sales or provide the experience that our customers, suppliers, vendors, and channel partners expect from us. in addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes, including responding to evolving customer needs and service expectations, are important, and, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the company's ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3m's brand. operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial conditions and results of operations.
risks related to financial and capital markets and tax matters
* the company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.
the performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.
* change in the company's credit ratings could increase cost of funding.
the company's credit ratings are important to 3m's cost of capital. the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the company's credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m. this evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. as of december 2022, 3m has a credit rating of a1, stable outlook from moody's investors service, and a credit rating of a+, creditwatch negative from s&p global ratings. the company's credit ratings have served to lower 3m's borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. the addition of further leverage to the company's capital structure could impact 3m's credit ratings in the future. failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the company's cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.
the company's business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, and assessment and enforcement approaches. in addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from u.s. or international tax reform legislation could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the company's consolidated statement of earnings. in connection with the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) integrated framework provided by organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. due to the evolving nature of global tax laws and regulations and compliance approaches, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements, but these actions could have an adverse impact on the company's financial results.
table of contents risks related to the voluntary chapter 11 proceedings initiated by the company's aearo entities
* the company is subject to risks related to its subsidiaries' chapter 11 proceedings.
on july 26, 2022, aearo technologies and certain of its related entities ("aearo entities"), all wholly owned subsidiaries of the company, voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings seeking bankruptcy court supervision to establish a trust - funded by the company - to address potential liabilities related to dual-ended combat arms - version 2 earplugs and mask/respirator products historically manufactured and sold by aearo entities. this represents a change in strategy for managing the combat arms version 2 earplugs and aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities. aearo entities were acquired by the company in 2008 and they, along with its related subsidiaries, have operated as company subsidiaries since that time. 3m has entered into a funding agreement with aearo entities and committed to fund a trust to satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation, and to support aearo entities as they continue to operate during the chapter 11 proceedings. there are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the chapter 11 proceedings, including, among others, those related to: legal risks related to the chapter 11 proceedings; potential impacts to the company's reputation and relationships with its customers, suppliers, federal contracting officials, employees, regulators, and other counterparties and community members; impacts to the company's liquidity or results of operations, including risks related to the amount that will be necessary to fully and finally resolve all of the company's obligations to make payments to resolve such claims under the terms of its funding and indemnification agreement with aearo entities; the costs of chapter 11 proceedings and length of time necessary to resolve the cases; and aearo entities' ability to reach acceptable agreements with claimants and navigate the chapter 11 proceedings to obtain approval and consummation of a plan of reorganization. due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the company cannot predict the timing, outcome, or financial impact of this matter, or any other ongoing or future litigation.
* the company is subject to risks related to its plan to spin off its health care business.
on july 26, 2022, the company announced its intent to spin off its health care business, resulting in two standalone public companies, in a transaction that is intended to be tax-free for the company's stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including final approval by the company's board of directors, the filing and effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service and a tax opinion from external counsel, and other customary conditions. the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, many of which are outside of the company's control, could delay the completion of the spin-off relative to the anticipated timeline or prevent it from occurring. any delay in the completion of the spin-off or any change to the anticipated terms of the transaction could reduce the expected benefits of the transaction, or delay the time at which such benefits are realized. there can also be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized if the spin-off is completed, or that the costs or dis-synergies of the transaction (including costs of related restructuring transactions), will not exceed the anticipated amounts. whether or not the spin-off is ultimately completed, the pendency of the transaction may impose challenges on the company and its business, including potential business disruption; the diversion of management time on matters relating to the transaction; the impact on the company's ability to retain talent; and potential impacts on the company's relationships with its customers, employees, regulators, and other counterparties. in addition, while it is intended that the transaction would be tax-free to the company's stockholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this treatment. if the spin-off was ultimately determined to be taxable, the company, the health care business, or the company's stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. any of these factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is designed to provide a reader of 3m's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3m's md&a is presented in eight sections:
•critical accounting estimates
•financial condition and liquidity
•financial instruments forward-looking statements in item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled "cautionary note concerning factors that may affect future results" in item 1 and the risk factors provided in item 1a for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).
additional information about results of operations and financial condition for 2021 and 2020 can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" sections in 3m's current report on form 8-k dated april 26, 2022 (which updated 3m's 2021 annual report on form 10-k).
•changes in measure of segment operating performance used by 3m's chief operating decision maker-impacting 3m's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). see additional information in note 19. 3m's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in segment reporting. see additional information in note 2.
•changes to non-gaap measures - certain amounts adjusted for special items. refer to the certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-gaap measures) section below for additional information.
3m manages its operations in four operating business segments: safety and industrial; transportation and electronics; health care; and consumer. from a geographic perspective, any references to emea refer to europe, middle east and africa on a combined basis. references are made to organic sales change (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. 3m believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.
3m is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (covid-19). risk factors with respect to covid-19 can be found in item 1a "risk factors" in this document. given the diversity of 3m's businesses, some of the factors relative to covid-19 increase the demand for 3m products, while others decrease demand or make it more difficult for 3m to serve customers. certain resulting impacts are referenced in various discussions within this item 7. overall, the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on 3m's consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. 3m is not able to predict the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in 2022, 3m's costs for significant litigation (see certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-gaap measures section below) totaled approximately $2.3 billion pre-tax and included, among things, pre-tax charges associated with steps toward resolving combat arms earplugs litigation and associated with additional commitments to address pfas-related matters at its zwijndrecht, belgium site (approximately $1.3 billion and $355 million, respectively, in 2022). these matters are further discussed in note 16. in 2022, 3m also completed the split-off of its food safety division business resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion and committed to a plan to exit pfas manufacturing by the end of 2025 resulting in a 2022 pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion related to impairment as discussed in note 15. see certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-gaap measures) section below for additional discussion of these and other special items.
3m belgium has experienced interruptions to portions of the manufacturing at its site in zwijndrecht, belgium, as more fully discussed in note 16. as discussed in note 16, 3m belgium received agreement with authorities in june 2022 to begin the process toward restarting operations at the zwijndrecht facility. 3m belgium has provided information required by the flemish environmental authorities to receive agreement from the authorities to restart operations, and has done so for production or sampling purposes. belgian government authorities continue to maintain oversight of these operations and compliance with applicable requirements. in december 2022, 3m belgium received an official infraction report from the flemish environmental inspectorate and continues to work with the government authorities to comply with applicable legal requirements. see further discussion in note 16.
3m is also impacted by the russia-ukraine conflict. in light of a number of factors, 3m suspended operations of its subsidiaries in russia in march 2022, the net sales of which were less than one percent of 3m's consolidated net sales for 2021. further, in september 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of the related net assets through an intended sale of the subsidiaries. the associated charge in 2022 related to this action is further discussed in note 15. 3m also has other operations that source certain raw materials from suppliers in russia and have experienced related supply disruption due to the conflict. further supply disruption could lead to downstream customer impacts.
though 3m monitors relevant factors as well as options to mitigate potential impacts, it is not able to predict the extent to which these circumstances may have a material effect on 3m's consolidated results of operations or financial condition. relevant risk factors can be found in item 1a "risk factors" in this annual report on form 10-k.

table of contents organic growth/productivity and other:
•remaining organic growth/productivity and other impacts resulted in a net year-on-year benefit $0.85 to earnings per share and 1.3 percent to operating margins which was impacted by the following:
◦benefits from strong pricing, spending discipline and 2021 restructuring actions
◦manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges; geopolitical impacts due to the russia/ukraine conflict as well as ongoing covid-related challenges in china
◦second quarter of 2021 benefit of $91 million pre-tax ($0.12 per share after tax) from the impact of the favorable decision of the brazilian supreme court regarding the calculation of past social taxes
◦increased investments in growth, productivity and sustainability
•in 2021, organic volume growth and ongoing cost management increased operating income margins and earnings per diluted share year-on-year offset by manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges and increased compensation/benefit costs. the following also impacted results or provide additional information:
•2021 benefit of $91 million pre-tax ($0.12 per share after tax) from a favorable brazilian supreme court decision that concluded on the impact of state value-added tax when determining brazil's federal sales-based social tax-essentially lowering the social tax that 3m should have paid in prior periods.
•3m continued prioritization of investments in growth and sustainability.
•2021 benefit from higher selling prices, restructuring actions taken in 2020 and positive/negative impact of year-over-year change in non-divestiture-related restructuring charges, net of adjustments, for respective periods. note 5 provides additional information relative to restructuring actions.
•in 2021, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost increased expense year-on-year.
•in 2022, 3m continued to experience inflationary pressures with year-on-year increases in raw material and logistics costs driven by many geopolitical, logistics, and disruptive events that caused imbalance in the global supply chain.
acquisitions/divestitures:
•divestiture impacts in 2022 include lost income from divested businesses and remaining stranded costs (net of transition arrangement income). 3m completed the split-off of the food safety business in september 2022 (discussed in note 3). the impact also includes lost income from deconsolidation of the aearo entities in july 2022 (discussed in note 16).
•divestiture impacts in 2021 are primarily comprised of the lost income from the divestiture of the company's drug delivery business (sale completed in may 2020).
•foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased operating income by approximately $271 million and $103 million (or a decrease in pre-tax earnings of approximately $280 million and $119 million) year-on-year for 2022 and 2021, respectively. these estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into u.s. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3m operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.
•interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2022 compared to the same period year-on-year driven by debt maturities in the ordinary course and interest income on invested cash.
•certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. overall, the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 9.6 percent, 17.8 percent, and 19.7 percent, respectively. these reflect a decrease of 8.2 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021. the primary factors that decreased the company's effective tax rate for 2022 were the tax efficient structure associated with the gain on split-off of the food safety business (see note 3). the primary factors that decreased the company's effective tax rate in 2021 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of u.s. international tax provisions.

financial statements
table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of hp inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of hp inc. and subsidiaries (the company) as of october 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders'
deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended october 31, 2022, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at october 31, 2022 and
2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended october
31, 2022, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of october 31, 2022, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) and our report dated december 6, 2022, except for the effect of the material weaknesses described in the fourth paragraph of that report, as to which the date is september 11, 2023, expressed an adverse opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
income taxes as described in notes 1 and 6 of the consolidated financial statements, the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and several other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of those jurisdictions.
uncertainty in the company's tax positions may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation and the company's positions are subject to examination by taxing authorities, which may result in assessments of additional amounts owed. determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related description of the matter                   effects requires significant management judgment in estimating whether a tax position's technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.
our assessment of management's analyses of the reserve for uncertain tax positions is significant to our audit because the amounts are material to the financial statements and the assessment process involves significant judgment. for example, management's interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings are challenging to audit.
we tested controls over management's processes relating to the recording of unrecognized tax benefits, including controls over the company's process to assess the technical merits of its uncertain tax positions, including the above described judgments.
our audit procedures included an evaluation of the company's key assumptions and judgments and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used to determine the amount of unrecognized how we addressed the matter in our audit    tax benefits recognized. for example, we evaluated the measurement of the amounts recorded taking into consideration the applicable tax laws and the company's positions examined by taxing authorities. we involved our tax professionals to assess the technical merits of the company's tax positions. this included assessing the company's correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the company.
revenue recognition as described in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the company enters into certain contracts to sell their products and services that contain non-standard terms and conditions and multiple performance obligations. for such contracts, significant interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of the transfer of control of promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations.
in addition, the company reduces revenue for customer and description of the matter                   distributor programs and incentive offerings including rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns.
the company uses significant estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on factors like historical experience, forecasted sales, expected customer behavior and market conditions.
our assessment of management's evaluation of the appropriate accounting for revenue contracts and the determination of the variable consideration for sales incentives are significant to our audit because the amounts are material to the financial statements and the assessment process involves significant judgment.
we tested relevant controls over the identified risks related to the company's accounting for revenue recognition, including the controls to evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment for contracts containing non-standard terms and conditions and multiple performance obligations and the controls related to the estimation process to record the variable consideration related to certain sales incentives.
our audit procedures included, among others, inspection of contracts entered into during the period, evaluation of management's judgments related to the interpretation of certain how we addressed the matter in our audit    contract provisions including the identification of performance obligations, the method of allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the arrangement, and the assessment of the appropriateness of the amount of revenue recognized.  we also evaluated the company's key assumptions and judgments and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used to determine the variable consideration for sales incentives. this included analyzing data related to the historical experience of sales incentive payments as well as understanding the current market dynamics that can affect the estimate of variable consideration to assess the company's judgments and estimates.

table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the stockholders and the board of directors of hp inc.
opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited hp inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of october 31, 2022, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, hp inc. and subsidiaries (the company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31, 2022, based on the coso criteria.
as indicated in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of poly, which is included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the company and constituted 1.3% of total assets as of october 31, 2022 and 0.5% of net revenues for the year then ended. our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of poly.
in our report dated december 6, 2022, we expressed an unqualified opinion that the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31, 2022, based on the coso criteria. management has subsequently identified design deficiencies involving revenue related to (i) recognition of revenue for a personal systems customer's transactions involving third-party financing and (ii) undue reliance on a payment application for certain sales incentive programs in emea, associated with variable consideration of approximately 4% of total consolidated revenues, for which management did not receive the system and organization controls type 1 (soc-1) report timely and did not have effective complementary user entity controls. as a result, management has revised its assessment, as presented in the accompanying management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting; to conclude that the company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of october 31, 2022. accordingly, our present opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of october 31, 2022, as expressed herein, is different from that expressed in our previous report.
a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. the following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management's assessment. management has identified material weaknesses in controls related to ineffective design of controls over revenue which include (i) recognition of revenue for a personal systems customer's transactions involving third-party financing and (ii) undue reliance on a payment application for certain sales incentive programs in emea, associated with variable consideration of approximately 4% of total consolidated revenues, for which management did not receive the system and organization controls type 1 (soc-1)
report timely and did not have effective complementary user entity controls. that existed as of october 31, 2022.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated balance sheets of hp inc. and subsidiaries as of october 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended october 31, 2022, and the related notes. the material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022
consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated december 6, 2022, except for notes 1, 2 and 19, as to which the date is september 11, 2023 which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
table of contents performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

table of contents management's report on internal control over financial reporting hp's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
hp's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. hp's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of hp; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of hp are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of hp; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of hp's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
hp's management assessed the effectiveness of hp's internal control over financial reporting as of october 31,
2022, utilizing the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission
(coso) in internal control-integrated framework (2013 framework).
in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. our management's evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of poly, which we acquired on august 29, 2022, as discussed in note 18,
"acquisitions". the exclusion represents internal control over financial reporting of 1.3 percent of total assets as of october 31, 2022 and less than 0.5 percent of net revenue for the then year ended. we have included the financial results of poly in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
we identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting due to design deficiencies involving
(i) recognition of revenue for a personal systems customer's transactions involving third-party financing and (ii)
undue reliance on a payment application for certain sales incentive programs in emea, associated with variable consideration of approximately 4% of total consolidated revenues, for which management did not receive the system and organization controls type 1 (soc-1) report timely and did not have effective complementary user entity controls.
the material weakness described in clause (i) resulted in an error related to a revenue contract in our personal systems segment that comprises less than 1% of total consolidated revenues for the impacted periods. as a result, we revised our prior period financial statements for this error and other previously identified errors, the impact of which was not material to our previously filed financial statements. the error was identified by management as part of the financial statement close process for the period ended july 31, 2023. the material weakness described in clause (ii) above did not result in any errors. while these material weaknesses did not result in a material misstatement of our previously filed financial statements, there is a reasonable possibility that these control deficiencies could have resulted in a material misstatement in the company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be detected. accordingly, we have determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses.
at the time that the form 10-k for our fiscal year ended october 31, 2022 was filed on december 6, 2022, management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of october 31, 2022. in the third quarter of the fiscal year ending october 31, 2023, management identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting that were determined to have existed as of october 31, 2022. as a result, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of october 31, 2022 and therefore has revised its report on internal control over financial reporting.
the effectiveness of hp's internal control over financial reporting as of october 31, 2022 has been audited by ernst & young llp, hp's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in part ii, item 8 of this amendment.

the accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
table of contents hp inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements note 1: summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements of hp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap.
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hp and its subsidiaries and affiliates in which hp has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
revision of prior period consolidated financial statements in connection with the preparation of hp's consolidated condensed financial statements for the three and nine months ended july 31, 2023, the company identified an accounting error related to a revenue contract in the personal systems segment. hp has revised its prior period financial statements to correct this error, as well as other immaterial errors, which impacted the last quarter and annual period of fiscal year 2020 and all the subsequent periods through the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. the company evaluated the error and determined that the related impacts were not material to its financial statements for the prior annual periods when they occurred, but that correcting the error would be material to the company's results of operations for the three and nine months ended july 31, 2023. the company has corrected these errors in the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods presented herein. revisions to the company's previously reported disclosures have been reflected in note 2, "segment information"; note 3, "restructuring and other charges"; note 4, "retirement and post-retirement benefit plans"; note 6, "taxes on earnings"; note 7, "supplementary financial information", note
12, "stockholders' deficit"; and note 13, "net earnings per share". a summary of the revisions to the company's previously reported financial statements is provided in note 19, "revision of prior period consolidated financial statements".
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in hp's consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
actual results may differ materially from those estimates. as of october 31, 2022, the extent to which the current macroeconomic factors will impact our business going forward depends on numerous dynamic factors which we cannot reliably predict. as a result, many of our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and may carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. as the events continue to evolve with respect to the pandemic and ongoing macroeconomic factors, our estimates may materially change in future periods.
foreign currency translation hp predominantly uses the u.s. dollar as its functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in non-u.s.
dollars are remeasured into u.s. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. net revenue, costs and expenses denominated in non-u.s. dollars are recorded in u.s. dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. hp includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. certain foreign subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and hp records the translation of their assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars at the balance sheet dates as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
oracle litigation proceeds on october 12, 2021, oracle paid approximately $ 4.65billion, to satisfy the judgement with interest, related to the litigation in connection with oracle's discontinuation of software support for former hewlett-packard company's itanium-based line of mission-critical servers. the net proceeds from the judgement were shared equally between hp and hewlett packard enterprise pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement between the parties. for the fiscal year 2021, hp recorded a gain of $ 2.3billion in interest and other, net and corresponding tax impact of $ 0.5billion in provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of earnings as oracle has exhausted legal appeals and has no further legal recourse to reverse the judgment.
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in october 2021, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued guidance on the recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination. this guidance requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers, as if the acquirer had originated the contracts.
under the new guidance, it is
table of contents hp inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
generally expected that an acquirer will recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with how they were recognized by the acquiree in its preacquisition financial statements. hp is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, with early adoption permitted hp has early adopted the guidance in fiscal year 2022, and the implementation of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in september 2022, the fasb issued guidance that enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs. under the new guidance, companies that use a supplier finance program in connection with the purchase of goods or services will be required to disclose information about the program to allow users of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. hp is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, except for the amendment on roll forward information which is effective one year later. early adoption is permitted. hp is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition general hp recognizes revenues at a point in time or over time depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which hp expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. hp follows the five-step model for revenue recognition as summarized below:
1 . identify the contract with a customer - a contract with customer exists when (i) it is approved and signed by all parties,
(ii) each party's rights and obligations can be identified, (iii) payment terms are defined, (iv) it has commercial substance and (v) the customer has the ability and intent to pay. hp evaluates customers' ability to pay based on various factors like historical payment experience, financial metrics and customer credit scores. while the majority of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions, there are certain contracts with non-
standard terms and conditions.
2. identify the performance obligations in the contract - hp evaluates each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it is distinct, such as hardware and/or service. a performance obligation constitutes distinct goods or services when the customer can benefit from such goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract.
3. determine the transaction price - transaction price is the amount of consideration to which hp expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. if the transaction price includes a variable amount, hp estimates the amount it expects to be entitled to using either the expected value or the most likely amount method.
hp reduces the transaction price at the time of revenue recognition for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. hp uses estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on factors like historical experience, expected consumer behavior and market conditions.
hp has elected the practical expedient of not accounting for significant financing components if the period between revenue recognition and when the customer pays for the product or service is one year or less.
4. allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract - when a sales arrangement contains multiple performance obligations, such as hardware and/or services, hp allocates revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to their selling price. the selling price for each performance obligation is based on its standalone selling price ("ssp"). hp establishes ssp using the price charged for a performance obligation when sold separately
("observable price") and, in some instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. when observable price is not available, hp establishes ssp based on management judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles.
5. recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied - revenue is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. hp generally invoices the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms. for fixed price support or maintenance contracts that are in the nature of stand-ready obligations, payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contract.
table of contents hp inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
hp reports revenue net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, and the collected taxes are recorded as other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. hp includes costs related to shipping and handling in cost of revenue.
hp records revenue on a gross basis when hp is a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when hp is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor. hp considers several factors to determine whether it is acting as a principal or an agent, most notably whether hp is the primary obligor to the customer, has established its own pricing and has inventory and credit risks.
hardware hp transfers control of the products to the customer at the time the product is delivered to the customer and recognizes revenue accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations to the customer remain unfulfilled. hp records revenue from the sale of equipment under sales-type leases as revenue at the commencement of the lease.
services hp recognizes revenue from fixed-price support, maintenance and other service contracts over time depicting the pattern of service delivery and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred.
contract assets and liabilities contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that hp has transferred to a customer when such right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. such contract assets are not material to hp's consolidated financial statements.
contract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenues when amounts invoiced to customers are more than the revenues recognized or when payments are received in advance for fixed-price support or maintenance contracts. the short-term and long-term deferred revenues are reported within the other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities respectively.
cost to obtain a contract and fulfillment cost incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract primarily consist of sales commissions. hp has elected the practical expedient to expense as incurred the costs to obtain a contract with a benefit period equal to or less than one year. for contracts with a period of benefit greater than one year, hp capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and amortizes these costs over their expected period of benefit provided such costs are recoverable.
fulfillment costs consist of set-up and transition costs related to other service contracts. these costs generate or enhance resources of hp that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future and are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of the benefit, provided such costs are recoverable.
see note 7, "supplementary financial information" for details on net revenue by region, cost to obtain a contract and fulfillment cost, contract liabilities and value of remaining performance obligations.
leases at the inception of a contract, hp assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. the assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether hp obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether hp has the right to direct the use of the asset.
all significant lease arrangements are recognized at lease commencement. leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the consolidated statement of earnings. hp determines the lease term by assuming the exercise of renewal options that are reasonably certain. as most of the leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, hp uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate at the commencement date to determine the present value of future payments that are reasonably certain.
stock-based compensation hp determines stock-based compensation expense based on the measurement date fair value of the award. hp recognizes compensation cost only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. hp determines compensation costs at the aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance and/or market conditions. hp estimates the forfeiture rate based on its historical experience.
table of contents hp inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
retirement and post-retirement plans hp has various defined benefit, other contributory and non-contributory retirement and post-retirement plans. hp generally amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the average remaining estimated service life of participants. in limited cases, hp amortizes actuarial gains and losses using the corridor approach. see note 4, "retirement and post-retirement benefit plans" for a full description of these plans and the accounting and funding policies.
advertising cost costs to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. costs to communicate advertising are expensed when the advertising is first run.such costs totaled approximately $ 696million, $ 829million and $
restructuring and other charges hp records charges associated with management-approved restructuring plans to reorganize one or more of hp's business segments, to remove duplicative headcount and infrastructure associated with business acquisitions or to simplify business processes and accelerate innovation. restructuring charges can include severance costs to reduce a specified number of employees, enhanced early retirement incentives, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. hp records restructuring charges based on estimated employee terminations, committed early retirements and site closure and consolidation plans. hp accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. the rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. other charges include non-recurring costs, including those as a result of information technology rationalization efforts and proxy contest activities, and are distinct from ongoing operational costs.
taxes on earnings hp recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. hp records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
hp records accruals for uncertain tax positions when hp believes that it is not more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position.
hp makes adjustments to these accruals when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. the provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions, as well as any related interest and penalties.
accounts receivable hp records allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses inherent in the asset over its expected life. the allowance for credit losses is maintained based on the relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.
hp records a specific reserve for individual accounts when hp becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. if there are additional changes in circumstances related to the specific customer, hp further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. hp assesses collectability by pooling receivables where similar risk characteristics exist.
hp maintains an allowance for credit losses for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, financial condition of customers, length of time receivables are past due, trends in the weighted-average risk rating for the portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, information derived from competitive benchmarking, significant one-time events, and historical experience. the past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable.
hp utilizes certain third-party arrangements in the normal course of business as part of hps cash and liquidity management and also to provide liquidity to certain partners to facilitate their working capital requirements.
these financing arrangements, which in certain cases provide for partial recourse, result in the transfer of hp's trade receivables to a third-party. hp reflects amounts transferred to, but not yet collected from the third-party in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets. for arrangements involving an element of recourse, the fair value of the recourse obligation is measured using market data from similar transactions and reported as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets.
table of contents hp inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
concentrations of risk financial instruments that potentially subject hp to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments, receivables from trade customers and contract manufacturers and derivatives.
hp maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. these financial institutions are located in many different geographic regions, and hp's policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. as part of its risk management processes, hp performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. hp has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. hp utilizes derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency, interest rate and, on certain investment exposures.
such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result in a material loss. the likelihood of which hp deems to be remote.
hp sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant receivable balances with these parties. if the financial condition or operations of these distributors' and resellers' aggregated business deteriorates substantially, hp's operating results could be adversely affected. the ten largest distributor and reseller receivable balances, which were concentrated primarily in north america and europe, collectively represented approximately 52% and 42% of gross accounts receivable as of october 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. two customers td synnex corp and ingram micro inc., accounted for 13.8% and 10.4%, respectively, of gross accounts receivable as of october 31, 2022. no single customer accounted for more than 10% of gross accounts receivable as of october 31, 2021. credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable is generally diversified due to hp's large customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic markets. hp performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its third-party distributors, resellers and other customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances.
hp utilizes outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture hp-designed products. hp may purchase product components from suppliers and sell those components to its outsourced manufacturers thereby creating receivable balances from the outsourced manufacturers. the three largest outsourced manufacturer receivable balances collectively represented 89% and 85% of hp's supplier receivables of $ 0.3billion and $ 1.4billion as of october
31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. hp includes the supplier receivables in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. hp's credit risk associated with these receivables is mitigated wholly or in part, by the amount hp owes to these outsourced manufacturers, as hp generally has the legal right to offset its payables to the outsourced manufacturers against these receivables. hp does not reflect the sale of these components in net revenue and does not recognize any profit on these component sales until the related products are sold by hp, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction to cost of revenue.
hp obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers like canon, due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. the loss of a single source supplier, the deterioration of hp's relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which hp is supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect hp's net revenue, cash flows and gross margins.
inventory hp values inventory at the lower of cost or market. cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. adjustments, if required, to reduce the cost of inventory to market (net realizable value) are made for estimated excess, obsolete or impaired balances after considering judgments related to future demand and market conditions.
property, plant and equipment, net hp reflects property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. hp capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred. depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. estimated useful lives are fiveto 40years for buildings and improvements and threeto 15years for machinery and equipment. hp depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. hp depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. on retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheets with any gain or loss recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings.
internal use software and cloud computing arrangements hp capitalizes external costs and directly attributable internal costs to acquire or create internal use software which are incurred subsequent to the completion of the preliminary project stage. these costs relate to activities such as software design, configuration, coding, testing, and installation. costs related to post-implementation activities such as training and maintenance
table of contents hp inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
are expensed as incurred. once the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, capitalized development costs are amortized straight-line over the estimated useful life of the software, generally not to exceed five years.
hp also enters into certain cloud-based software hosting arrangements that are accounted for as service contracts.
for internal-use software obtained through a hosting arrangement that is in the nature of a service contract, hp incurs certain implementation costs such as integrating, configuring, and software customization, which are consistent with costs incurred during the application development stage for on-premise software. hp applies the same guidance to determine costs that are eligible for capitalization. for these arrangements, hp amortizes the capitalized development costs straight-line over the fixed, non-cancellable term of the associated hosting arrangement plus any reasonably certain renewal periods. hp also applies the same impairment model to both internal-use software and capitalized implementation costs in a software hosting arrangement that is in the nature of a service contract.
business combinations hp includes the results of operations of the acquired business in hp's consolidated results prospectively from the acquisition date. hp allocates the purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-
controlling interests in the acquired entity generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. the primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and hp, and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify for recognition as an intangible asset. acquisition and divestiture charges are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. these charges primarily include, direct third-party professional and legal fees, integration and divestiture-related costs, as well as non-cash adjustments to the fair value adjustments of certain acquired assets such as inventory and certain compensation charges related to cash settlement of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units of acquired companies .
goodwill hp reviews goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. hp can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment or hp can directly perform the quantitative impairment test. based on the qualitative assessment, if hp determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be performed.
in the quantitative impairment test, hp compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach.
under the income approach, hp estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. hp bases cash flow projections on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. hp bases the discount rate on the weighted-
average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. under the market approach, hp estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. hp weights the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. when market comparables are not meaningful or not available, hp estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach.
in order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of hp's reporting units, hp compares the aggregate reporting unit fair value to hp's market capitalization on an overall basis and calculates an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units' fair value over hp's market capitalization on an overall basis). hp evaluates the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions. if the implied control premium is determined to not be reasonable in light of these recent transactions, hp re-evaluates its reporting unit fair values, which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate and/or other assumptions. this re-evaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all reporting units.
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over the fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.
debt and marketable equity securities investments hp determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the classifications at each balance sheet date. debt and marketable equity securities are generally considered available-for-sale. all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. marketable debt
table of contents hp inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
securities with maturities of twelve months or less are classified as short-term investments and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than twelve months are classified based on their availability for use in current operations. marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either short or long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations.
available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive loss. unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, credit losses and impairments on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in consolidated statements of earnings. realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are calculated at the individual security level and included in interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.
hp monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment and credit losses on a quarterly basis. if hp intends to sell a debt security or it is more likely than not that hp will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in interest and other, net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
in other cases, if the carrying amount of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be due to credit related reasons, hp records a credit loss allowance, limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. hp recognizes the corresponding charge in interest and other, net and the remaining unrealized loss, if any, in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. factors that hp considers while determining the credit loss allowance includes, but is not limited to, severity and the reason for the decline in value, interest rate changes and counterparty long-term ratings.
derivatives hp uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps, total return swaps, treasury rate locks, forward starting swaps and, at times, option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, return on certain investment exposures. hp also may use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such as forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. hp does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. see note 10, "financial instruments" for a full description of hp's derivative instrument activities and related accounting policies.

(2) includes reclassification of liability related to the enhanced early retirement ("eer") plan of $ 44million for certain healthcare and medical savings account benefits to pension and post retirement plans. see note 4
"retirement and post-retirement benefit plans" for further information .
fiscal 2023 plan on november 18, 2022, hp's board of directors approved the fiscal 2023 plan intended to enable digital transformation, portfolio optimization and operational efficiency that hp expects will be implemented through fiscal 2025. hp expects to reduce global headcount by approximately 4,000to 6,000employees. hp estimates that it will incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 1.0billion relating to labor and non-labor actions. hp expects to incur approximately $ 0.7billion primarily in labor costs related to workforce reductions and the remaining costs will relate to non-labor actions and other charges.

note 4: retirement and post-retirement benefit plans defined benefit plans hp sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans worldwide. the most significant defined benefit plan, the hp inc. pension plan ("pension plan") is a frozen plan in the united states.
hp reduces the benefit payable to certain u.s. employees under the pension plan for service before 1993, if any, by any amounts due to the employee under hp's frozen defined contribution deferred profit-sharing plan ("dpsp"). at october 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of plan assets of the dpsp was $ 366million and $ 482million, respectively. the dpsp obligations are equal to the plan assets and are recognized as an offset to the pension plan when hp calculates its defined benefit pension cost and obligations.
in august 2021, hp entered into an agreement with the prudential insurance company of america ("prudential") to purchase an irrevocable group annuity contract and transfer approximately $ 5.2billion of the pension plan obligations. under the agreement, prudential assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately 41,000retirees and beneficiaries, with no changes to the amount or timing of monthly retirement benefit payments. this transaction closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 and was funded by the assets of the pension plan. hp recorded a settlement gain of approximately $ 39million in interest and other, net on the consolidated statements of earnings, with no cash flow impact.
post-retirement benefit plans hp sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, of which the most significant are in the united states. under the hp inc. retiree welfare benefits plan, certain pre-2003 retirees and grandfathered participants with continuous service to hp since 2002 are eligible to receive partially subsidized medical coverage based on years of service at retirement. hp's share of the premium cost is capped for all subsidized medical coverage provided under the hp inc.
retiree welfare benefits plan. hp currently leverages the employer group waiver plan process to provide hp inc.
retiree welfare benefits plan post-65 prescription drug coverage under medicare part d, thereby giving hp access to federal subsidies to help pay for retiree benefits.
certain employees not grandfathered for partially subsidized medical coverage under the above programs, and employees hired after 2002 but before august 2008, are eligible for credits under the hp inc. retiree welfare benefits plan. credits offered after september 2008 are provided in the form of matching credits on employee contributions made to a voluntary employee beneficiary association upon attaining age 45or as part of early retirement programs. on retirement, former employees may use these credits for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses, including premiums required for coverage.
defined contribution plans hp offers various defined contribution plans for u.s. and non-u.s. employees. total defined contribution expense was $ 119million in fiscal year 2022, $ 112million in fiscal year 2021 and $ 108million in fiscal year 2020.
u.s. employees are automatically enrolled in the hp inc. 401(k) plan when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. the employer matching contributions in the hp inc. 401(k) plan is 100% of the first 4% of eligible compensation contributed by employees, and the employer match is vested after three yearsof employee service. generally, an employee must be employed by hp inc. on the last day of the calendar year to receive a match.

the cumulative net actuarial losses for our defined pension plans and retiree welfare plans decreased year over year. the decrease in losses is primarily due to significant increases in discount rates and lump sum interest rates, partially offset by lower than expected returns on assets, plan experience, and other assumption changes.

(7) these investments include alternative investments, which primarily consist of private equities and hedge funds.
the valuation of alternative investments, such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment. for alternative investments, valuation is based on nav as reported by the asset manager or investment company and adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. in making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by management, including but not limited to the timeliness of nav as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last nav reported by the asset manager.
• private equities include limited partnerships such as equity, buyout, venture capital, real estate and other similar funds that invest in the united states and internationally where foreign currencies are hedged.
• hedge funds include limited partnerships that invest both long and short primarily in common stocks and credit, relative value, event-driven equity, distressed debt and macro strategies. management of the hedge funds has the ability to shift investments from value to growth strategies, from small to large capitalization stocks and bonds, and from a net long position to a net short position.
these investments also include common collective trusts and 103-12 investment entities as defined in note (3) above and investment funds as defined in note (4) above.

investment policy hp's investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. the majority of the plans'
investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest. risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. a number of the plans' investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and hp may utilize derivatives to affect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability exposures.
the target asset allocation selected for each u.s. plan (pension and post-retirement) reflects a risk/return profile hp believes is appropriate relative to each plan's liability structure and return goals. hp conducts periodic asset-liability studies for u.s. plans to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plan's forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs and to develop a policy glide path which adjusts the asset allocation with funded status. due to the strong funded status for the u.s. pension plan, consistent with our policy, steps have been taken to de-risk the portfolio by reallocation of assets to liability hedging fixed-income investments. hp also invests a portion of the u.s. defined benefit plan assets in private market securities such as private equity funds to provide diversification and a higher expected return on assets.
outside the united states, asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. as in the united states, investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. in some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed-income securities than would otherwise be deployed.
hp reviews the investment strategy and where appropriate, can offer some assistance in the selection of investment managers, with final decisions on asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees for the specific plan.
basis for expected long-term rate of return on plan assets the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns which considers each country's specific inflation outlook. because hp's investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns are adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns net of fees.
retirement incentive program as part of the fiscal 2020 plan, hp announced the voluntary eer program for its u.s. employees in october 2019.
voluntary participation in the eer program was limited to those employees who were at least 50years old with 20 or more years of service at hp. employees accepted into the eer program left hp on dates ranging from december 31,
2019 to september 30, 2020. the eer benefit was a cash lump sum payment which was calculated based on years of service at hp at the time of the retirement and ranging from 13 to 52 weeks of pay.
all employees participating in the eer program were offered the opportunity to continue health care coverage at the active employee contribution rates for up to 36months following retirement. in addition, hp provided up to $
12,000in employer credits under the retirement medical savings account ("rmsa") program. in relation to the continued health care

lump sum program hp offered a lump sum program during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. certain terminated vested participants in the hp inc. pension plan ("pension plan") could elect to take a one-time voluntary lump sum payment equal to the present value of future benefits. approximately 12,000participants elected the lump sum option. payments of $
2.2billion were made from plan assets to the participants in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. a non-cash settlement expense of $ 214million arising from the accelerated recognition of previously deferred actuarial losses was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020.
future contributions and funding policy in fiscal year 2023, hp expects to contribute approximately $ 36million to its non-u.s. pension plans, $ 32million to cover benefit payments to u.s. non-qualified plan participants and $ 4million to cover benefit claims for hp's post-retirement benefit plans. hp's policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities.
estimated future benefits payments as of october 31, 2022, hp estimates that the future benefits payments for the retirement and post-retirement plans are as follows:

stock-based incentive compensation plans hp's stock-based incentive compensation plan includes equity plan adopted in 2004, as amended and restated
("principal equity plan"). stock-based awards granted under the equity plan includes restricted stock awards, stock options and performance-based awards. employees meeting certain employment qualifications are eligible to receive stock-based awards. the aggregate number of shares of hp's stock authorized for issuance under the principal equity plan is 626.0million.
restricted stock awards are non-vested stock awards that may include grants of restricted stock or restricted stock units. restricted stock awards and cash-settled awards are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. such awards generally vest oneto three yearsfrom the date of grant. during the vesting period, ownership of the restricted stock cannot be transferred. restricted stock has the same dividend and voting rights as common stock and is considered to be issued and outstanding upon grant. the dividends paid on restricted stock are non-forfeitable. restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. however, shares underlying restricted stock units are included in the calculation of diluted net eps. restricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. hp expenses the fair value of restricted stock awards ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse. the majority of restricted stock units issued by hp contain only service vesting conditions. hp also grants performance-adjusted restricted stock units which vest only on the satisfaction of both service and the achievement of certain performance goals including market conditions prior to the expiration of the awards.
stock options granted under the principal equity plan are generally non-qualified stock options, but the principal equity plan permits some options granted to qualify as incentive stock options under the u.s. internal revenue code. stock options generally vest over threeto four yearsfrom the date of grant. the exercise price of a stock option is equal to the closing price of hp's stock on the option grant date. the majority of stock options issued by hp contain only service vesting conditions. hp grants performance-contingent stock options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions prior to the expiration of the awards.
rsu and stock option grants provide for accelerated vesting in certain circumstances as defined in the plans and related grant agreements, including termination in connection with a change in control.
restricted stock units hp uses the closing stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of service-based restricted stock units. hp estimates the fair value of restricted stock units subject to performance-adjusted vesting conditions using a combination of the
table of contents hp inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
closing stock price on the grant date and a monte carlo simulation model. the assumptions used to measure the fair value of restricted stock units subject to performance-adjusted vesting conditions in the monte carlo simulation model were as follows:

stock options hp utilizes the black-scholes-merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options subject to service-based vesting conditions. hp estimates the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a monte carlo simulation model and a lattice model as these awards contain market conditions. the weighted-average fair value and the assumptions used to measure fair value were as follows:

(1) the weighted-average fair value was based on stock options granted during the period.
(2) expected volatility was estimated based on a blended volatility ( 50% historical volatility and 50% implied volatility from traded options on hp's common stock).
(4) the expected dividend yield represents a constant dividend yield applied for the duration of the expected term of the award.
(5) for awards subject to service-based vesting, the expected term was estimated using a simplified method; and for performance-contingent awards, the expected term represents an output from the lattice model.
a summary of stock options activity is as follows:
the aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that option holders would have realized had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of fiscal years 2022,
2021 and 2020. the aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between hp's closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. the total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 25million, $ 18million and $

employee stock purchase plan hp sponsors the 2021 espp, pursuant to which eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of base compensation, subject to certain income limits, to purchase shares of hp's common stock.
pursuant to the terms of the 2021 espp, employees purchase stock under the 2021 espp at a price equal to 95% of hp's closing stock price on the purchase date. nostock-based compensation expense was recorded in connection with those purchases because the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met. the aggregate number of shares of hp's stock authorized for issuance under the 2021 espp was 50million. the 2021 espp came into effect on may 1, 2021 upon expiry of the 2011 espp. the 2021 espp terms are similar to the previous espp.

as of october 31, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 1.0billion, of which up to $ 783million would affect hp's effective tax rate if realized. total gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 216million for the twelve months ended october 31, 2022. hp recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings. as of october 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, hp had accrued $ 64million, $ 70million and $
34million, respectively, for interest and penalties.
hp engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. hp expects complete resolution of certain tax years with various tax authorities within the next
12months. hp believes it is reasonably possible that its existing gross unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by up to $ 38million within the next 12 months, affecting hp's effective tax rate if realized.
hp is subject to income tax in the united states and approximately 60other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. in addition, hp is subject to numerous ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. the irs is conducting an audit of hp's 2018 and 2019 income tax returns.
with respect to major state and foreign tax jurisdictions, hp is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 2002. no material tax deficiencies have been assessed in major state or foreign tax jurisdictions related to ongoing audits as of october 31, 2022.
table of contents hp inc. and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements (continued)
hp believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits. hp regularly assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of hp's tax provision. hp adjusts its uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. however, income tax audits are inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that hp will accurately predict the outcome of these audits. the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in the provision for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could have a material impact on net income or cash flows.
hp has not provided for u.s. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $ 5.1billion of undistributed earnings from non-u.s. operations as of october 31, 2022 because hp intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the united states. determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.

7.6billion, $ 7.7billion and $ 8.0billion, respectively. in fiscal year 2022, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance decreased by $ 157million primarily due to foreign net operating losses, u.s. deferred tax assets that are anticipated to be realized at a lower effective rate than the federal statutory tax rate, and the impact of the acquisition of poly on the company's deferred tax assets. in fiscal year 2021, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance decreased by $ 202million primarily due to foreign net operating losses and u.s. deferred tax assets that are anticipated to be realized at a lower effective rate due to certain future u.s. international tax reform implications. in fiscal year 2020, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased by $ 21million primarily associated with foreign net operating losses and u.s. deferred tax assets that are anticipated to be realized at a lower effective rate than the federal statutory tax rate due to certain future u.s. international tax reform implications.

hp utilizes certain third-party arrangements in the normal course of business as part of hps cash and liquidity management and also to provide liquidity to certain partners to facilitate their working capital requirements.
these financing arrangements, which in certain circumstances may contain partial recourse, result in a transfer of hp's receivables and risk to the third-party. as these transfers qualify as true sales under the applicable accounting guidance, the receivables are derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets upon transfer, and hp receives a payment for the receivables from the third-party within a mutually agreed upon time period. for arrangements involving an element of recourse, the recourse obligation is measured using market data from the similar transactions and reported as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets. the recourse obligations as of october 31, 2022 and 2021, and the costs associated with the sales of trade receivables for fiscal year 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not material.

• the revenue from the performance obligation is recognized over time on an as-invoiced basis when the amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer; or
• the portion of the transaction price that is variable in nature is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.
the remaining performance obligations are subject to change and may be affected by various factors, such as termination of contracts, contract modifications and adjustment for currency.

note 9: fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
fair value hierarchy hp uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions market participants would use. assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:
level 1-quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2-quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.
level 3-unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs.

valuation techniques cash equivalents and investments: hp holds time deposits, money market funds, mutual funds, other debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds, and common stock and equivalents. hp values cash equivalents and equity investments using quoted market prices, alternative pricing sources, including net asset value, or models utilizing market observable inputs. the fair value of debt investments is based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using inputs primarily derived from or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable market data.
derivative instruments: hp uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, hp and counterparty credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and interest rates. see note 10, "financial instruments" for a further discussion of hp's use of derivative instruments.
other fair value disclosures short- and long-term debt: hp estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an expected present value technique, which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities and considering its own credit risk. the portion of hp's debt that is hedged is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as an amount equal to the debt's carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. the fair value of hp's short- and long-term debt was $
9.6billion as compared to its carrying amount of $ 11.0billion at october 31, 2022. the fair value of hp's short-
and long-term debt was $ 8.0billion as compared to its carrying value of $ 7.5billion at october 31, 2021. if measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, short- and long-term debt would be classified in level 2
of the fair value hierarchy.

note 9: fair value (continued)
other financial instruments: for the balance of hp's financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. if measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, these other financial instruments would be classified as level 2 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
non-marketable equity investments and non-financial assets: hp's non-marketable equity investments are measured at cost less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes. hp's non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value in the period an impairment charge is recognized. if measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets these would generally be classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. as of october 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. interest income related to cash, cash equivalents and debt securities was approximately $ 46million in fiscal year 2022, $ 31million in fiscal year 2021, and $ 40million in fiscal year 2020. the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investments may not be representative of values that will be realized in the future.
contractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale debt securities were as follows:
amortized       fair value cost in millions due in one year    $                 17    $          17
non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies are included in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. these amounted to $ 110million and $ 59million as of october 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
hp determines credit losses on cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level. all instruments are considered investment grade. no credit-related or noncredit-related impairment losses were recorded in the fiscal year 2022.
derivative instruments hp uses derivatives to offset business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows and on certain existing assets and liabilities. as part of its risk management strategy, hp uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps, total return swaps, treasury rate locks, forward starting swaps and, at times, option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, return on certain investment exposures. hp may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges and classifies the cash flows with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items. additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, hp categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. hp recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets.
as a result of its use of derivative instruments, hp is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. master netting agreements mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting hp to net amounts due from hp to counterparty against amounts due to hp from the same counterparty under certain conditions. to further limit

note 10: financial instruments (continued)
credit risk, hp has collateral security agreements that allow hp's custodian to hold collateral from, or require hp to post collateral to, counterparties when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit ratings of hp and its counterparties. if hp's or the counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, either party has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. the company includes gross collateral posted and received in other current assets and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, respectively.
the fair value of derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $ 82million and $
64million as of october 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, all of which were fully collateralized within twobusiness days.
under hp's derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting hp that results in the surviving entity being rated below a specified credit rating.
this credit contingent provision did not affect hp's financial position or cash flows as of october 31, 2022 and
fair value hedges hp enters into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in benchmark interest rates on hp's future interest payments.
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, hp recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings in the period of change.
cash flow hedges hp uses forward contracts, treasury rate locks, forward starting swaps and, at times, option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and debt issuance. hp's foreign currency cash flow hedges mature predominantly within twelve months; however, hedges related to long-term procurement arrangements extend several years.
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, hp initially records changes in fair value of the derivative instrument in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders' deficit in the consolidated balance sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. hp reports the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in the same financial statement line item as changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
during the fiscal year 2022, a series of forward starting swaps, which were executed with a total notional amount of $ 1.75billion along with already existing forward starting swaps with a total notional amount of $ 1.5billion, were settled upon the issuance of the senior unsecured notes, resulting in a gain of $ 79million recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). the gain will be reclassified to interest and other, net, in the consolidated statements of earnings over a portion of the life of the related debt.
other derivatives other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. hp also uses total return swaps to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan liability.
for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, hp recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in interest and other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings in the period of change.
hedge effectiveness for interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, hp measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item with the change in fair value of the derivative. for foreign currency options, forward contracts and forward starting swaps designated as cash flow hedges, hp measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates.
during fiscal 2022 and 2021, no portion of the hedging instruments' gain or loss was excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for fair value and cash flow hedges.

(1) represents the cash collateral posted by counterparties as of the respective reporting date for hp's asset position, net of derivative amounts that could be offset, as of, generally, twobusiness days prior to the respective reporting date.

note 14: litigation and contingencies hp is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of ip, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. hp accrues a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. hp believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of october 31, 2022, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in hp's financial statements. hp reviews these matters at least quarterly and adjusts its accruals to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement entered into with hewlett packard enterprise, hp shares responsibility with hewlett packard enterprise for certain matters, as indicated below, and hewlett packard enterprise has agreed to indemnify hp in whole or in part with respect to certain matters. based on its experience, hp believes that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters discussed below are not a meaningful indicator of hp's potential liability.
litigation is inherently unpredictable. however, hp believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies.
litigation, proceedings and investigations copyright levies . proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving hp in certain european countries, challenging the imposition or the modification of levies regimes upon it equipment (such as pcs or printers) or the restrictions to exonerate the application of private copying levies on devices purchased by business users. the levies are generally based upon the number of products sold and the per-product amounts of the levies, which vary.
some european countries are expected to implement legislation to introduce or extend existing levy schemes to digital devices. hp, other companies and various industry associations have opposed the extension of levies to the digital environment and certain requirements for business sales exemptions, and have advocated alternative models of compensation to rights holders.
based on industry opposition to the extension of levies to digital products, hp's assessments of the merits of various proceedings and hp's estimates of the number of units impacted and the amounts of the levies, hp has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the ongoing disputes.
forsyth, et al. v. hp inc. and hewlett packard enterprise . this is a purported class and collective action filed on august 18, 2016 in the united states district court, northern district of california, against hp and hewlett packard enterprise ("hpe") alleging the defendants violated federal and state law by terminating older workers and replacing them with younger workers. in their most recent complaint, plaintiffs seek to represent (1) a putative nationwide federal age discrimination in employment act (adea) collective comprised of all former hp inc. employees
40years of age and older who had their employment terminated under a wfr plan in or after 2014 or 2015, depending on state law; and (2) a putative rule 23 class under california law comprised of all former hp inc. employees
40years of age and older who had their employment terminated in california under a wfr plan in or after 2012.
excluded from the putative collective and class are employees who (a) signed a waiver and general release agreement at termination, or (b) signed an agreement to arbitrate claims. similar claims are pending against hpe. because the court granted plaintiffs' motion for preliminary certification of the putative nationwide adea collectives, a third-party administrator notified eligible former employees of their right to opt into the adea collective. this opt-in period closed on february 15, 2022. plaintiffs seek monetary damages, punitive damages, and other relief.

note 14: litigation and contingencies (continued)
million in damages, among other things, for alleged misstatements regarding lynch. trial was completed in january
2020. on may 17, 2022, the court issued its final judgment, memorializing its findings that hp succeeded in substantially all of its claims and that messrs. lynch and hussein engaged in fraud, and dismissing mr. lynch's counterclaim. the court deferred its assessment of damages to a later, separate judgment to be issued after further submissions, but it has indicated that damages awarded may be substantially less than is claimed. litigation is unpredictable, and there can be no assurance that hp will recover damages or as to how any award of damages will compare with the amount claimed. the amount ultimately awarded, if any, would be recorded in the period received.
no adjustment has been recorded in the financial statements in relation to this potential award. pursuant to the terms of the separation and distribution agreement, hp and hewlett packard enterprise will share equally in any recovery.
environmental hp is, and may become a party to, proceedings brought by u.s. or state agencies or private third parties under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act ("cercla"), known as "superfund," or state laws similar to cercla. hp is also conducting environmental investigations or remediation at several current or former operating sites and former disposal sites pursuant to administrative orders or consent agreements with environmental agencies.
note 15: guarantees, indemnifications and warranties guarantees in the ordinary course of business, hp may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, customers and other parties pursuant to which hp has guaranteed the performance obligations of third parties. some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. in general, hp would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee. hp believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material guarantee is remote.
cross-indemnifications with hewlett packard enterprise on november 1, 2015, hewlett-packard company completed the separation of hewlett packard enterprise, hewlett-
packard company's former enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses. the separation and distribution agreement provides for cross-indemnities between hp and hewlett packard enterprise for liabilities allocated to the respective party pursuant to the terms of such agreement. for information on cross-
indemnifications with hewlett packard enterprise for litigation matters, see note 14, "litigation and contingencies".
indemnifications in the ordinary course of business, hp enters into contractual arrangements under which hp may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of hp or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. hp also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the vendors' and customers' use of hp's software products and services and certain other matters. some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.
hp records tax indemnification receivables from various third parties for certain tax liabilities that hp is jointly and severally liable for, but for which it is indemnified by those same third parties under existing legal agreements. hp records a tax indemnification payable to various third parties under these agreements when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. the actual amount that the third parties pay or may be obligated to pay hp could vary depending on the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years.
warranties hp accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. hp engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failures outside of hp's baseline experience, affect the estimated warranty obligation.

note 16: commitments unconditional purchase obligations as of october 31, 2022, hp had unconditional purchase obligations of $ 3.3billion. these unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on hp and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. these unconditional purchase obligations are primarily related to inventory and service support. unconditional purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty.
as of october 31, 2022, unconditional purchase obligations were as follows:

note 17: leases hp determines, at lease inception, whether or not an arrangement contains a lease. a significant portion of the operating lease portfolio includes real estate leases. additionally, hp has identified embedded operating leases within certain outsourced supply chain contracts. leasing arrangements typically range in terms from 1to 11years with varying renewal and termination options. substantially all of hp's leases are considered operating leases.
finance leases, short-term leases and sub-lease income were not material as of october 31, 2022 and 2021 or for the fiscal years ended october 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that hp will exercise such options. hp generally considers the economic life of the rou assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. hp's leases generally do not provide a residual guarantee.
operating leases are included in other non-current assets, other current liabilitiesand other non-current liabilities. finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net, notes payable and short-term borrowings and long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.
as most of the leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, hp uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date of a lease in determining the present value of lease payments. the incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the rate of interest that hp would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. hp uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate.
hp has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components as a single lease element for its real estate leases and certain outsourced supply chain contracts in calculating the rou assets and lease liabilities. where hp chooses not to combine the lease and non-lease components, hp allocates contract consideration to the lease and non-lease components based on relative standalone prices.
hp reviews the impairment of the rou assets consistent with the approach applied for other long-lived assets.

all lease expenses, including variable lease costs, are primarily included in cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the use of the facilities.
variable lease expense relates primarily to leased real estate utilized for office space and outsourced warehousing. these costs primarily include adjustments for inflation, payments dependent on a rate or index or usage of asset and common area maintenance charges. these costs are not included in the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred.
the following table presents supplemental information relating to the cash flows arising from lease transactions.
cash 'payments made from variable lease costs and short-term leases are not included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities, and, as such, are excluded from the amounts below:

note 18: acquisitions acquisitions in fiscal 2022
in fiscal 2022, hp completed twoacquisitions. hp estimated the preliminary fair values of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and the excess of the consideration transferred over the aggregate of such fair values was recorded as goodwill. the preliminary fair values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired were based on preliminary valuations performed by third-party valuation specialists, and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). the primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of intangible assets acquired, certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes and residual goodwill. we expect to continue to obtain information to assist us in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired during the measurement period.
pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to hp's consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, is not deductible for tax purposes.
the following table presents the aggregate estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including those items that are still preliminary allocations, for the acquisitions in fiscal 2022:
amortizable intangible assets                 1,429

acquisition of poly in fiscal 2022, hp completed the acquisition of poly, a leading global provider of workplace collaboration solutions at a total enterprise value of $ 3.3billion, inclusive of the exchange offer. the purchase consideration of $ 2.8billion included payment to shareholders in an all-cash transaction for $ 40per share, amounting to $
1.8billion and repayment of poly's existing term loan of $ 1.0billion. poly's results of operations are included within the personal systems segment. the financial results of poly are included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended october 31, 2022, from the date of the acquisition.
on september 1, 2022, hp consummated its offer to exchange approximately $ 0.5billion of outstanding notes issued by poly for new notes issued by hp with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity date and redemption terms as the exchanged poly notes. see note 11, "borrowings" for detailed information.
of the total consideration, $ 109million related to cash settlement of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units was allocated to the purchase consideration, and $ 81million was expensed immediately. in addition, hp assumed unvested restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units ("assumed awards") with a preliminary estimated fair value of $ 47million allocated to future services to be expensed over the remaining service periods on a straight-line basis, of which $ 4million was attributed to purchase consideration. for the year ended october 31, 2022, hp recorded stock-based compensation expense of $ 3million related to these assumed awards.

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the "evaluation date"). at the time that the form 10-k for our fiscal year ended october 31, 2022 was filed on december 6, 2022, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in our sec reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to hp's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. subsequent to this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the evaluation date due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.
see management's report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting in item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.
remediation plan for the material weaknesses the company's management, under the oversight of the audit committee, is in the process of designing prevent and detect controls specific to the impacted business activity.
the company's management is also enhancing its processes and controls to help ensure the timely review of the soc-1
report in conjunction with designing and implementing related, effective complementary user entity controls associated with the sales incentive payment processing application.
while we have taken steps to implement our remediation plan, the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the enhanced controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the related controls are effective. the company will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and refine its remediation plan as appropriate.
changes in internal control over financial reporting as described above, we are taking steps to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. other than in connection with the remediation process described above, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the exchange act) occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

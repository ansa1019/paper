item 1a.    risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us.
business operations significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation or other necessary supplies or services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results.
increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, supplier consolidation which could limit our sources of supply kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report for these items, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in past years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. we utilize a variety of pricing structures to manage these risks but have not used derivative instruments.
a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products and disposable wipes, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials.
our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to help ensure we use energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses) and geopolitical factors. there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources.
increased cyber-security threats and computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations regarding the handling of personal data, such as the gdpr, lgpd, pipl and ccpa. any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, supplier, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. any such event, or any failure to comply with these data privacy requirements or other laws in this area, could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in legal liability, or regulatory or other penalties. in addition, we may incur large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events.
our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business. these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, user or system errors, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. the risk of cyber-based attacks is heightened with many of our employees working and accessing our technology infrastructure remotely. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.
we are in the process of upgrading our enterprise resource planning system (known as sap) to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations. the upgrade poses several challenges, including training of personnel, communication of new rules and procedures, migration of data, and the potential instability of the new system. moreover, there is no assurance that the new system will meet our current and future business needs or that it will operate as kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report designed. any significant failure or delay in the system upgrade could cause an interruption to our business and adversely affect our operations and financial results.
our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results.
our strategy includes operations growth outside the u.s., especially in developing markets such as china, eastern europe, asean and latin america. about half of our net sales come from markets outside the u.s. we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 33 countries and sell products in a substantial majority of countries around the world. our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks:
•exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts where available and economically advantageous. we do not generally hedge our income statement translation exposure with respect to foreign operations.
•increases in currency exchange restrictions. these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. or obtain currency exchange for u.s. dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries.
•adverse political conditions. risks related to political instability (including the war in ukraine), expropriation, new or revised legal or regulatory constraints, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences could adversely affect our financial results.
•greater economic volatility and vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions.
the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") and item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of highly inflationary accounting in argentina and turkey.
the war between russia and ukraine has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our operations in russia and the surrounding region. beginning in march 2022, we have implemented significant adjustments to our business in russia. we have substantially curtailed media, advertising and promotional activity and suspended capital investments at our single manufacturing facility in russia. consistent with the humanitarian nature of our products, we manufacture and sell only essential items in russia, such as baby diapers and feminine pads, which are critical to the health and hygiene of women, girls and babies. our ability to continue our reduced operations in russia may change as we continue to experience increased input costs, supply chain complexities, reduced consumer demand, restricted access to financial institutions and increased monetary, currency and payment controls. as the business, geopolitical, and regulatory environment concerning russia evolves, we may not be able to sustain the limited manufacture and sale of our products, and our assets may be partially or fully impaired. moreover, the war in ukraine could result in cyber-based attacks to our information technology systems, disruptions to foreign exchange rates and financial and credit markets and amplify or affect the other risk factors set forth in this part i, item 1a, any of which may adversely affect our business.
we face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks. the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has had and could continue to have negative impacts on our business, including causing significant volatility in demand for our products, changes in consumer behavior and preference, disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain operations, disruptions to our cost saving programs, limitations on our employees' ability to work and travel, significant changes in the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate and related currency and commodity volatility. despite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.
developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management), inclusion, equity and diversity, human rights and other sustainability or similar matters, or breaches of consumer, customer, supplier, employee or other confidential information, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. in addition, our products could face withdrawal, recall or other quality issues. consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity, potentially with negative perception of our products or brands. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination, or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products.
our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes or labor shortages, terrorism, epidemics, pandemics (including the ongoing covid-19 pandemic), import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events (including the war in ukraine), governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address.
we have a complex network of suppliers, including a number of sole-source and single-source suppliers for certain commodities and raw material inputs. in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these suppliers, third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these parties, manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our suppliers, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. in the case of our sole-source suppliers, failure to successfully negotiate satisfactory purchase terms could adversely impact our business.
we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees, suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results.
we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future, or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all.
we may periodically divest product lines or businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses. furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products.
the inability to effectively and efficiently manage acquisitions and divestitures with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.
we access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. our financial performance, our short- and long-term debt credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, geopolitical or national political developments (including those related to the ability of congress to raise the u.s. federal debt ceiling), the stability and liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy, could affect our access to, and the availability and cost of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay dividends in the future.
we regularly access the commercial paper market for ongoing funding requirements. a downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper. disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings.
disruptions in the credit markets, limitations on our ability to borrow, a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
climate change and other sustainability matters may adversely affect our business and operations.
there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. we have transition risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy and physical risks related to the physical impacts of climate change. transition risks include increased costs of carbon emission, increased cost to produce products in compliance with future regulations, increased raw materials cost, shifts in customer/consumer values and other legal, regulatory and technological risks. physical risks include the risk of direct damage to assets or supply chain disruption caused by severe weather events such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts. in addition, concern over climate change may result in new legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. despite our sustainability efforts, any failure to achieve our sustainability goals, including those aimed to reduce our impact on, improve or preserve the environment, or the perception (whether or not valid) that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change, could adversely affect our business and reputation.
there is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers, consumers, our employees and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including single-use and other plastic packaging and ingredient transparency. our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business.
marketing and competition increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business.
our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and e-tailers. with the consolidation of retail trade, both traditional retailers and e-tailers, we are dependent on key customers, and some of these customers, including large-format retailers and large e-tailers, may have significant bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory destocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
intense competition for sales of our products, changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, a growing e-commerce marketplace, and customers' and competitors' actions. our competitors for these markets include global, regional and local manufacturers, kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report including private label manufacturers. some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. e-commerce potentially intensifies competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. in order to stay competitive, it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, which could adversely affect our financial results.
we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products. demand for our products may change based on many factors, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products and mid to lower-tier value products, low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, negative customer or consumer response to pricing actions, consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to e-tailers, subscription services and direct to consumer businesses, changing consumer preferences due to increased concerns in regard to post-consumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability, or other changes in consumer trends or habits. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease.
our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. also, if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights, we may be less competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition.
legal and regulatory government regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
as a global company, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-bribery or anti-corruption, data privacy, product liability, product composition or formulation, packaging content or corporate responsibility after consumer purchase, environmental impact, intellectual property, employment, healthcare or other matters.
we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations. our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving customers, consumers, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, we cannot provide assurance that our employees and agents will follow our policies and procedures at all times. a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions, product recalls or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. whether or not a claim is successful, without merit or not fully pursued, negative publicity arising from allegations regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image.
in addition, new or revised laws, regulations or their interpretation may alter the environment in which we do business which could adversely impact our financial results. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance, or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs, excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials.
while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. even if we believe a claim is covered by kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.
we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. some jurisdictions have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this md&a is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our recent performance, financial condition and prospects. this discussion and analysis compares 2022 results to 2021. for a discussion that compares our 2021 results to 2020, see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7 of our 2021 annual report on form 10-k. the reference to "n.m." indicates that the calculation is not meaningful. in addition, we provide commentary regarding organic sales growth, which describes the impact of changes in volume, product mix and net selling prices on net sales. changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and exited businesses also impact the year-over-year change in net sales. dollar amounts are reported in millions, except per share dollar amounts, unless otherwise noted.
•liquidity and capital resources
•critical accounting policies and use of estimates
•information concerning forward-looking statements throughout this md&a, we refer to financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., or gaap, and are therefore referred to as non-gaap financial measures. these measures include adjusted gross and operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted other (income) and expense, net, and adjusted effective tax rate. we believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the financial measures used to evaluate management.
non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable gaap measures, and they should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.  there are limitations to these non-gaap financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded.  we compensate for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as a supplement to the gaap measures and by providing reconciliations of the non-gaap and comparable gaap financial measures.
the non-gaap financial measures exclude the following items for the relevant time periods as indicated in the reconciliations included later in this md&a:
•pension settlements - in 2022, pension settlement charges were recognized related to lump-sum distributions from pension plan assets exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs resulting in a recognition of deferred actuarial losses.
•acquisition of controlling interest in thinx - in the first quarter of 2022, we increased our investment in thinx. as a result of this transaction, a net benefit was recognized, primarily due to the non-recurring, non-cash gain recognized related to the remeasurement of the carrying value of our previously held equity investment to fair value partially offset by transaction and integration costs. see item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•2018 global restructuring program - in 2018, we initiated a restructuring program to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. the restructuring actions were completed in 2021. see item 8, note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report overview of business we are a global company focused on delivering products and solutions that provide better care for a better world, with manufacturing facilities in 33 countries, including our equity affiliates, and products sold in more than 175 countries and territories. our products are sold under well-known brands such as kleenex, scott, huggies, pull-ups, kotex and depend. we have three reportable business segments: personal care, consumer tissue and k-c professional. these business segments are described in greater detail in item 8, note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
•allocate capital in value-creating ways.
on february 24, 2022, we completed our acquisition of a majority and controlling share of thinx, an industry leader in the reusable period and incontinence underwear category, for total consideration of $181 consisting of cash of $53, the fair value of our previously held equity investment of $127, and certain share-based award costs of $1. see item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
on october 24, 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our neve tissue brand and related consumer and k-c professional tissue assets in brazil for $175, subject to certain working capital and other closing adjustments. the transaction also includes a licensing agreement to allow the acquirer to manufacture and market in brazil the kleenex, scott and wypall brands to consumers and away-from-home customers for a period of time. the transaction is pending customary conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of 2023. the assets included in the sale agreement have been reclassified to other current assets as of december 31, 2022.
•operating profit and net income attributable to kimberly-clark were $2,681 and $1,934 in 2022, respectively.
•diluted earnings per share were $5.72 in 2022 compared to $5.35 in 2021. results in 2022 include pension settlement charges of $0.12 and a net benefit of $0.20 associated with the acquisition of thinx, primarily due to the non-recurring, non-cash gain recognized related to the remeasurement of the carrying value of our previously held equity investment to fair value partially offset by transaction and integration costs. results in 2021 include net charges of $0.83 related to the 2018 global restructuring program.
•we continue to focus on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders. cash provided by operations was $2.7 billion in 2022. we raised our dividend in 2022 by 2 percent, the 50th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. altogether, share repurchases and dividends in 2022 amounted to $1.7 billion.
in 2023, we plan to continue to execute our strategies for long-term success which include delivering balanced, sustainable growth by growing our brands in-line with or ahead of category growth, leveraging our cost and financial discipline to fund growth and improve margins, and allocating capital in value-creating ways. our growth strategy is built on two pillars. elevate our core business is our first pillar and is driven by delivering value-added innovations and driving category opportunities. expanding our markets is our second pillar and emphasizes personal care.  both strategies are enabled by our focus on kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report accelerating and investing in our commercial capabilities through digital marketing, revenue growth management, consumer-inspired innovation and strong in-market execution.
our strong legacy of financial discipline supports our growth strategy by driving ongoing supply chain productivity through our force (focused on reducing costs everywhere) program, controlling discretionary spending, driving down working capital and maintaining the top-tier return on invested capital. our capital allocation strategy is consistent with our historical approach of disciplined capital spending, payment of a top tier dividend, evaluation of acquisition opportunities and allocation of excess cash flow to share repurchases.
we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which can affect our business operations and financial results. see item 1a, "risk factors" in this form 10-k for additional information.
covid-19 - the macro business environment experienced unprecedented volatility in recent years related to the continuing effect the global covid-19 pandemic has had on supply and demand dynamics.
we participate in fixed consumption categories where demand is generally very stable. in recent years, our sales have fluctuated, especially in consumer tissue and k-c professional, because of covid-19-related demand spikes, inventory destocking, and consumer usage pattern disruption. additionally, consumer incomes have generally been impacted negatively by the pandemic which can impact their purchasing patterns. covid-19 outbreaks and patterns are difficult to predict.
the pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains across the globe. a steep drop in aggregate demand at the beginning of the pandemic caused aggregate supply to sharply contract. when demand for goods resumed at the end of 2020, supply shortages led to record levels of inflation in commodities and other costs. in addition to inflation, logistics and distribution networks, especially in the u.s., have been severely impacted by container and truck shortages and significant labor supply issues. these effects have caused challenges getting input materials into our production facilities, production delays, and delays and meaningfully higher costs to get products from our production facilities to our customers. the net effect of the global supply chain disruption led to an unprecedented increase in costs in 2022 and 2021. the underlying causes of the disruption and higher costs will take time to be resolved.
birth rate trends - sales of our baby and child care products are highly correlated with birth rate trends. in recent years, birth rate declines in key countries, including china, south korea and the u.s., have pressured category volume growth rates. to help mitigate the effects of birth rate declines, we aim to drive sales growth at or ahead of category growth rates through innovation, premiumization, strong brand building plans and digital marketing investment as part of our elevate and expand growth strategy.
competition - our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace. our competitors include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers which offer products that are typically sold at lower prices. in particular, private label market share has been increasing in the tissue category. increased purchases of private label products could reduce net sales of our higher-margin products which would negatively impact our profitability. while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and e-tailers. this market environment has resulted in increased pressure on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue in the coming year.
pricing - our net sales growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address market conditions. we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand, the competitive environment, technological improvements and changes in our raw material, distribution, energy and other input costs. we increased our prices in 2022 in response to continuing inflation related to the ongoing impacts of the covid-19 pandemic and other market conditions, including the war in ukraine.  in 2023, we anticipate challenging market conditions to continue to impact pricing. price changes may affect net sales, earnings and market share in the near term as the market adjusts to new pricing and other market conditions.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report operating costs - our operating costs include raw materials, labor, selling, general and administrative expenses, taxes, currency impacts and financing costs. we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives, sourcing and hedging programs, and pricing actions. to remain competitive on our operating structure, we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability, such as our force program. in 2022, our results were impacted by an unprecedented increase in our costs, particularly for pulp, resin, distribution and energy, primarily related to covid-19 pandemic driven effects and the effects of the war in ukraine. we expect the higher cost environment will continue in 2023.
evolving consumer product and shopping preferences - the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve due to the rapid growth of ecommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. changing consumer preferences also include increased concerns in regard to post-consumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease. we believe our strategic growth focus, sustainability initiatives and continued investment in ecommerce capabilities has us well positioned relative to these changing dynamics.
volatility of global markets - our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations, including in d&e markets. some d&e markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions. volatility in these markets affects our production costs and the demand for our products. volatility in global consumer, commodity and foreign currency exchange rates increased significantly over the past few years and is expected to continue in the near term.
climate change - we operate in many regions around the world where our businesses could be disrupted by climate change. our climate change risk categories include risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy ("transition risks") and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change ("physical risks"). transition risks include increased costs of carbon emission, increased cost to produce products in compliance with future regulations, increased raw materials cost, shifts in customer/consumer values and other legal, regulatory and technological risks. physical risks include the risk of direct damage to assets or supply chain disruption caused by severe weather events such as floods, storms, wildfires and droughts. we continue to progress toward our 2030 sustainability goals which include elements that aim for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, use of natural forest fibers, use of plastics and use of water in water-stressed regions.
war in ukraine - beginning in march 2022, we have implemented significant adjustments to our business in russia. we have substantially curtailed media, advertising and promotional activity and suspended capital investments in our sole manufacturing facility in russia. consistent with the humanitarian nature of our products, we manufacture and sell only essential items in russia, such as baby diapers and feminine pads, which are critical to the health and hygiene of women, girls and babies. our russia business has represented approximately 1 to 2 percent of our net global sales, operating profit and total assets. our ability to continue our operations in russia may change as the situation evolves. our business in russia is experiencing increased input costs, supply chain complexities, reduced consumer demand and restricted access to financial institutions, as well as increased monetary, currency and payment controls. we are actively monitoring the situation, and as the business, geopolitical and regulatory environment concerning russia evolves, we may not be able to sustain the limited manufacture and sale of our products, and our assets may be partially or fully impaired. we are also monitoring the increased risk of cyber-based attacks as a result of the war in ukraine and have implemented additional cybersecurity measures designed to address the evolving threat landscape.

the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily superabsorbent materials, pulp and utilities. although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, we believe exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.
•our consolidated subsidiary, thinx, has issued common securities to the third-party minority owner, who has certain redemption rights to sell those securities to us. if the rights are exercised, it would require us to pay approximately $50 in 2023 and approximately $185 during a second exercise period of january 1, 2024 through june 30, 2026. see item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
•we will fund our defined benefit pension plans to meet or exceed statutory requirements and currently expect to contribute approximately $25 to these plans in 2023.
•other postretirement benefit payments are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. based upon those projections, we anticipate making annual payments for these obligations of approximately $50 through 2032.
•accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests.
investing our capital spending was $876 in 2022 and $1,007 in 2021. acquisition of business, net of cash acquired of $46 in 2022 reflected the acquisition of a controlling interest of thinx. we expect capital spending to be approximately $800 to $900 in 2023.
financing we issue long-term debt in the public market periodically. proceeds from the offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of maturing debt or outstanding commercial paper indebtedness. see item 8, note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for details.
our short-term debt, which consists of u.s. commercial paper with original maturities up to 90 days and/or other similar short-term debt issued by non-u.s. subsidiaries, was $373 as of december 31, 2022 (included in debt payable within one year on the consolidated balance sheet). the average month-end balance of short-term debt for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022 was $757. these short-term borrowings provide supplemental funding to support our operations. the level of short-term debt generally fluctuates depending upon the amount of operating cash flows and the timing of customer receipts and payments for items such as pension contributions, dividends and income taxes.
we maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in june 2026 and a $775 revolving credit facility which expires in june 2023.  these facilities, currently unused, support our commercial paper program, and would provide liquidity in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is unavailable for any reason.
the united kingdom's financial conduct authority, which regulates the london interbank offered rate ("libor"), is in the process of phasing out libor with completion of the phase out expected by june 30, 2023. we have evaluated the potential effect of the elimination of libor and do not expect the effect to be material. accounting guidance has been issued to ease the transition to alternative reference rates from a financial reporting perspective.
we paid $1.6 billion in dividends in 2022. the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 1.7 percent for 2023. we repurchase shares of kimberly-clark common stock from time to time pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. during 2022, we repurchased 779 thousand shares of our common stock at a cost of $100 through a broker in the open market. we are targeting full-year 2023 share repurchases of approximately $100 to $150, subject to market conditions.
we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, pension contributions, dividends and other needs for the foreseeable future.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report further, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the u.s. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations for the foreseeable future.
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. the critical accounting policies we used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. the critical judgments by management relate to accruals for sales incentives and trade promotion allowances, pension and other postretirement benefits, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments, and goodwill and other intangible assets. these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors.
sales incentives and trade promotion allowances trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products. rebate and promotion accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales. promotion accruals also consider estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and timing and costs of activities within the promotional programs. generally, the estimated redemption value of consumer coupons and related expense are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories, and the cost is recorded when the related revenue from customers is realized. our related accounting policies are discussed in item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
employee postretirement benefits substantially all regular employees in the u.s. and the united kingdom are covered by defined contribution retirement plans and certain u.s. and united kingdom employees previously earned benefits covered by defined benefit pension plans that currently provide no future service benefit (the "principal plans"). certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. our related accounting policies and account balances are discussed in item 8, note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
changes in certain assumptions could affect pension expense and the benefit obligations, particularly the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate the obligations:
as of december 31, 2022, the principal plans had cumulative unrecognized investment and actuarial losses of approximately $1.0 billion. these unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, and whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the "corridor" as required. if the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the principal plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, the impact on annual pension expense would not be material in 2023.
•discount rate. the discount (or settlement) rate used to determine the present value of our future u.s. pension obligation at december 31, 2022 was based on a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with cash flows that largely match the expected benefit payments of the plan. for the united kingdom plan, the discount rate was determined based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities. each year's expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate to determine the pension obligations. if the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the increase in annual pension expense would not be material in 2023, and the december 31, 2022 pension liability would increase by about $60.
•other assumptions. there are a number of other assumptions involved in the calculation of pension expense and benefit obligations, primarily related to participant demographics and benefit elections.
pension expense for defined benefit pension plans is estimated to approximate $100 in 2023, including estimated pension settlement charges. pension expense beyond 2023 will depend on future investment performance, our contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered participants in the plans.
substantially all u.s. retirees and employees have access to our unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. changes in significant assumptions could affect the consolidated expense and benefit obligations, particularly the discount rate used to calculate the obligations and the health care cost trend rate:
•discount rate. the determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above, and the methodology for each country is the same as the methodology used to determine the discount rate for that country's pension obligation. if the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, the impact to 2023 other postretirement benefit expense and the increase in the december 31, 2022 benefit liability would not be material.
deferred income taxes and potential assessments as a global organization, we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. changes in certain assumptions related to income taxes could significantly affect consolidated results, particularly with regard to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the u.s. and uncertain tax positions. our income tax related accounting policies, account balances and matters affecting income taxes are discussed in item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
•deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. we have recorded deferred tax assets related to, among other matters, income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards and have established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets. these carryforwards are primarily in non-u.s. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the u.s. foreign tax credits earned in the u.s. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. in determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. a valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
•undistributed earnings. as of december 31, 2022, we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries of approximately $7.4 billion. earnings of $3.7 billion were previously subject to u.s. federal income tax. any additional taxes due with respect to such previously-taxed foreign earnings, if repatriated, would generally be limited to foreign and u.s. state income taxes. deferred taxes have been recorded on $0.7 billion of earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries expected to be repatriated. we do not intend to distribute the remaining $3.0 billion of previously-taxed foreign earnings and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes for foreign and u.s. state income taxes on such earnings. we consider any excess of the amount for financial reporting over tax basis in our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. the determination of deferred tax liabilities on the amount of financial reporting over tax basis or the $3.0 billion of previously-taxed foreign earnings is not practicable.
•uncertain tax positions. we record our global tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which we operate. where we believe that a tax position is supportable for income tax purposes, the item is included in our income tax returns. where treatment of a position is uncertain, a liability is recorded based upon the expected most likely outcome taking into consideration the technical merits of the position based on specific tax regulations and facts of each matter. these liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities or the expiration of the statute of limitations.
kimberly-clark corporation - 2022 annual report goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 20 years. we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to measure the acquisition date fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired.
events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common shares, increased competition or loss of market share, obsolescence, product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over the product life, deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, or declining financial performance in comparison to projected results.
our related accounting policies, acquisitions of thinx and softex indonesia, and goodwill and other intangible assets account balances are discussed in item 8, notes 1, 3 and 4, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill in our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors such as macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environments, historical and projected financial performance, significant changes in the reporting unit and the magnitude of excess fair value over carrying amount from the previous quantitative impairment testing. if the result of a qualitative test indicates a potential for impairment, a quantitative test is performed. when a quantitative test is considered necessary, estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model and a market-based approach. we use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and earnings. the other key estimates and factors used in the discounted cash flow include, but are not limited to, discount rates, actual business trends experienced, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, inflation and terminal growth rates.
for 2022, we completed the required annual assessment of goodwill for impairment for all of our reporting units using a qualitative assessment as of the first day of the third quarter, and we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill significantly exceeds the carrying amount for each of our reporting units.
other intangible assets we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, primarily brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model and a market-based approach using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. the cash flows used in the discounted cash flow model are consistent with those we use in our internal planning, which gives consideration to actual business trends experienced and the long-term business strategy.
we performed our 2022 impairment assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the third quarter, and based upon a qualitative assessment, no impairment indicators were found to be present.
new accounting standards see item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting standards and their anticipated effects on our consolidated financial statements.
information concerning forward-looking statements certain matters contained in this report concerning the business outlook, including raw material, energy and other input costs, the anticipated cost savings from our force program, cash flow and uses of cash, growth initiatives, innovations, marketing and other spending, net sales, anticipated currency rates and exchange risks, including the impact in argentina and turkey, effective tax rate, contingencies and anticipated transactions of kimberly-clark, including dividends, share repurchases and pension contributions, constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and are based upon management's expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting kimberly-clark.
the assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. in addition, many factors outside our control, including the war in ukraine (including the related responses of consumers, customers, and suppliers and sanctions issued by the u.s., the european union, russia or other countries), pandemics (including the ongoing covid-19 outbreak and the related responses of governments, consumers, customers, suppliers and employees), epidemics, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the prices and availability of our raw materials, supply chain disruptions, failure to realize the expected benefits or synergies from our acquisition and disposition activity (including our pending agreement to sell our neve tissue brand and associated assets in brazil), changes in customer preferences, severe weather conditions, government trade or similar regulatory actions, potential competitive pressures on selling prices for our products, energy costs, general economic and political conditions globally and in the markets in which we do business, as well as our ability to maintain key customer relationships, could affect the realization of these estimates.
the factors described under item 1a, "risk factors" in this form 10-k, or in our other sec filings, among others, could cause our future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.

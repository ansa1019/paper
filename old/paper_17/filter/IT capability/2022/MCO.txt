item 1a. risk factors please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties that make an investment in the company's securities risky and provide important information for the understanding of the "forward-looking" statements discussed in item 7 of this form 10-k and elsewhere. these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on form 10-k.
the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances the company may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on moody's business, financial condition, operating results (including components of the company's financial results such as sales and profits), cash flows and stock price. these risk factors do not identify all risks that moody's faces. the company could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to the company or that the company currently does not consider to present significant risks. in addition to the effects of general economic conditions, including inflation and related monetary policy actions in response to inflation, and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in item 7 of this form 10-k and in the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of these risks discussed below.
a. legal and regulatory risks moody's faces risks related to u.s. laws and regulations affecting the credit rating industry and moody's customers.
moody's operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the u.s., including the reform act and the dodd-frank act. these regulations are complex, continually evolving and have tended to become more stringent over time. additionally, changes in congress may increase the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any new or existing legislation or directives by government authorities. see "regulation" in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information. the current laws and regulations:
-seek to encourage, and may result in, increased competition among cras and in the credit rating business;
-may result in alternatives to credit ratings or changes in the pricing of credit ratings;
-restrict the use of information in the development or maintenance of credit ratings;
-increase regulatory oversight of the credit markets and cra operations;
-provide the sec with direct jurisdiction over cras that seek nrsro status, and grant authority to the sec to inspect the operations of cras; and
-provide for enhanced oversight standards and specialized pleading standards, which may result in increases in the number of legal proceedings claiming liability for losses suffered by investors on rated securities and aggregate legal defense costs.
if these laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking or court rulings, reduce demand for credit ratings or increase costs, moody's may be unable to pass such costs through to customers. in addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. the company's compliance and efforts to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions can result in significant expenses. legal proceedings that are increasingly lengthy can result in uncertainty over and exposure to liability.
it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on moody's business and its customers' businesses. for example, new laws and regulations may affect mis's communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which mis's credit ratings are developed, assigned and communicated, affect the manner in which mis or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for mis's credit ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business, including by restricting or mandating business models for cras. further, speculation concerning the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives and the increased uncertainty over potential liability and adverse legal or judicial determinations may negatively affect moody's stock price. although these legislative and regulatory initiatives apply to cras and credit markets generally, they may affect moody's in a disproportionate manner. each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and can have a material adverse effect on moody's operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.
in addition, ma derives a significant amount of its sales from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight. u.s. banking regulators, including the office of the comptroller of the currency, the federal deposit insurance corporation, the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the consumer financial protection bureau, as well as many state agencies, have issued guidance to insured depository institutions and other providers of financial services on assessing and managing risks associated with third-party relationships, which include all business arrangements between a financial services provider and another entity, by contract or otherwise, and generally requires banks and financial services providers to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of a bank or financial service provider's business arrangement with third-party service providers, and instructs banks and financial service providers to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their third-party relationships. in light of this, ma's existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought to and may further revise their third-party risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with ma. this can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers, adversely affect ma's relationship with such customers, increase the costs of doing business with such customers and/or result in ma assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers.
table of contents moody's faces risks related to financial reforms outside the u.s. affecting the credit rating industry and moody's customers.
in addition to the extensive and evolving u.s. laws and regulations governing the industry, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to regulate cras and the markets for credit ratings. in particular, the eu has adopted a common regulatory framework for cras operating in the eu and continues to monitor the credit rating industry and analyze approaches that may strengthen existing regulation. credit ratings emanating from outside the eu are subject to esma's oversight if they are endorsed into the eu. additionally, other foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of cras and markets for credit ratings. see "regulation" in part 1, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information.
the eu and other jurisdictions, as discussed further below, adopt legislation and engage in rulemaking on an ongoing basis that significantly impacts operations and the markets for the company's products and services. future laws and regulations could extend to products and services not currently regulated. these regulations could: (i) affect the need for debt securities to be rated, (ii) expand supervisory remits to include credit ratings issued outside the home jurisdiction and used for regulatory purposes, (iii) increase the level of competition in the market for credit ratings, (iv) establish criteria for credit ratings or limit the entities authorized to provide credit ratings, (v) restrict the collection, use, accuracy, correction and sharing of personal information by cras, or (vi) regulate pricing (for example to require fees that are based on costs and are non-discriminatory) on products and services provided by ma such as those products that incorporate credit ratings and research originated by mis. future regulations could also affect products and services the company offers in the esg sector.
following the brexit implementation period that ended december 31, 2020 the mis u.k. registered cra ceased to be registered with and regulated by esma and became subject to regulation by the u.k. financial conduct authority ("fca"). mis put arrangements in place to endorse its u.k. credit ratings into the eu and its eu credit ratings into the u.k. on december 31, 2020, the u.k. also onshored the eu cra regulation, with certain necessary modifications, into u.k. domestic law (the "u.k. cra regulation"). the u.k. cra regulation contains requirements for the registration, regulation and supervision of cras based in the u.k. it also sets out the circumstances in which u.k. financial institutions can use credit ratings for regulatory purposes, as well as specific obligations for issuers, originators and sponsors relating to structured finance instruments. it is unclear if the regulation of cras in the eu and the u.k. will differ over time, and divergent regulation between the eu and the u.k. over time or differing interpretations by the fca and esma of cra regulation could adversely affect mis's business through additional operating obligations and resulting increased cost.
in february 2022, the fca published a portfolio letter on its cra supervision strategy. among other things, the fca explained that it takes a holistic approach to supervising cras. this means that if a cra or the group to which it belongs also carries on unregulated activities (for example, esg ratings), the fca may assess these unregulated activities as part of its supervision of regulated activities. cras need to be able to demonstrate that they have considered, and are actively managing, potential risks from any unregulated activities. the fca also identified its supervisory priorities for cras, which consist of: ratings process and methodologies; governance and oversight; market and perimeter risks; and operational resilience and resourcing. the fca also identified some other priority areas where it will be carrying out work relevant to cras, including a market study on accessing and using wholesale data and ongoing work on esg ratings.
both of moody's segments face risks related to financial reforms outside the u.s. affecting the credit rating industry and moody's customers. mis is a registered entity and is therefore subject to formal regulation and periodic or other inspections in the eu and other foreign jurisdictions, such as, but not limited to, hong kong and china, where it operates through registered subsidiaries. for example:
-in the eu and the u.k., applicable rules include procedural requirements with respect to credit ratings of sovereign issuers, liability for intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by applicable regulations, mandatory rotation requirements of cras hired by issuers of securities for credit ratings of resecuritizations, and restrictions on cras or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed. additional procedural and substantive requirements include conditions for the issuance of credit ratings, rules regarding the organization of cras, restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest, including requirements that fees be based on costs and non-discriminatory, and special requirements for credit ratings of structured finance instruments.
-in hong kong, applicable rules include liability for the intentional or negligent dissemination of false and misleading information and procedural requirements for the notification of certain matters to regulators. in addition, mis hong kong is subject to a code of conduct applicable to cras that imposes procedural and substantive requirements on the preparation and issuance of credit ratings, restrictions on activities deemed to create a conflict of interest including the disclosure of its compensation arrangements with rated entities and special requirements for credit ratings of structured finance instruments. a failure to comply with these procedural and substantive requirements also exposes mis hong kong to the risk of regulatory enforcement action which could result in financial penalties or, in serious cases, affect its ability to conduct credit rating activities in hong kong.
-in china, while mis is not a licensed cra, it does issue global credit ratings on chinese issuers from offices outside of china. in addition, the company holds a 30% investment in ccxi, a domestic cra licensed in china. china has laws applicable to domestic cras as well as foreign investment in such entities and entities in general (including national security review). such laws are broadly crafted and the implementation and interpretation of such laws are subject to the broad discretion of chinese regulators, which could affect the company's ability to conduct business in china.
-in addition, u.s. economic sanctions have increasingly targeted chinese persons. in response, china issued a blocking statute that establishes a framework for limiting the effect of foreign sanctions on chinese persons. blocking statutes typically create conflicts of law. an entity that is subject to conflicting laws in multiple jurisdictions may need to determine a means to comply with such laws. such conflicts could eventually affect the ability of entities to adhere to applicable laws.
with respect to ma, regulators in europe and other foreign markets in which ma is active have issued guidance similar to that issued in the u.s. relating to financial institutions' assessment and management of risks associated with third-party relationships. in light of this, ma's existing or potential bank and financial services customers subject to this guidance have sought and may further revise their third-party risk management policies and processes and the terms on which they do business with ma. this can result in delayed or reduced sales to such customers, adversely affect ma's relationship with such customers, increase the costs of doing business with such customers and/or result in ma assuming greater financial and legal risk under service agreements with such customers.
although moody's will monitor developments related to financial reforms outside the u.s. affecting the credit rating industry and moody's customers, moody's cannot predict the extent of such future laws and regulations, and the effect that they will have on moody's business or the potential for increased exposure to liability could be significant. for example, compliance with the eu, u.k. and other foreign regulations may increase costs of operations and could have a significant negative effect on moody's operations, profitability or ability to compete, or the markets for its products and services, including in ways that moody's presently is unable to predict. in addition, exposure to increased liability under the eu, u.k. regulations and regulations of other foreign jurisdictions may further increase costs and legal risks associated with the issuance of credit ratings and materially and adversely impact moody's results of operations. financial reforms in the eu, u.k. and other foreign jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on moody's business, operating results and financial condition.
the company faces exposure to litigation and government regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries related to rating opinions and other business practices.
moody's faces exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries related to mis's ratings actions, as well as other business practices and products within both mis and ma. when the market value of credit-dependent instruments has declined or defaults have occurred, whether as a result of difficult economic times, turbulent markets or otherwise, the number of investigations and legal proceedings that moody's has faced has increased significantly. parties who invest in securities rated by mis have pursued claims against mis or moody's for losses they faced in their portfolios. for instance, moody's faced numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation, government investigations and inquiries concerning events linked to the u.s. subprime residential mortgage sector and broader deterioration in the credit markets during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. evolving expectations on esg disclosures and reporting could also result in new regulatory actions at a corporate and business unit level. legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time to addressing other business issues, and any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions. risks relating to legal proceedings are heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the u.s. in addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations in the u.s. and in foreign jurisdictions. these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify. moody's may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time. furthermore, when moody's is unable to achieve dismissals at an early stage and litigation matters proceed to trial, the aggregate legal defense costs incurred by moody's increase substantially, as does the risk of an adverse outcome.
additionally, as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, moody's will continue to review the latest information available and may change its accounting estimates, which could require moody's to record or increase liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding ongoing investigations and civil litigation that the company currently faces. due to the number of these proceedings and the significant amount of damages sought, there is a risk that moody's will be subject to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other adverse results that have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.
the company is exposed to risks related to its compliance and risk management programs.
moody's operates in a number of countries, and as a result the company is required to comply with and quickly adapt to numerous international and u.s. federal, state and local laws and regulations. the company's ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, antitrust and securities trading laws, is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance, review and reporting systems, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and risk management personnel. moody's policies and procedures to identify, evaluate and manage the company's risks, including risks resulting from acquisitions, may not be fully effective, and moody's employees or agents may engage in misconduct, fraud or other errors. it is not always possible to deter such errors, and the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. if moody's employees violate its policies or if the company's risk management methods are not effective, the company may be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of the company's employees, fines, penalties, regulatory sanctions, injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets or other penalties, and may suffer harm to its reputation, financial condition and operating results.
table of contents moody's faces risks related to protecting its intellectual property rights.
moody's considers many aspects of its products and services to be proprietary. failure to protect the company's intellectual property adequately could harm its reputation and affect the company's ability to compete effectively. businesses the company acquires also involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges the company faces in protecting its strategic advantage. in addition, the company's operating results can be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. the lack of strong legal and technological intellectual property protections in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may increase our vulnerability and may pose risks to our business. from time to time, laws are passed that require publication of certain information, in some cases at no cost, that the company considers to be its intellectual property and that it currently sells or licenses for a fee, which could result in lost revenue.
unauthorized third parties may also try to obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary. it is also possible that moody's competitors or other entities could obtain patents related to the types of products and services that moody's offers, and attempt to require moody's to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to modify or redesign the products or services to avoid infringing, or to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents in order to continue developing and marketing the products and services. even if moody's attempts to assert or protect its intellectual property rights through litigation, it may require considerable cost, time and resources to do so, and there is no guarantee that the company will be successful. the company's ability to establish, maintain and protect its intellectual property and proprietary rights against theft, misappropriation or infringement could be materially and adversely affected by insufficient and/or changing proprietary rights and intellectual property legal protections in some jurisdictions and markets. these risks, and the cost, time and resources needed to address them, may increase as the company's business grows and its profile rises in countries with intellectual property regimes that are less protective than the rules and regulations applied in the united states.
as a global company, moody's is subject to taxation in the united states and various other countries and jurisdictions. as a result, our effective tax rate is determined based on the taxable income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates. moody's future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries or states with differing tax rates or other factors, including by increased earnings in jurisdictions where moody's faces higher tax rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which moody's is not able to realize the related tax benefit, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. changes in the tax, accounting and other laws, treaties, regulations, policies and administrative practices, or changes to their interpretation or enforcement, including changes applicable to multinational corporations such as the base erosion profit shifting and the global minimum tax rate initiatives being led by the organization for economic co-operation and development, which requires companies to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, and the european union's state aid rulings, could have a material adverse effect on the company's effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition and may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries.
in addition, moody's is subject to regular examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities around the world. moody's regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits; however, developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect the company. although the company believes its tax estimates and accruals are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its income tax provisions, accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, which could materially and adversely affect the company's business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.
moody's conducts operations in various countries outside the u.s. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from foreign sources. changes in the economic condition of the various foreign economies in which the company operates have an impact on the company's business. for example, economic uncertainty in the eurozone or elsewhere, including, but not limited to, in latin america or china, affects the number of securities offerings undertaken within those particular areas. in addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section, operations abroad expose moody's to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as:
-economic and geopolitical market conditions, including the effect of these conditions on customers and customer retention;
-restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into usd and the costs, including the tax impact, of repatriating cash held by entities outside the u.s.;
-u.s. laws affecting overseas operations, including domestic and foreign export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions, such as those related to the u.s.'s relationship with china and embargoes and sanctions laws with respect to russia, including the ongoing conflict between ukraine and russia, and venezuela;
-differing and potentially conflicting legal or civil liability, compliance and regulatory standards;
-current and future regulations relating to the imposition of mandatory rotation requirements on cras hired by issuers of securities;
-uncertainty regarding the future relationship between the u.s. and china, which may result in further restrictions or actions by the u.s. government with respect to doing business in china and/or by the chinese government with respect to business conducted by foreign entities in china;
-the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions;
-competition with cras that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions;
-complexities of compliance with employment laws and new data and cybersecurity rules in numerous jurisdictions.
additionally, moody's is subject to complex u.s., foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad, such as laws and regulations governing economic and trade sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, and anticorruption including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, the u.k. bribery act of 2010 and other similar local laws. the internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices the company has implemented may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. any determination or allegations, even if unfounded, that the company has violated sanctions, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on moody's business, operating results and financial condition. compliance with international and u.s. laws and regulations that apply to the company's international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, and restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on moody's reputation, its ability to attract and retain employees, its business, operating results and financial condition.
moody's ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which moody's is located, including: (i) new york city, the location of moody's headquarters, (ii) major cities worldwide in which moody's has offices, (iii) locations in europe that may be affected by the conflict in russia/ukraine; and (iv) locations in china used for certain moody's work. this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure (whether or not controlled by the company), including the company's electronic delivery systems, the company's data center facilities, or the internet, used by the company or third parties with or through whom moody's conducts business. many of the company's products and services are delivered electronically and the company's customers depend on the company's ability to receive, store, process, transmit and otherwise rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data and transactions on computer-based networks. some of moody's operations require complex processes and the company's extensive controls to reduce the risk of error inherent in our operations cannot eliminate such risk completely. to the extent the company grows through acquisitions, newly acquired businesses may not have invested in technological infrastructure and disaster recovery to the same extent as moody's has. as their systems are integrated into moody's, a vulnerability could be introduced, which could impact platforms across the company. the company's customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of the company's telecommunications, data centers, networks and other electronic delivery systems, including its websites and connections to the internet. the company's employees also depend on these systems for internal use. any significant failure, compromise, cyber-breach, interruption or a significant slowdown of operations of the company's infrastructure, whether due to human error, capacity constraints, hardware failure or defect, weather (including climate change), natural disasters, fire, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, pandemic (including the covid-19 pandemic), war or otherwise, may impair the company's ability to deliver its products and services.
moody's efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of its major operating systems may not be successful. the company relies on third-party providers, including, increasingly, cloud-based service providers, to provide certain essential services. while the company believes that such providers are reliable, the company has limited control over the performance of such providers. to the extent any of the company's third-party providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fails to adequately expand its services to meet the company's needs and the needs of the company's customers, the company could moody's 2022 10-k     27
table of contents experience lower revenues and higher costs. additionally, although the company maintains processes to prevent, detect and recover from a disruption, the company also does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. if a disruption occurs in one of moody's locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons' ability to service and interact with moody's customers will suffer. the company cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from the company's failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. a disruption to moody's operations or infrastructure may have a material adverse effect on its reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.
the economics of the company's business is dependent on the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets. recent financial market conditions, including decreased asset levels and flows into investment vehicles, increases in interest rates and other volatility has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on the volume of debt securities issued.
moody's business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in world financial markets. furthermore, issuers of debt securities have increasingly elected to issue securities without ratings or securities which are rated or evaluated by non-traditional parties such as financial advisors, rather than traditional cras, such as mis. a majority of moody's credit-rating-based revenue is transaction-based, and therefore it is especially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. conditions that reduce issuers' ability or willingness to issue debt securities, such as market volatility, declining growth, currency devaluations, changes in laws (including tax-related laws) or other adverse economic trends, reduce the number and dollar-equivalent volume of debt issuances for which moody's provides ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees moody's earns in its ratings business.
current market, economic and government factors are negatively impacting the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings, which is materially and adversely affecting the company's business, operating results and financial condition. these factors include increases in interest rates (as well as the related monetary policy by governments in the response to inflation), the withdrawal of covid-19 economic stimulus, inflationary pressures, increases in mortgage rates, widening credit spreads, regulatory and political developments (including uncertainty in various jurisdictions where moody's operates), difficult economic conditions, growth in the use of alternative sources of credit, and defaults by significant issuers. further declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect the company's business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.
moody's initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business, including the 2022 - 2023 geolocation restructuring program, may not be sufficient. cost reductions, including those associated with this program, may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the short term, due in part to rent, technology, compliance, compensation and other fixed costs associated with some of the company's operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings. further, cost-reduction initiatives, including those under-taken to date, could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in order to accommodate any unexpected increase in the demand for ratings. further volatility in the financial markets, including continued decreases in the volumes of debt securities and increases in interest rates, may have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition, which the company may not be able to successfully offset with cost reductions.
the company faces increased pricing pressure from competitors and/or customers.
there is price competition in the credit rating, research, and credit risk management markets, as well as in the market for research, business intelligence and analytical services offered by ma. moody's faces competition globally from other cras and from investment banks and brokerage firms that offer credit opinions in research, as well as from in-house research operations. competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and services, as well as increased competition from non-nrsros that evaluate debt risk for issuers or investors. at the same time, a challenging business environment and consolidation among both competitors and customers, particularly those involved in structured finance products and commercial real estate, and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of competitors and reduce the company's customer base. recent weak economic growth has intensified competitive pricing pressures, which may result in customers' use of free or lower-cost information that is available from alternative sources or their development of alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk that replace the products currently purchased from moody's. while moody's seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and services, it can lose market share when its pricing is not sufficiently competitive. in addition, the reform act was designed to encourage competition among rating agencies. the formation of additional nrsros may increase pricing and competitive pressures. furthermore, in some of the countries in which moody's operates, governments may provide financial or other support to local rating agencies. any inability of moody's to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of its products and services will have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.
28     moody's 2022 10-k table of contents the company is exposed to reputation and credibility concerns.
moody's reputation and the strength of its brand are key competitive strengths. to the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or moody's, relative to its competitors, suffers a loss in credibility, moody's business will be significantly impacted. factors that may have already affected credibility and could potentially continue to have an impact in this regard include the appearance of a conflict of interest, the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities, the timing and nature of changes in ratings, a major compliance failure, negative perceptions or publicity and increased criticism by users of ratings, regulators and legislative bodies, including as to the ratings process, including as to the company's recent esg initiatives, and its implementation with respect to one or more securities and intentional, poor representation of our products and services by our partners or agents, manipulation of our products and services by third parties, or unintentional misrepresentations of moody's products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, social media or other external communications. operational errors, whether by moody's or a moody's competitor, could also harm the reputation of the company or the credit rating industry. damage to reputation and credibility could have a material adverse impact on moody's business, operating results and financial condition, as well as on the company's ability to find suitable candidates for acquisition.
the markets for credit ratings, research, credit risk management services, business intelligence and analytical services are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer and investor demands, and evolving regulatory requirements, industry standards and market preferences. the ability to develop and successfully launch and maintain innovative products, technologies and services that anticipate customers' and investors' changing requirements and utilize emerging technological trends in a timely and cost-effective manner is a key factor in maintaining market share. moody's competitors include both established companies with significant financial resources, brand recognition, market experience and technological expertise, and smaller companies which may be better poised to quickly adopt new or emerging technologies or respond to customer requirements. competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by moody's, or may position, price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by moody's. moody's also competes indirectly against consulting firms and technology and information providers, some of whom are also suppliers to moody's; these indirect competitors could in the future choose to compete directly with moody's, cease doing business with moody's or change the terms under which they do business with moody's in a way that could negatively impact our business. in addition, customers or others may develop alternative, proprietary systems for assessing risk, including credit and climate risk. such developments could affect demand for moody's products and services and its growth prospects. further, the increased availability in recent years of free or relatively inexpensive internet information may reduce the demand for moody's products and services. moody's growth prospects also could be adversely affected by moody's failure to make necessary or optimal capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements and the inability of its information technologies to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors. any inability of moody's to compete successfully may have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition.
moody's success depends upon its ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled, experienced professionals, including financial analysts. competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense, and moody's ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing industries. rising expenses including wage inflation, and global labor shortages could adversely affect moody's ability to attract and retain high-quality employees. as greater focus has been placed on executive compensation at public companies, in the future, moody's may be required to alter its compensation practices in ways that adversely affect its ability to attract and retain talented employees. investment banks, investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody's. moody's also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the u.s. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. we could also fail to effectively respond to evolving perceptions and goals of those in our workforce or whom we might seek to hire, including in response to changes brought on by the covid-19 pandemic, with respect to flexible working or other matters. there is a risk that even when the company invests significant resources in attempting to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, it will not succeed in its efforts, and its business could be harmed. further, employee expectations in areas such as environmental, social matters and corporate governance have been rapidly evolving and increasing. a failure to adequately meet employee expectations may result in an inability to attract and retain talented employees.
moody's is highly dependent on the continued services of robert fauber, the president and chief executive officer, and other senior officers and key employees. the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason and moody's inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material adverse effect on moody's business, operating results and financial condition.
table of contents moody's acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions or investments may not produce anticipated results exposing the company to future significant impairment charges relating to its goodwill, intangible assets or property and equipment.
moody's regularly evaluates and enters into acquisitions, dispositions or other strategic transactions and investments to strengthen its business and grow the company. for example, moody's acquired bureau van dijk in 2017, reis in 2018, regulatory datacorp (rdc) in 2020, and rms in 2021. such transactions and investments present significant challenges and risks. the company faces intense competition for acquisition targets, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect moody's ability to complete such transactions on favorable terms or at all. additionally, the company makes significant investments in technology, including software for internal use, which can be expensive, time-intensive and complex to develop and implement.
the anticipated growth, synergies and other strategic objectives of completed transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. any strategic transaction involves a number of risks, including unanticipated challenges regarding integration of operations, technologies and new employees; the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by the company prior to closing a transaction; unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures; scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities; failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business; future developments that impair the value of purchased goodwill or intangible assets; diversion of management's focus from other business operations; failure to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; disputes or litigation arising out of acquisitions or dispositions; challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business; coordination of product, sales, marketing and program and systems management functions; integration of employees from the acquired business into moody's organization; integration of the acquired business's accounting, information technology, human resources, legal and other administrative systems with moody's; risks that acquired systems expose us to cybersecurity risks; and for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction or investment may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. as a result, the failure of acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions and investments to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on moody's business, operating results and financial condition.
at december 31, 2022, moody's had $5,839 million of goodwill and $2,210 million of intangible assets on its balance sheet. approximately 94% of the goodwill and intangible assets reside in the ma business, including those related to bureau van dijk and rms, and are allocated to the two reporting units within ma. the remaining 6% of goodwill and intangible assets reside in mis and primarily relate to icra. failure to achieve business objectives and financial projections in any of these reporting units could result in a significant asset impairment charge, which would result in a non-cash charge to operating expenses. goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. determining whether an impairment of goodwill exists can be especially difficult in periods of market or economic uncertainty and turmoil, and requires significant management estimates and judgment. in addition, the potential for goodwill impairment is increased during periods of economic uncertainty. an asset impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on moody's business, operating results and financial condition.
the company's operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted by future effects of the covid-19 pandemic. the future impact of the pandemic on the company's operations and financial performance as well as the performance of our customers, depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals' actions (including restrictions on travel and workforce pressures); actions taken in response to global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the availability of federal, state, local or non-u.s. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; the potential emergence of new covid-19 variants; uncertainty presented by approved vaccines, corresponding rollout and unanticipated consequences of such vaccines; and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides. these future impacts may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks, such as those surrounding cybersecurity due to increased remote work, described in our risk factors in this form 10-k.
as a global company, our employees and offices are subject to risks related to the impact of climate change. we have offices in locations that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and extreme weather. in addition, continued reliable energy sources are critical for business continuity globally and those sources too can be impacted by extreme weather. the frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure has the potential to disrupt the company's ongoing operations, as well as the operations of our vendors and customers, and may result in losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.
c. technology risks the company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.
the company's operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations and confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees in the company's computer systems and networks, and in those of its third party vendors. unauthorized disclosure of
30     moody's 2022 10-k table of contents this information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us. the risks the company faces range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats that target the company because of its prominence in the global marketplace, or due to its ratings of sovereign debt. breaches of moody's or moody's vendors' technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks some of which may be carried out by state-sponsored actors, hacking, "phishing" attacks, computer viruses, social media impersonation, ransomware, or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other actions, may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the company's or such vendors' web sites or systems, applications, data processing, or disruption of other business operations, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the company (including information about moody's business, employees or customers), as well as sensitive personally identifiable information (pii), the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. measures that moody's takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective. additionally, the company may be exposed to additional threats as the company migrates its data from legacy systems to cloud-based solutions, and increased dependence on third parties to store cloud-based data subjects the company to further cyber risks. further, many of our employees work remotely, which magnifies the importance of the integrity of our remote access security measures and may expose the company to additional cyber risks.
the company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security measures in order to protect its systems and data, including employee training, disaster plans, and technical defenses. the cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex, and sophisticated global cyber threats. despite the company's best efforts, it is not fully insulated from, and has in the past experienced, security threats and system disruptions. although past incidents have not had a material adverse effect on the company's operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. because the methods used for these systems cyberattacks are rapidly changing, the company, despite significant focus and investment, may be unable to anticipate/deploy sufficient protections against such incidents. further, the extent of a particular security incident and the steps needed to investigate may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident, including the extent of the harm and how best to remediate it, is known. recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity compliance requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers. cybersecurity incidents, including the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, could cause reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, fines, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the company's customers' information, or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the company. in addition, disclosure or media reports of actual or perceived security vulnerabilities to the company's systems or those of the company's third parties, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could lead to reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, or increased regulatory actions oversight and scrutiny.
any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on moody's business, operating results and financial condition.
the company is exposed to risks related to protection of personal information to conduct its operations, the company regularly moves data across national borders, and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security such as the federal trade commission act in the united states, the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") in the european union, the general data protection regulation in the u.k., the cyber security law, the data security law, and the personal information protection law in china and various other international, federal, state and local laws and regulations. the scope of the laws that may be applicable to moody's is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. for example, gdpr, which became effective in may 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union privacy law and added a broad array of requirements for processing personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches. failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. additionally, other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. further, laws such as the california consumer privacy act of 2018 ("ccpa"), require among other things, covered companies to provide disclosures to consumers, and affords consumers the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. the california privacy rights act of 2020 ("cpra") became effective on january 1, 2023. the effects of non-compliance with the ccpa, cpra and other similar data privacy laws in other jurisdictions are significant, and may require the company to modify its data processing practices and policies and to incur additional costs and expenses. all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements have required changes to certain business practices, thereby increasing costs, requiring significant management time and attention, and subjecting the company to negative publicity, as well as remedies that may harm its business, including fines, modified demands or orders, the cessation of existing business practices, and exposure to litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties.
table of contents the company is dependent on the use of third-party software, data, hosted solutions, data centers, cloud and network infrastructure (together, "third party technology"), and any reduction in third-party product quality or service offerings, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
moody's relies on third party technology in connection with its product development and offerings and operations. the company depends on the ability of third party technology providers to deliver and support reliable products, enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, provide data necessary to develop and maintain its products and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. the third party technology moody's uses can become obsolete or restrictive, incompatible with future versions of the company's products, fail to be comprehensive or accurate, unavailable or fail to operate effectively, and moody's business could be adversely affected when the company is unable to timely or effectively replace such third party technology.
the company also monitors its use of third party technology to comply with applicable license and other contractual requirements. despite the company's efforts, the company cannot ensure that such third parties will permit moody's use in the future, resulting in increased third party technology acquisition costs and loss of rights. in addition, the company's operating costs could increase if license or other usage fees for third party technology increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to third party technology are substantial. in the ordinary course, our third-parties, including our vendors, are subject to various forms of cyber attacks. to date, such attacks have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact. some of these third-party suppliers are also moody's competitors, increasing the risks noted above. when any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the moody's corporation consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements. see "forward-looking statements" commencing on page 61 and item 1a. "risk factors" commencing on page 23 for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and other factors associated with these statements.
mis publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on a wide range of debt obligations, programs and facilities, and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide, including various corporate, financial institution and governmental obligations, and structured finance securities.
ma is a global provider of: i) data and information; ii) research and insights; and iii) decision solutions, which help companies make better and faster decisions. ma leverages its industry expertise across multiple risks such as credit, market, financial crime, supply chain, catastrophe and climate to deliver integrated risk assessment solutions that enable business leaders to identify, measure and manage the implications of interrelated risks and opportunities.
current matters impacting moody's business current macroeconomic uncertainties/market volatility the company is monitoring current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that have contributed to declines in rated issuance volumes in 2022. a substantial portion of mis's revenue is impacted by the level of issuance activity in the fixed income capital markets, both in the u.s. and internationally. while market volatility in 2022 has resulted in declines in rated issuance volumes, the company believes that these declines are predominantly cyclical in nature. however, due to various uncertainties, moody's is unable to predict the severity and duration of current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and their potential impact on future ratings issuance volumes. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further disclosure relating to these risks.
russia/ukraine conflict the company is closely monitoring the impact of the ongoing russia/ukraine conflict on all aspects of its business. in response to the conflict, the company is no longer conducting commercial operations in russia for both mis and ma and is complying with all applicable regulatory restrictions set forth by the jurisdictions in which moody's operates. furthermore, the company also has withdrawn mis credit ratings on russian entities.
while moody's russian operations and net assets are not material, broader global market volatility, which partially relates to uncertainties surrounding the conflict, has contributed to an adverse impact on rated issuance volumes in 2022. this impact to rated issuance volumes is more fully discussed in the "results of operations" section of this md&a. the company is unable to predict either the near-term or longer-term impact that the conflict may have on its financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties regarding the severity and duration of the conflict and its broader potential macroeconomic impact.
the company continues to closely monitor the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business. the company continues to monitor regional developments relating to the covid-19 pandemic to inform decisions regarding its offices and its business travel policies. as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form 10-k, the company has reopened all of its offices for employees to access.
the covid-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on the company's reported results to date and is currently not expected to have a material adverse impact on its financial outlook. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further disclosure relating to the risks of the covid-19 pandemic on the company's business.
critical accounting estimates moody's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires moody's to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. on an ongoing basis, moody's evaluates its critical accounting estimates. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management's judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
table of contents goodwill and other acquired intangible assets at july 31st of each year, moody's evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, defined as an operating segment (i.e., mis and ma), or one level below an operating segment (i.e., a component of an operating segment).
the company has four reporting units: two within the company's ratings business (one for the icra business and one that encompasses all of moody's other ratings operations) and two reporting units within ma consisting of businesses that offer: i) data and data-driven analytical solutions; and ii) risk-management software, workflow and cre solutions.
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two-step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level. in the first step, the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount. if a determination is made based on the qualitative factors that an impairment does not exist, the company is not required to perform further testing. if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the fair value of the reporting unit will be quantitatively determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired, and the company is not required to perform further testing. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the company will record a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions, realignments or if there are indicators of potential impairment. for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude that no impairment exists using only a qualitative approach, the company's accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years.
the company last performed quantitative assessments on all reporting units at july 31, 2021, pursuant to a change in reporting unit structure in the ma reportable segment. the quantitative assessments performed at july 31, 2021 resulted in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values for all reporting units.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are more fully described below. in addition, the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units.
other assets and liabilities, including applicable corporate assets, are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units.
at july 31, 2022, the company performed qualitative assessments for each of the four reporting units. these qualitative assessments resulted in the company determining that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.
methodologies and significant estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units:
the following is a discussion regarding the company's methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units, excluding icra, at july 31, 2021 (the date of the last quantitative assessment). as icra is a publicly traded company in india, the company was able to observe its fair value based on its market capitalization.
the fair value of each reporting unit, excluding icra, was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples. the discounted cash flow analysis requires significant estimates, including projections of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit that are based on internal budgets and strategic plans, expected long-term growth rates, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of each reporting unit that could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill, which could be material to the company's financial position and results of operations. moody's allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition.
the sensitivity analyses on the future cash flows and wacc assumptions are described below. these key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology require significant management judgment:
-future cash flow assumptions - the projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. these projections are consistent with the company's operating budget and strategic plan. cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the quantitative goodwill impairment test were utilized in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. the growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue based on new customer acquisition and new products. beyond five years, a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real gdp growth rates. a sensitivity analysis of the revenue growth rates was performed on all reporting units. for each reporting unit analyzed, a 10% reduction in the revenue growth rates used would still result in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.
-wacc - the wacc is the rate used to discount each reporting unit's estimated future cash flows. the wacc is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity. the cost of equity is based on a risk-free interest rate and an equity risk factor, which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit's cash flows. the cost of debt component is calculated as the
36     moody's 2022 10-k table of contents weighted average cost associated with all of the company's outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the wacc. the cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested. the wacc for all reporting units ranged from 8.0% to 8.5% as of july 31, 2021. differences in the wacc used between reporting units is primarily due to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units. a sensitivity analysis of the wacc was performed on all reporting units as of july 31, 2021 for each reporting unit. for all reporting units, an increase in the wacc of one percentage point would still result in fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, which consist primarily of amortizable intangible assets, operating lease rou assets and property and equipment, are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
under the first step of the recoverability assessment, moody's compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group to its carrying value. if the undiscounted future cash flows are greater than the carrying value, no further assessment is required. if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, moody's proceeds with step two of the assessment. under step two of this assessment, moody's is required to determine the fair value of the asset or asset group and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. in performing this assessment, moody's must include assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value, including the estimated future cash flows and discount rate. moody's must apply judgment in developing estimated future cash flows and in the determination of market participant assumptions.
income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. the company's tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions. the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic 740. therefore, income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes, and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes.
the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps. the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company's consolidated financial statements and associated penalties, if any, as part of other non-operating expenses.
for utps, asc topic 740 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company, there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company's operating results or financial condition.
revenue recognition and costs to obtain a contract with a customer revenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
the discussion below outlines areas of the company's revenue recognition process that require significant management judgment and estimates. refer to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive discussion regarding the company's accounting policies relating to the recognition of revenue and costs to obtain a contract with a customer.
in the mis segment, the ssp for both ratings and monitoring services is generally based upon directly observable selling prices where the rating or monitoring service is sold separately.
table of contents costs to obtain a contract with a customer:
costs incurred to obtain customer contracts, such as sales commissions, are deferred and recorded within other current assets and other assets when such costs are determined to be incremental to obtaining a contract, would not have been incurred otherwise and the company expects to recover those costs. these costs are amortized to expense on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of products or services to the customer for which the asset relates. depending on the line of business to which the contract relates, this amortization period may be based upon the average economic life of the products sold or average period for which services are provided, inclusive of anticipated contract renewals.
contingencies accounting for contingencies, including those matters described in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome. in many cases, the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties, including governmental or judicial bodies. the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements, as well as the related disclosures, represent management's best estimates of the current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate. the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may, in the future, adjust its associated liabilities.
for claims, litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes, the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated and periodically adjusts these as appropriate. when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts, the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range. in instances when a loss is reasonably possible but uncertainties exist related to the probable outcome and/or the amount or range of loss, management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if material. as additional information becomes available, the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly. moody's also discloses material pending legal proceedings pursuant to sec rules and other pending matters as it may determine to be appropriate.
in view of the inherent difficulty of assessing the potential outcome of legal proceedings, governmental, regulatory and legislative investigations and inquiries, claims and litigation and similar matters and contingencies, particularly when the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties, the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters. the company also may be unable to predict the impact (if any) that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted, on its competitive position or on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses, management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on its operations and financial condition and to accrue for and disclose such matters as and when required. however, because such matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the ultimate outcome of such matters, including the amount of any loss, may differ from those estimates.
pension and other retirement benefits the expenses, assets and liabilities that moody's reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances. these significant assumptions include the following:
-long-term expected return on pension plan assets based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan's portfolio (which is principally comprised of equity and fixed-income investments); and
the discount rates used to measure the present value of the company's benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december 31, 2022 were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan's projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the ftse pension discount curve. the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan.
moody's major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. in determining these assumptions, the company consults with third-party actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate. while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses, assets and liabilities related to the company's retirement plans.
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used, actuarial gains or losses arise. excluding differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns on plan assets, the company amortizes, as a component of annual pension expense, total outstanding actuarial gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain/loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. for moody's retirement plans, the total actuarial losses as of december 31, 2022 that have not been recognized in annual expense are $68 million, and moody's expects the net periodic expense related to the amortization of net actuarial (losses)/gains will be immaterial in 2023.
38     moody's 2022 10-k table of contents for moody's funded u.s. pension plan, the differences between the expected long-term rate of return assumption and actual returns could also affect the net periodic pension expense. as permitted under asc topic 715, the company amortizes the impact of asset returns over a five-year period for purposes of calculating the market-related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets' component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization. as of december 31, 2022, the company has an unrecognized loss of $106 million, of which $19 million will be recognized in the market-related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of 2023 expense.
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage-point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody's 2023 income before provision for income taxes. these effects have been calculated using the company's current projections of 2023 expenses, assets and liabilities related to moody's retirement plans, which could change as updated data becomes available.
investments in non-consolidated affiliates equity method investments are reviewed for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. these investments are written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value that is other-than-temporary.
for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value for which the company does not have significant influence, moody's generally elects to measure these investments at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes as of the date that an observable transaction takes place.
the company performs an assessment on a quarterly basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment for its investments in non-consolidated affiliates. if there are indicators of impairment, the company estimates the investment's fair value and records an impairment if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value.
in situations where estimation of fair value is required for investments in non-consolidated affiliates, the company considers various factors, including: recent observable investee equity transactions, comparable public company/precedent transaction multiples and discounted cash flow models. the estimation of fair value for these investments may involve significant judgment.
other estimates in addition to the critical accounting estimates described above, there are other accounting estimates within moody's consolidated financial statements. management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody's consolidated financial statements are appropriate. however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody's consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
reportable segments the company is organized into two reportable segments at december 31, 2022: mis and ma, which are more fully described in the section entitled "the company" above and in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements.
table of contents results of operations this section of this form 10-k generally discusses year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021 financial results and year-to-year comparisons between these years. discussions related to the year ended december 31, 2020 financial results and year-to-year comparisons between the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2021.

- higher costs of approximately $15 million relating to strategic initiatives to support business growth coupled with enhancements to technology infrastructure to enable automation, innovation and efficiency.
partially offset by: - inorganic growth from acquisitions of approximately $30 million; and
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is driven by higher amortization of intangible assets reflecting recent m&a activity (most notably rms) coupled with amortization of internally developed software, which is primarily related to the development of ma saas solutions.

mis: global revenue ⇓ $1,113 million         u.s. revenue ⇓ $710 million         non-u.s. revenue ⇓ $403 million the decrease in global mis revenue primarily relates to a 31% decrease in rated issuance volumes, which resulted in transaction revenue declining $1,128 million compared to the same period in the prior year. the decline in rated issuance volumes compared to 2021 reflected muted credit market activity across all sectors given ongoing market volatility, central bank actions, high levels of balance sheet cash, as well as heightened inflationary and recessionary concerns.
(1) other includes: recurring monitoring fees of a rated debt obligation and/or entities that issue such obligations as well as fees from programs such as commercial paper, medium term notes and icra corporate finance revenue.
the most notable drivers of the decrease compared to 2021 reflected declines in leveraged finance and investment-grade issuance activity resulting from muted credit market activity given ongoing market volatility, central bank actions, high levels of balance sheet cash, as well as heightened inflationary and recessionary concerns compared to a strong prior year period.
table of contents the most notable driver of the decline compared to 2021 was a decrease in clo refinancing activity in the u.s. and emea resulting from the widening of credit spreads for this asset class.
-a decline in opportunistic issuance, as banks, insurers and asset management issuers were well capitalized following financing activity in the prior year period ahead of anticipated interest rate increases.
-declines in u.s. public finance revenue resulting from market volatility, which increased funding costs, coupled with issuers in this sector being currently well capitalized; and
-declines in sovereign, project finance and infrastructure finance rated issuance volumes in emea resulting from market volatility and rising funding costs.
- lower incentive compensation accruals and performance-based equity compensation of approximately $165 million, which aligns with actual/projected financial and operating performance.                                                                                                                                      - higher bad debt reserves of approximately $20 million resulting from the impact of the russia/ukraine conflict; and
ma: global revenue ⇑ $363 million         u.s. revenue ⇑ $200 million         non-u.s. revenue ⇑ $163 million the 15% increase in global ma revenue reflects strong growth both in the u.s.

52     moody's 2022 10-k table of contents ma: operating and sg&amp;a expense ⇑ $142 million the increase in operating and sg&a expenses compared to 2021 is primarily due to growth in both compensation and non-compensation costs of $125 million and $17 million, respectively, with the most notable drivers of the increase reflecting:
- inorganic expense growth from acquisitions of approximately $150 million.         - operating and integration-related costs associated with recent acquisitions of approximately $65 million;partially offset by:
- lower consulting/professional fees of approximately $45 million due in part to a higher proportion of costs capitalized relating to the development of saas-based solutions.
ma: adjusted operating margin 30.2% ⇑ 420bps the adjusted operating margin increase for ma is primarily due to the 15% increase in global ma revenue partially offset by operational and integration-related costs associated with recent acquisitions.
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is driven by higher amortization of intangible assets reflecting recent m&a activity (most notably rms) and amortization of internally developed software relating to the development of saas-based solutions.
moody's maintains a presence in more than 40 countries. in 2022, approximately 40% of the company's revenue and approximately 38% of the company's expenses were denominated in functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar, principally in the british pound and the euro. as such, the company is exposed to market risk from changes in fx rates. as of december 31, 2022, approximately 51% of moody's assets were located outside the u.s., making the company susceptible to fluctuations in fx rates. the effects of translating assets and liabilities of non-u.s. operations with non-u.s. functional currencies to the u.s. dollar are charged or credited to oci.
the effects of revaluing assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary's functional currency are charged to other non-operating income (expense), net in the company's consolidated statements of operations. accordingly, the company enters into foreign exchange forwards to partially mitigate the change in fair value on certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary's functional currency. the following table shows the impact to the fair value of moody's 2022 10-k     53

(1)refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this form 10-k for further detail on the forward contracts.
the change in fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts would be offset by fx revaluation gains or losses on underlying assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary's functional currency.
cross-currency swaps as of december 31, 2022, the company had cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries, for which the notional values and corresponding interest rates are disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10-k.
euro-denominated debt as of december 31, 2022, the company has designated €500 million of the 2015 senior notes and €750 million of the 2019 senior notes as a net investment hedge to mitigate fx exposure relating to euro denominated net investments in subsidiaries. if the euro were to strengthen 10% relative to the u.s. dollar, there would be an approximate $133 million unfavorable adjustment to oci related to these net investment hedges. this adjustment would be offset by favorable translation adjustments on the company's euro net investment in subsidiaries.
interest rate and credit risk:
the company's interest rate risk management objectives are to reduce the funding cost and volatility to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to a desired risk profile. moody's uses interest rate swaps as deemed necessary to assist in accomplishing these objectives. the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its various outstanding fixed-rate debt for which the fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt fluctuates based on changes in interest rates. the company has entered into interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on certain of its long-term debt to a floating interest rate based on the 3-month and 6-month libor as well as sofr. these swaps are adjusted to fair market value based on prevailing interest rates at the end of each reporting period and fluctuations are recorded as a reduction or addition to the carrying value of the borrowing, while net interest payments are recorded as interest expense/income in the company's consolidated statement of operations. a hypothetical change of 100 bps in the libor/sofr-based swap rate would result in an approximate $110 million change to the fair value of the swaps, which would be offset by the change in fair value of the hedged item.
additional information on these interest rate swaps is disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements located in item 8 of this form 10-k.
moody's cash equivalents consist of investments in high-quality investment-grade securities within and outside the u.s. with maturities of three months or less when purchased. the company manages its credit risk exposure by allocating its cash equivalents among various money market deposit accounts and certificates of deposit and by limiting the amount it can invest with any single issuer. short-term investments primarily consist of certificates of deposit.
54     moody's 2022 10-k table of contents liquidity and capital resources moody's remains committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by both investing in the company's employees and growing the business through targeted organic initiatives and inorganic acquisitions aligned with strategic priorities. additional excess capital is returned to the company's shareholders via a combination of dividends and share repurchases.

(1)free cash flow is a non-gaap measure and is defined by the company as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for capital expenditures. refer to the section entitled "non-gaap financial measures" of this md&a for further information on this financial measure.
net cash provided by operating activities net cash flows from operating activities decreased $531 million compared to the prior year primarily reflecting:
-a decrease in operating income of $961 million (see section entitled "results of operations" of this md&a for further discussion);
-various changes in working capital;
net cash used in investing activities the $2,357 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities compared to 2021 primarily reflects:
-higher cash paid of $2,082 million in the prior year for acquisitions, primarily reflecting the acquisition of rms (refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the company's m&a activity);
-$250 million of cash paid in the prior year for a minority investment in bitsight (refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the company's investments in non-consolidated affiliates); and
-an increase in cash paid for capital additions of $144 million reflecting product development and investments relating to strategic initiatives to support business growth and to enhance technology infrastructure to enable automation, innovation and efficiency.
net cash used in financing activities the $1,086 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributed to:
table of contents cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments the company's aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.9 billion at december 31, 2022 included approximately $1.4 billion located outside of the u.s. approximately 42% of the company's aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is denominated in euros and british pounds. the company manages both its u.s. and non-u.s. cash flow to maintain sufficient liquidity in all regions to effectively meet its operating needs.
as a result of the tax act, all previously net undistributed foreign earnings have now been subject to u.s. tax. the company continues to evaluate which entities it will indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the u.s. the company has provided deferred taxes for those entities whose earnings are not considered indefinitely reinvested. accordingly, the company has commenced repatriating a portion of its non-u.s. cash in these subsidiaries and will continue to repatriate certain of its offshore cash in a manner that addresses compliance with local statutory requirements, sufficient offshore working capital and any other factors that may be relevant in certain jurisdictions. notwithstanding the tax act, which generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the u.s., cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes or withholding or similar taxes.
financing arrangements indebtedness at december 31, 2022, moody's had $7.4 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $1 billion of additional capacity available under the company's cp program, which is backstopped by the $1.25 billion 2021 facility.
future interest payments and fees associated with the company's debt and credit facility are expected to be $4.8 billion, of which approximately $316 million is expected to be paid over the next twelve months. for additional information on the company's outstanding debt, cp program and 2021 facility, refer to note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
management may consider pursuing additional long-term financing when it is appropriate in light of cash requirements for operations, share repurchases and other strategic opportunities, which would result in higher financing costs.
purchase obligations purchase obligations generally include multi-year agreements with vendors to purchase goods or services and mainly include data center/cloud hosting fees and fees for information technology licensing and maintenance. as of december 31, 2022, these purchase obligations totaled $218 million, of which $138 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months.
pension and other retirement plan obligations the company does not anticipate making significant contributions to its funded pension plan in the next twelve months. this plan is overfunded at december 31, 2022, and accordingly holds sufficient investments to fund future benefit obligations. payments for the company's unfunded plans are not expected to be material in either the short or long-term. for further information on the company's pension and other retirement plan obligations, refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
on february 9, 2021, the board approved $1 billion in share repurchase authority, and on february 7, 2022, the board approved an additional $750 million of share repurchase authority. at december 31, 2022, the company had approximately $848 million of remaining authority. there is no established expiration date for the remaining authorizations.
restructuring as more fully discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the company is currently in the process of executing the 2022 - 2023 geolocation restructuring program. this program relates to the company's post-covid-19 geolocation strategy and includes the rationalization and exit of certain real estate leases and a reduction in staff, including the relocation of certain job functions from their current locations. future cash outlays associated with this program are expected to be approximately $60 million to $80 million, which are expected to be paid through 2024.
sources of funding to satisfy material cash requirements the company believes that it has the financial resources needed to meet its cash requirements and expects to have positive operating cash flow in 2023. cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months will depend, among other things, on the company's profitability and its ability to manage working capital requirements. the company may also borrow from various sources as described above.
in addition to its reported results, moody's has included in this md&a certain adjusted results that the sec defines as "non-gaap financial measures." management believes that such adjusted financial measures, when read in conjunction with the company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the company's performance, facilitate comparisons to competitors' operating results and can provide greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. these adjusted measures, as defined by the company, are not necessarily comparable to similarly defined measures of other companies. furthermore, these adjusted measures should not be viewed in isolation or used as a substitute for other gaap measures in assessing the operating performance or cash flows of the company. below are brief descriptions of the company's adjusted financial measures accompanied by a reconciliation of the adjusted measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure.
the company presents adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on moody's operating performance. adjusted operating income excludes the impact of: i) depreciation and amortization; and ii) restructuring charges/adjustments. depreciation and amortization are excluded because companies utilize productive assets of different useful lives and use different methods of acquiring and depreciating productive assets. restructuring charges/adjustments are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these charges may vary widely across periods and companies.
management believes that the exclusion of the aforementioned items, as detailed in the reconciliation below, allows for an additional perspective on the company's operating results from period to period and across companies. the company defines adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating income divided by revenue.
the company presents adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps because management deems these metrics to be useful measures to provide additional perspective on moody's operating performance. adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps exclude the impact of: i) amortization of acquired intangible assets; ii) restructuring charges/adjustments; iii) a gain on the extinguishment of debt; iv) fx translation losses reclassified to earnings resulting from the company no longer conducting commercial operations in russia; and v) a non-cash gain relating to the company's minority investment in bitsight.
the company excludes the impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets as companies utilize intangible assets with different estimated useful lives and have different methods of acquiring and amortizing intangible assets. these intangible assets were recorded as part of acquisition accounting and contribute to revenue generation. the amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. furthermore, the timing and magnitude of business combination transactions are not predictable and the purchase price allocated to amortizable intangible assets and the related amortization period are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from period to period and across companies. restructuring charges/adjustments, the gain on extinguishment of debt, fx translation losses reclassified to earnings resulting from the company no longer conducting commercial operations in russia, and the non-cash gain relating to the company's minority interest in bitsight are excluded as the frequency and magnitude of these items may vary widely across periods and companies.
the company excludes the aforementioned items to provide additional perspective when comparing net income and diluted eps from period to period and across companies as the frequency and magnitude of similar transactions may vary widely across periods.

the company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus payments for capital additions. management believes that free cash flow is a useful metric in assessing the company's cash flows to service debt, pay dividends and to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. management deems capital expenditures essential to the company's product and service innovations and maintenance of moody's operational capabilities. accordingly, capital expenditures are deemed to be a recurring use of moody's cash flow. below is a reconciliation of the company's net cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow:

beginning in the second quarter of 2022, the company began presenting organic constant currency revenue growth (decline) and constant currency revenue growth (decline) as its non-gaap measure of revenue growth (decline). previously, the company presented organic revenue growth (decline), which excluded only the impact of certain acquisition activity. management deems this revised measure to be useful in providing additional perspective in assessing the company's revenue growth (decline) excluding both the inorganic revenue impacts from certain acquisition activity and the impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates. the company calculates the dollar impact of foreign exchange as the difference between the translation of its current period non-usd functional currency results using comparative prior period weighted average foreign exchange translation rates and current year reported results.
below is a reconciliation of the company's reported revenue and growth (decline) rates to its organic constant currency revenue growth (decline) and constant currency revenue growth (decline) measures:

the company presents annualized recurring revenue ("arr") on a constant currency organic basis for its ma business as a supplemental performance metric to provide additional insight on the estimated value of ma's recurring revenue contracts at a given point in time. the company uses arr to manage and monitor performance of its ma operating segment and believes that this metric is a key indicator of the trajectory of ma's recurring revenue base.
the company calculates arr by taking the total recurring contract value for each active renewable contract as of the reporting date, divided by the number of days in the contract and multiplied by 365 days to create an annualized value. the company defines renewable contracts as subscriptions, term licenses, maintenance and renewable services. arr excludes transaction sales including training, one-time services and perpetual licenses. in order to compare period-over-period arr excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, the company bases the calculation on currency rates utilized in its current year operating budget and holds these fx rates constant for the duration of all current and prior periods being reported. additionally, arr excludes contracts related to acquisitions to provide additional perspective in assessing growth excluding the impacts from certain acquisition activity.
the company's definition of arr may differ from definitions utilized by other companies reporting similarly named measures, and this metric should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with u.s. gaap.

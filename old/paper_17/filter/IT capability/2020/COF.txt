item 1a. risk factors this section highlights significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. in addition, the global economic and political climate may amplify many of these risks.
summary of risk factors below is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities risky. this summary does not address all of the risks that we face. additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this form 10-k and our other filings with the sec, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.

general economic and market risks the covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and financial results, and the extent to which the pandemic and measures taken in response to the pandemic could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.
global health concerns relating to the covid-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have impacted the macroeconomic environment, significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. the pandemic has also caused governmental authorities to implement numerous measures to try to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. these measures have negatively impacted and may further negatively impact consumer and business payment and spending patterns.
the covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, operations, financial condition, capital and results of operations. the extent of these impacts depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and magnitude of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, the effectiveness of economic stimulus measures in the united states, and how quickly and capital one financial corporation (cof)
to what extent economic and operating conditions and consumer and business spending can return to their pre-pandemic levels. as of december 31, 2020, several vaccines have been authorized for limited distribution. the plan for larger community-based distribution is being developed and may begin during the second quarter of 2021. however, the timing and extent of any such widespread distribution of vaccines remains uncertain. as a result of this uncertainty, our purchase volume, loan growth and the overall demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted, which could adversely affect our revenue and other results of operations. in addition, we could experience higher credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses beyond current levels. for example, as a result of the significant uncertainty due to the covid-19 pandemic, we realized a substantial build in our allowance for credit losses for the first two quarters of 2020. we could also experience impairments of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position, including possible constraints on liquidity and capital, as well as higher costs of capital. even after the covid-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business and results of operations, which could be material, as a result of the macroeconomic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.
the spread of covid-19 has caused us to modify our business practices and operations, including providing a range of forbearance options to our customers in certain circumstances, which could impact our credit metrics, financial condition, capital and results of operations. we may need to further modify our practices and operations as this event unfolds. we have also implemented work-from-home policies for a vast majority of our employees, and social distancing plans for our employees who are working from capital one facilities. nearly all of our cafés and bank branches across our network are open with increased safety precautions. we will continue to monitor local conditions to ensure the safety of our associates and customers while providing critical banking services. these measures could impair our ability to perform critical functions and may adversely impact our results of operations. in addition, these measures and other changes in consumer behavior as a result of the covid-19 pandemic may require changes to retail distribution strategies and adversely impact our investments in our bank premises and equipment and other retail distribution assets, leading to increased costs and exposure to additional risks. we may take further actions as required by government authorities or that we otherwise determine are in the best interests of our customers, employees and business partners.
federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities have enacted, and may enact in the future, legislation, regulations and protocols in response to the covid-19 pandemic, including governmental programs intended to provide economic relief to businesses and individuals. we have participated in certain of these programs, including participating as an eligible lender in the small business administration's paycheck protection program. our participation in and execution of any such programs may cause operational, compliance, reputational and credit risks, which could result in litigation, governmental action or other forms of loss. the extent of these impacts, which may be substantial, will depend on the degree of our participation in these programs. there remains significant uncertainty regarding the measures that authorities will enact in the future and the ultimate impact of the legislation, regulations and protocols that have been and will be enacted. moreover, we expect that the effects of the covid-19 pandemic will heighten many of the other known risks described herein. see part i-item 1.-business-overview-coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic.
changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment, consumer confidence and customer behavior may adversely affect our business.
we offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. a prolonged period of economic volatility, slow growth, or a significant deterioration in economic conditions, in the u.s., canada or the u.k., could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers default on their loans, maintain lower deposit levels or, in the case of credit card accounts, carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity.
some of the risks we face in connection with adverse changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment, including changes in consumer confidence levels and behavior, include the following:
•changes in payment patterns, increases in delinquencies and default rates, decreased consumer spending, lower demand for credit and shifts in consumer payment behavior towards avoiding late fees, finance charges and other fees;
•increases in our charge-off rate caused by bankruptcies and reduced ability to recover debt that we have previously charged-off;
•decreased reliability of the process and models we use to estimate our allowance for loan and lease losses, particularly if unexpected variations in key inputs and assumptions cause actual losses to diverge from the projections of our models capital one financial corporation (cof)
the u.k. and the european union agreed to a free trade deal at the end of 2020 relating to the u.k.'s exit from the european union ("brexit"). while this deal provides greater near-term stability, the on-going impact of brexit and its full effects on the u.k. economy and our business related thereto remain uncertain. we continue to consider and monitor the potential impacts, and other factors, including the covid-19 pandemic, that could also impact u.k. economic performance.
financial market instability and volatility could adversely affect our business.
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, which could limit our access to funding. in addition, fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads and other market factors could negatively impact our results of operations. both shorter-term and longer-term interest rates remain below long-term historical averages and the yield curve has been relatively flat compared to past periods. a flat yield curve combined with low interest rates generally leads to lower revenue and reduced margins because it tends to limit our ability to increase the spread between asset yields and funding costs. sustained periods of time with a flat yield curve coupled with low interest rates, or an inversion of the yield curve, could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin and earnings.
in response to the economic consequences of the covid-19 pandemic, the federal reserve lowered its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%. such low rates increase the risk in the u.s. of a negative interest rate environment in which interest rates drop below zero, either broadly or for some types of instruments. for example, yields on one-month and three-month treasuries briefly dropped below zero in march 2020. such an occurrence would likely further reduce the interest we earn on loans and other interest-earning assets, while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the federal reserve. our systems may not be able to handle adequately a negative interest rate environment and not all variable rate instruments are designed for such a circumstance. we cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies in response to the covid-19 pandemic or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results.
credit risk we may experience increased delinquencies, credit losses, inaccurate estimates and inadequate reserves.
like other lenders, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans. a customer's ability and willingness to repay us can be adversely affected by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders, whether as a result of higher debt levels or rising interest rates, by restricted availability of credit generally, or by the revenue and income of the borrower. we may fail to quickly identify and reduce our exposure to customers that are likely to default on their payment obligations, whether by closing credit lines or restricting authorizations. our ability to manage credit risk also is affected by legal or regulatory changes (such as restrictions on collections, bankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations and re-age guidance), competitors' actions and consumer behavior, and depends on the effectiveness of our collections staff, techniques and models.
rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses (such as higher delinquencies, higher rates of nonperforming loans, higher bankruptcy rates, lower collateral values, elevated unemployment rates or changing market terms) may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses, which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses. in particular, we face the following risks in this area:
•missed payments: our customers may miss payments. loan charge-offs (including from bankruptcies) are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition for our customers. historically, customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn or prolonged periods of slow economic growth. in addition, we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change (for example, an increase in the unwillingness or inability of customers to repay debt, which may be heightened by increasing interest rates or levels of consumer debt), causing a long-term rise in delinquencies and charge-offs.
•incorrect estimates of expected losses: the credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. we allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of expected credit losses in our loan portfolios. this process, which is critical to our financial condition and results of operations, requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions. we may underestimate our expected losses and fail to hold an allowance for credit losses sufficient to account for these losses. incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimations of expected credit losses and an inadequate allowance for credit losses.
capital one financial corporation (cof)
•inaccurate underwriting: our ability to accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers may diminish, which could result in an increase in our credit losses and a deterioration of our returns. see "our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk."
•business mix: we engage in a diverse mix of businesses with a broad range of potential credit exposure. because we originate a relatively greater proportion of consumer loans in our loan portfolio compared to other large bank peers and originate both prime and subprime credit card accounts and auto loans, we may experience higher delinquencies and a greater number of accounts charging off compared to other large bank peers, which could result in increased credit losses, operating costs and regulatory scrutiny. additionally, a change in this business mix over time to include proportionally more consumer loans or subprime credit card accounts or auto loans could adversely affect the credit quality of our portfolio.
•increasing charge-off recognition/allowance for credit losses: we account for the allowance for credit losses according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules, including financial accounting standards board ("fasb") standards and the federal financial institutions examination council ("ffiec") account management guidance. effective as of january 1, 2020, we adopted the cecl standard which is based on expected lifetime losses rather than incurred losses. adoption of the cecl standard has resulted and may continue to result in an increase to our reserves for credit losses on financial instruments with a resulting adverse impact on our financial condition. the continued impact of cecl on our future results will depend on the characteristics of our financial instruments, economic conditions, and our economic and loss forecasts. the application of the cecl standard requires us to increase reserves faster and to a higher level in an economic downturn, resulting in greater impact to our results and our capital ratios than we would have experienced in similar circumstances prior to the adoption of cecl. in addition, because credit cards represent a significant portion of our product mix, we could be disproportionately affected by use of the cecl standard, as compared to our large bank peers with a different product mix. see "md&a-accounting changes and developments" for additional information.
•insufficient asset values: the collateral we have on secured loans could be insufficient to compensate us for credit losses. when customers default on their secured loans, we attempt to recover collateral where permissible and appropriate. however, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers. decreases in real estate and other asset values adversely affect the collateral value for our commercial lending activities, while the auto business is similarly exposed to collateral risks arising from the auction markets that determine used car prices. borrowers may be less likely to continue making payments on loans if the value of the property used as collateral for the loan is less than what the borrower owes, even if the borrower is still financially able to make the payments. in that circumstance, the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans upon a default. in our auto business, business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes, housing prices and consumer behavior, as well as technological advances that make older cars obsolete faster, could decrease (i) the demand for new and used vehicles and (ii) the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of auto loans, which could cause the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans to increase.
•geographic and industry concentration: although our consumer lending is geographically diversified, approximately 27% of our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the tri-state area of new york, new jersey and connecticut. the regional economic conditions in the tri-state area affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. an economic downturn or prolonged period of slow economic growth in, or a catastrophic event that disproportionately affects, the tri-state area could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our results of operations. in addition, our commercial banking strategy includes an industry-specific focus. if any of the industries that we focus on experience changes, we may experience increased credit losses and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. for example, as of december 31, 2020, healthcare and healthcare-related real estate loans represented approximately 19% of our total commercial loan portfolio. if healthcare-related industries or any of the other industries that we focus on experience adverse changes, we may experience increased credit losses and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

capital and liquidity risk we may not be able to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels, which could have a negative impact on our financial results and our ability to return capital to our stockholders.
financial institutions are subject to extensive and complex capital and liquidity requirements. these requirements affect our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions and make most capital distributions. failure to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels, whether due to adverse developments in our business or the economy or to changes in the applicable requirements, could subject us to a variety of remedies available to our regulators. these include limitations on the ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares and the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital. such limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we consider various factors in the management of capital, including the impact of stress on our capital levels, as determined by both our internal modeling and the federal reserve's modeling of our capital position in supervisory stress tests and ccar. there can be significant differences between our modeling and the federal reserve's estimates for a given scenario and between the capital needs suggested by our internal bank holding company scenarios relative to the supervisory scenarios. therefore, although our estimated capital levels under stress disclosed as part of the ccar or dfast processes may suggest that we have substantial capacity to return capital to stockholders and remain well capitalized under stress, the federal reserve's modeling, our internal modeling of another scenario or other factors related to our capital management process may result in a materially lower capacity to return capital to stockholders than that indicated by the projections released in the ccar or dfast processes. this in turn, could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchase transactions. see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation" for additional information.
in addition, the current capital and liquidity requirements are subject to change. the federal banking agencies finalized the tailoring rule in the fourth quarter of 2019. under the tailoring rule, we are a category iii institution, and are no longer subject to the basel iii advanced approaches and associated capital requirements, but we continue to be subject to the countercyclical capital buffer and supplementary leverage ratio. in march 2020, the federal reserve issued a final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement. this final rule became effective in may 2020. pursuant to the stress capital buffer rule, the federal reserve will use the results of its supervisory stress test to determine the size of a large banking institution's stress capital buffer requirement, which replaces the previous 2.5% capital conservation buffer under the basel iii standardized approach. our stress capital buffer requirement is 5.6% for the period from october 1, 2020 through september 30, 2021, at which point a revised stress capital buffer requirement will be applicable to us based on our 2021 stress testing results. in addition, on june 25, 2020 the federal reserve introduced measures to ensure that large bhcs maintained a high level of capital resilience. specifically, the federal reserve required certain large bhcs, including us, to suspend share repurchases and cap common dividends during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. consistent with the federal reserve's capital distribution restrictions, we reduced our quarterly dividend on our common stock from $0.40 per share to $0.10 per share for the third quarter of 2020, which we maintained into the fourth quarter of 2020. the federal banking agencies also finalized rules to implement the nsfr in october 2020. the nsfr is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities and its requirements will become effective as of july 1, 2021. on december 18, 2020, the federal reserve extended the capital distribution restrictions for all participating bhcs to the first quarter of 2021, with certain modifications. in particular, for the first quarter of 2021, participating bhcs may resume share repurchases however the aggregate amount of dividend payments and share repurchases will be limited to an amount based on net income earned in the preceding four calendar quarters. see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation" for additional information. further changes to applicable capital and liquidity requirements could result in unexpected or new limitations on our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchases.
our ability to retain and attract customers depends on our ability to develop, operate, and adapt our technology and organizational infrastructure in a rapidly changing environment. in addition, we must accurately process, record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions. digital technology, data and software development are deeply embedded into our business model and how we work.
similar to other large corporations, we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors in execution, inadequate processes, inaccurate models, faulty or disabled technological infrastructure, and fraud by employees or capital one financial corporation (cof)
persons outside of our company. in addition, we are heavily dependent on the security, capability and continuous availability of the technology systems that we use to manage our internal financial and other systems, monitor risk and compliance with regulatory requirements, provide services to our customers, develop and offer new products and communicate with stakeholders. we also face risk of adverse customer impacts and business disruption arising from the execution of strategic initiatives we may pursue across our operations.
if we do not maintain the necessary operational, technological and organizational infrastructure to operate our business, including to maintain the security of that infrastructure, our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected. we also are subject to disruptions to our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages, design flaws in foundational components or platforms, availability and quality of vulnerability patches from key vendors, cyber-attacks (including distributed denial of service ("ddos") and other attacks on our infrastructure as discussed below), natural disasters, other damage to property or physical assets, or events arising from local or larger scale politics, including terrorist acts. any failure to maintain our infrastructure or disruption of our operating systems and applications could diminish our ability to operate our businesses, service customer accounts and protect customers' information, or result in potential liability to customers, reputational damage, regulatory intervention and customers' loss of confidence in our businesses, any of which could result in a material adverse effect.
we also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with which we do business and to whom we outsource the operation, maintenance and development of our information technology and communications systems. we have migrated substantially all, and intend to migrate all, of our core information technology systems and customer-facing applications to third-party cloud infrastructure platforms, principally aws. if we do not complete the transition or fail to administer these new environments in a well-managed, secure and effective manner, or if aws platforms become unavailable or do not meet their service level agreements for any reason, we may experience unplanned service disruption or unforeseen costs which could result in material harm to our business and results of operations. we must successfully develop and maintain information, financial reporting, disclosure, data-protection and other controls adapted to our reliance on outside platforms and providers. in addition, aws, or other service providers, could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyber-attacks, adverse changes to financial condition, bankruptcy, or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. thus, the substantial amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to aws or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure.
any disruptions, failures or inaccuracies of our operational and technology systems and models, including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems and models, could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services, manage our risk, meet our regulatory obligations or report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner, all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. in addition, our ongoing investments in infrastructure, which are necessary to maintain a competitive business, integrate acquisitions and establish scalable operations, may increase our expenses. as our business develops, changes or expands, additional expenses can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies, management of outsourced services, asset purchases or other acquisitions, structural reorganization, compliance with new laws or regulations, or the integration of newly acquired businesses, or the prevention or occurrence of data security incidents. if we are unable to successfully manage our expenses, our financial results will be negatively affected. changes to our business, including as a result of our strategic objectives, also requires robust governance to ensure that our objectives are executed as intended without adversely impacting our customers, associates, operations or financial performance. ineffective change management oversight and governance over the execution of our strategic objectives could expose us to operational, strategic and reputational risk and could negatively impact customers or our financial performance.
our products and services involve the gathering, authenticating, managing, processing, and the storing and transmission of sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers and their accounts, our employees and third parties with which we do business. our ability to provide such products and services, many of which are web-based, depends upon the management and safeguarding of information, software, methodologies and business secrets. to provide these products and services to, as well as communicate with, our customers, we rely on information systems and infrastructure, including software and data engineering, and information security personnel, digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, networks and other web-based technologies. we also have arrangements in place with third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers.
capital one financial corporation (cof)
technologies, systems, networks and devices of capital one or our employees, service providers or other third parties with whom we interact may continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access, mishandling or misuse of information, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, website defacement, hacking, malware, ransomware, phishing or other forms of social engineering, and other forms of cyber-attacks designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, and other events. these threats, such as the cybersecurity incident, may derive from error, fraud or malice on the part of our employees, insiders or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure. any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other third-party users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or third parties with whom we interact, or to unlawfully obtain monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. further, cyber and information security risks for large financial institutions like us continue to increase due to the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, activists, formal and informal instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties. in addition, our customers access our products and services using computers, smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.
the methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack, disable, degrade or sabotage platforms, systems and applications change frequently, are increasingly sophisticated and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have occurred, and some techniques could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. for example, although we immediately fixed the configuration vulnerability that was exploited in the cybersecurity incident once we discovered the unauthorized access, a period of time elapsed between the occurrence of the unauthorized access and the time when we discovered it. in other circumstances, we and our third-party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate or identify certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures or mitigate or remediate the damages caused in a timely manner. we may also be unable to hire and develop talent capable of detecting, mitigating or remediating these risks. although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls, including our cyber threat analytics, data encryption and tokenization technologies, anti-malware defenses and vulnerability management program, any one or combination of these controls could fail to detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner. we will likely face an increasing number of attempted cyber-attacks as we expand our mobile and other internet-based products and services, as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of retail clients.
a disruption or breach, including as a result of a cyber-attack such as the cybersecurity incident, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at capital one or at our third-party service providers, could result in significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory intervention, litigation and remediation costs, card reissuance, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services that could adversely affect our business. we and other u.s. financial services providers continue to be targeted with evolving and adaptive cybersecurity threats from sophisticated third parties. we are continuing to assess the impact of the cybersecurity incident and there can be no assurance that additional unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur or that we will not suffer material losses in the future. unauthorized access or cybersecurity incidents could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale. if future attacks like these are successful or if customers are unable to access their accounts online for other reasons, it could adversely impact our ability to service customer accounts or loans, complete financial transactions for our customers or otherwise operate any of our businesses or services. in addition, a breach or attack affecting one of our third-party service providers or partners could harm our business even if we do not control the service that is attacked.
in addition, the increasing prevalence and the evolution of cyber-attacks and other efforts to breach or disrupt our systems or those of our partners, retailers or other market participants has led, and will likely continue to lead, to increased costs to us with respect to preventing, mitigating and remediating these risks, as well as any related attempted fraud. in order to address ongoing and future risks, including from the cybersecurity incident, we must expend significant resources to support protective security measures, investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities of our information systems and infrastructure and invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks. the cybersecurity incident, or successful cyber-attacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants (whether or not we are impacted), could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our financial products. we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, including insurance that is expected to cover certain costs associated with the cybersecurity incident; nonetheless, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event, and such insurance may increase in cost or cease to be available on commercial terms in the future.

potential data protection and privacy incidents, and our required compliance with regulations related to these areas, may increase our costs, reduce our revenue and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.
a breach, failure or other disruption of our information systems or infrastructure or data management processes, or those of our customers, partners, service providers or other market participants, could lead, depending on the nature of the incident, to the unauthorized or unintended access to and release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of personal or confidential data about our customers, employees or other third parties in our possession. any party that obtains this personal or confidential data through a breach or disruption may use this information for ransom, to be paid by us or a third-party, as part of a fraudulent activity that is part of a broader criminal activity, or for other illicit purposes. further, such disruption or breach could also result in unauthorized access to our proprietary information, intellectual property, software, methodologies and business secrets and in unauthorized transactions in capital one accounts or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information maintained by those entities. there has been a significant proliferation of consumer information available on the internet resulting from breaches of third-party entities, including personal information, log-in credentials and authentication data. while we were not directly involved in these third-party breach events, the stolen information can create a vulnerability for our customers if their capital one log-in credentials are the same as or similar to the credentials that have been compromised on other sites. this vulnerability could include the risk of unauthorized account access, data loss and fraud. the use of artificial intelligence, "bots" or other automation software, can increase the velocity and efficacy of these types of attacks.
we are continuing to assess the impact of the cybersecurity incident. the cybersecurity incident, other data security incidents we may experience in the future, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at capital one or at third-party service providers, could result in significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory intervention, remediation costs, card reissuance, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services that could adversely affect our business.
we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. for example, in canada we are subject to the personal information protection and electronic documents act ("pipeda"). in addition, the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") applies eu data protection law to all companies processing data of eu residents, regardless of the company's location. more recently, on january 1, 2020, the ccpa went into effect for companies doing business in california. these laws impose strict requirements regarding the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data, which may have adverse consequences, including severe monetary penalties. our efforts to comply with pipeda, gdpr, ccpa and other privacy and data protection laws entail substantial expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer. furthermore, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. the enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, regulations, or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in monetary or other penalties and significant legal liability.
we rely on quantitative models, and our ability to manage data and aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner, assess and manage our various risk exposures, estimate certain financial values and manage compliance with required regulatory capital requirements. models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting deposit levels or loan losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items, and other operational functions. our risk reporting and management, including business decisions based on information incorporating models, depend on the effectiveness of our models and our policies, programs, processes and practices governing how data is acquired, validated, stored, protected, processed and analyzed. any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, formulas or algorithms, could result in inaccurate forecasts, ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting. in addition, models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time. while we continuously update our policies, programs, processes and practices, many of our data management, aggregation and implementation processes are manual and subject to human error or system failure. failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to capital one financial corporation (cof)
manage current and emerging risk, to produce accurate financial, regulatory and operational reporting as well as to manage changing business needs. if our risk management framework is ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition. also, any information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distribution to our stockholders, could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.
legal and regulatory risk compliance with new and existing laws, regulations and regulatory expectations is costly and complex.
we are subject to extensive regulatory oversight by the federal banking regulators to ensure that we build systems and processes that are commensurate with the nature of our business and that meet the risk management and prudential standards issued by our regulators. a wide array of banking and consumer lending laws apply to almost every aspect of our business. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including significant fines and criminal sanctions, and/or damage to our reputation with regulators, our customers or the public. hiring, training and retaining qualified compliance and legal personnel, and establishing and maintaining compliance-related systems, infrastructure and processes, is difficult and these efforts could limit our ability to invest in other business opportunities. furthermore, applicable rules and regulations may affect us in an unforeseen manner, or may have a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors. over the last several years, state and federal regulators have focused on compliance with the bank secrecy act and anti-money laundering ("aml") laws, data integrity and security, use of service providers, fair lending and other consumer protection issues. for example, in july 2015, capital one entered into a consent order with the occ to address concerns about our aml program and in october 2018, capital one paid a civil monetary penalty assessed by the occ relating to our aml program. the occ lifted the aml consent order in november 2019. in addition, in august 2020 we entered into consent orders with the federal reserve and the occ resulting from regulatory reviews of the cybersecurity incident and relating to ongoing enhancements of our cybersecurity and operational risk management processes, and we paid a civil monetary penalty as part of the occ agreement. in january 2021, we also paid a civil monetary penalty assessed by the financial crimes enforcement network ("fincen") against cona in connection with our aml program. failure to maintain compliance with laws and regulations could result in significant additional governmental fines or penalties.
we have a large number of customer accounts in our credit card and auto lending businesses and we have made the strategic choice to originate and service subprime credit card and auto loans, which typically have higher delinquencies and charge-offs than prime customers. as a result, we have significant involvement with credit bureau reporting and the collection and recovery of delinquent and charged-off debt, primarily through customer communications, the filing of litigation against customers in default, the periodic sale of charged-off debt and vehicle repossession. these activities are subject to enhanced legal and regulatory scrutiny from regulators, courts and legislators. any future changes to our business practices in these areas, including our debt collection practices, whether mandated by regulators, courts, legislators or otherwise, or any legal liabilities resulting from our business practices, including our debt collection practices, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
the legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue, costs, earnings, growth, liquidity and capital levels. in addition, some rules and regulations may be subject to litigation or other challenges that delay or modify their implementation and impact on us. adoption of new technologies, such as distributed ledger technologies, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, can present unforeseen challenges in applying and relying on existing compliance systems.
certain laws and regulations, and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto, are generally intended to protect consumers, borrowers, depositors, the dif, the u.s. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole, but not stockholders. our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations. for a description of the material laws and regulations to which we are subject, see "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation."
our businesses are subject to the risk of increased litigation, government investigations and regulatory enforcement.
our businesses are subject to increased litigation, government investigations and other regulatory enforcement risks as a result of a number of factors and from various sources, including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry, the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry.
capital one financial corporation (cof)
given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation, government investigations and regulatory enforcement decisions, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us, there can be significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these kinds of matters. the finding, or even the assertion, of substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and could cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business. the cybersecurity incident has resulted in litigation, government investigations and other regulatory enforcement inquiries.
in addition, financial institutions, such as ourselves, face significant regulatory scrutiny, which can lead to public enforcement actions or non-public supervisory actions. we and our subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by, among other regulatory bodies, the federal reserve, the sec, occ, fdic and cfpb. we have been subject to enforcement actions by many of these and other regulators and may continue to be involved in such actions, including governmental inquiries, investigations and enforcement proceedings, including by the occ, department of justice, fincen and state attorneys general.
we expect that regulators and governmental enforcement bodies will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through non-public supervisory actions or findings, which could involve restrictions on our activities, or our ability to make acquisitions or otherwise expand our business, among other limitations that could adversely affect our business. in addition, a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution is likely to give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us. furthermore, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings. these and other initiatives from governmental authorities and officials may subject us to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause us to restructure our operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm our reputation or lead to higher operational costs. litigation, government investigations and other regulatory actions could involve restrictions on our activities, generally subject us to significant fines, increased expenses, restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation and our brand, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. for additional information regarding legal and regulatory proceedings that we are subject to, see "note 18-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
other business risks we face intense competition in all of our markets.
we operate in a highly competitive environment, whether in making loans, attracting deposits or in the global payments industry, and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify with respect to most of our products. we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits and the rates and other terms we charge on the loans we originate or purchase, as well as the quality and range of our customer service, products, innovation and experience. this increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in technology, product delivery systems and regulation, as well as the emergence of new or significantly larger financial services providers, all of which may affect our customers' expectations and demands. in addition to offering competitive products and services, we invest in and conduct marketing campaigns to attract and inform customers.
some of our competitors, including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space and other financial technology providers, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject, which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage, in particular in the development of new technology platforms or the ability to rapidly innovate. we compete with many forms of payments offered by both bank and non-bank providers, including a variety of new and evolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products, such as aggregators and web-based and wireless payment platforms or technologies, digital or "crypto" currencies, prepaid systems and payment services targeting users of social networks, communications platforms and online gaming. if we are unable to continue to keep pace with innovation, do not effectively market our products and services or are prohibited from or unwilling to enter emerging areas of competition, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, which may give those competitors advantages, including a more diversified product and customer base, the ability to reach more customers and potential customers, operational efficiencies, broad-based local distribution capabilities, lower-cost funding and larger existing branch networks. many of our competitors are also focusing on cross-selling their products and developing new products or technologies, which could affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationships or require us to offer lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or higher interest rates on deposits. competition for loans could result in origination of fewer loans, earning less on our loans or an increase in loans that perform below expectations.
capital one financial corporation (cof)
as of december 31, 2020, we operate as one of the largest online direct banks in the united states by deposits. while direct banking provides a significant opportunity to attract new customers that value greater and more flexible access to banking services at reduced costs, we face strong and increasing competition in the direct banking market. aggressive pricing throughout the industry may adversely affect the retention of existing balances and the cost-efficient acquisition of new deposit funds and may affect our growth and profitability. customers could also close their online accounts or reduce balances or deposits in favor of products and services offered by competitors for other reasons. these shifts, which could be rapid, could result from general dissatisfaction with our products or services, including concerns over pricing, online security or our reputation. the potential consequences of this competitive environment are exacerbated by the flexibility of direct banking and the financial and technological sophistication of our online customer base.
in our credit card business, competition for rewards customers may result in higher rewards expenses, or we may fail to attract new customers or retain existing rewards customers due to increasing competition for these consumers. as of december 31, 2020, we have a number of large partnerships in our credit card loan portfolio. the market for key business partners, especially in the credit card business, is very competitive, and we may not be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships. we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources into acquiring and developing the relationships. the loss of any of our key business partners could have a negative impact on our results of operations, including lower returns, excess operating expense and excess funding capacity.
we depend on our partners to effectively promote our cobrand and private label products and integrate the use of our credit cards into their retail operations. the failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models could adversely affect card usage and our ability to achieve the growth and profitability objectives of our partnerships. in addition, if our partners do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements and standards, or otherwise diminish the value of our brand, we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products.
some of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising, marketing or cross-selling strategies to acquire and retain more customers, capture a greater share of spending and borrowings, attain and develop more attractive cobrand card programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have. we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors.
in such a competitive environment, we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing firms, or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base. customer attrition from any or all of our lending products, together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers, could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings. similarly, unexpected customer attrition from our deposit products, in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain deposits, may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings.
our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants' increasing focus on the fees charged by credit card networks and by legislation and regulation impacting such fees.
credit card interchange fees are generally one of the largest components of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of credit cards and are a meaningful source of revenue for our credit card businesses. interchange fees are the subject of significant and intense global legal, legislative and regulatory focus, and the resulting decisions, legislation and regulation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.
legislative and regulatory bodies in a number of countries are seeking to reduce credit card interchange fees through legislation, competition-related regulatory proceedings, central bank regulation and or litigation. interchange reimbursement rates in the united states are set by credit card networks such as mastercard and visa. in some jurisdictions, such as canada and certain countries in the eu, interchange fees and related practices are subject to regulatory activity that has limited the ability of certain networks to establish default rates, including in some cases imposing caps on permissible interchange fees. we have already experienced these impacts in our international card businesses. legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each other's approaches to the regulation of the payments industry. consequently, a development in one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another, such as our primary market, the united states.
in addition to this regulatory activity, merchants are also seeking avenues to reduce interchange fees. during the past few years, merchants and their trade groups have filed numerous lawsuits against visa, mastercard, american express and their card-
capital one financial corporation (cof)
issuing banks, claiming that their practices toward merchants, including interchange and similar fees, violate federal antitrust laws. in 2005, a number of entities filed antitrust lawsuits against mastercard and visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us, alleging among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. in december 2013, the u.s. district court for the eastern district of new york granted final approval of the proposed class settlement. the settlement provided, among other things, that merchants would be entitled to join together to negotiate lower interchange fees. the settlement was appealed to the second circuit court of appeals, which rejected the settlement in june 2016; a revised settlement was reached in the second half of 2018, and the trial court issued its final approval of the settlement in december 2019. see "note 18-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others" for further details.
some major retailers may have sufficient bargaining power to independently negotiate lower interchange fees with mastercard and visa, which could, in turn, result in lower interchange fees for us when our cardholders undertake purchase transactions with these retailers. in 2016, some of the largest merchants individually negotiated lower interchange rates with mastercard and/or visa. these and other merchants also continue to lobby aggressively for caps and restrictions on interchange fees and their efforts may be successful or they may in the future bring legal proceedings against us or other credit card and debit card issuers and networks.
beyond pursuing litigation, legislation and regulation, merchants may also promote forms of payment with lower fees, such as ach-based payments, or seek to impose surcharges at the point of sale for use of credit or debit cards. new payment systems, particularly mobile-based payment technologies, could also gain widespread adoption and lead to issuer transaction fees or the displacement of credit card accounts as a payment method.
the heightened focus by merchants and legislative and regulatory bodies on the fees charged by credit and debit card networks, and the ability of certain merchants to successfully negotiate discounts to interchange fees with mastercard and visa or develop alternative payment systems, could result in a reduction of interchange fees. any resulting loss in income to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if we are not able to invest successfully in and introduce digital and other technological developments across all our businesses, our financial performance may suffer.
our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes and our ability to meet our customers' needs and expectations is key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings. we expect digital technologies to have a significant impact on banking over time. consumers expect robust digital experiences from their financial services providers. the ability for customers to access their accounts and conduct financial transactions using digital technology, including mobile applications, is an important aspect of the financial services industry and financial institutions are rapidly introducing new digital and other technology-driven products and services that aim to offer a better customer experience and to reduce costs. we continue to invest in digital technology designed to attract new customers, facilitate the ability of existing customers to conduct financial transactions and enhance the customer experience related to our products and services.
our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using digital technology to provide products and services that meet their expectations. the development and launch of new digital products and services depends in large part on our capacity to invest in and build the technology platforms that can enable them, in a cost effective and timely manner. see "we face intense competition in all of our markets" and "we face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure."
some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, which may allow those competitors to invest more money into their technology infrastructure and digital innovation than we do. in addition, we face intense competition from smaller companies which experience lower cost structures and different regulatory requirements and scrutiny than we do, and which may allow them to innovate more rapidly than we can. see "we face intense competition in all of our markets." further, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain strong digital and technology leaders, engineers and other specialized personnel. the competition is intense, and the compensation costs continue to increase for such talent. if we are unable to attract and retain digital and technology talent, our ability to offer digital products and services and build the necessary technology infrastructure could be negatively affected, which could negatively impact our business and financial results. a failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to digital products and services, whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not implemented in a timely or successful manner, could negatively impact our business and financial results.

we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships.
we have engaged in merger and acquisition activity and entered into strategic partnerships over the past several years. we continue to evaluate and anticipate engaging in, among other merger and acquisition activity, additional strategic partnerships and selected acquisitions of financial institutions and other acquisition targets, including credit card and other loan portfolios. we may not be able to identify and secure future acquisition targets on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us, or successfully complete within the anticipated time frame and achieve the anticipated benefits of proposed mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships, which could impair our growth.
any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership we undertake entails certain risks, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. if we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations, or are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership, including cost savings and other synergies, our business could be negatively affected. in addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees, errors or delays in systems implementation, exposure to cybersecurity risks associated with acquired businesses, exposure to additional regulatory oversight, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with partners, clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership. integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources. these integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period.
in addition, we may face the following risks in connection with any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership:
•new businesses and geographic or other markets: our merger, acquisition or strategic partnership activity may involve our entry into new businesses and new geographic areas or other markets which present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new businesses or markets. these new businesses or markets may change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and alter our exposure to economic and other external factors. we face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses or in these new markets.
•identification and assessment of merger and acquisition targets and deployment of acquired assets: we may not be able to identify, acquire or partner with suitable targets. further, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership will depend on our ability to assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we partner with, merge with or acquire. we may be unable to profitably deploy any assets we acquire.
•accuracy of assumptions: in connection with any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership, we may make certain assumptions relating to the proposed merger, acquisition or strategic partnership that may be, or may prove to be, inaccurate, including as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership. the inaccuracy of any assumptions we may make could result in unanticipated consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
•target-specific risk: assets and companies that we acquire, or companies that we enter into strategic partnerships with, will have their own risks that are specific to a particular asset or company. these risks include, but are not limited to, particular or specific regulatory, accounting, operational, reputational and industry risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. for example, we may face challenges associated with integrating other companies due to differences in corporate culture, compliance systems or standards of conduct. indemnification rights, if any, may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses or damages resulting from such risks. in addition to regulatory approvals discussed below, certain of our merger, acquisition or partnership activity may require third-party consents in order for us to fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction.
•conditions to regulatory approval: certain acquisitions may not be consummated without obtaining approvals from one or more of our regulators. we cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. consequently, we might be required to sell portions of acquired assets or our own assets as a condition to receiving regulatory approval or we may not obtain regulatory approval for a proposed acquisition on acceptable terms or at all, in which case we would not be able to complete the acquisition despite the time and expenses invested in pursuing it.

our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our products, services, trustworthiness, business practices, workplace culture, compliance practices or our financial health. in addition, our brand is very important to us. maintaining and enhancing our brand depends largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality products and services. adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer, commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. in particular, negative public perceptions regarding our reputation, including negative perceptions regarding our ability to maintain the security of our technology systems and protect customer data, could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that consumer and commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us or significantly increase the costs of attracting and retaining customers. in addition, negative perceptions regarding certain industries, partners or clients could also prompt us to cease business activities associated with those entities.
negative public opinion or damage to our brand could also result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, security breaches (including the use and protection of customer information, such as resulting from the cybersecurity incident), corporate governance and sales and marketing, and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct. such conduct could fall short of our customers' and the public's heightened expectations of companies of our size with rigorous data, privacy and compliance practices, and could further harm our reputation. in addition, our cobrand and private label partners or other third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us or the financial services industry. the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the events discussed above will impact our reputation and business.
in addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by account holders and borrowers domestically and internationally. these social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, the public's perception regarding the banking industry and consumer debt, including credit card use, and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy. if consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt, or if consumption trends decline or if we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, or we incur significant expenses to do so, our business and financial results could be materially and negatively affected.
if we are not able to protect our intellectual property, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.
we rely on a variety of measures to protect and enhance our intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on disclosure, solicitation and competition. we also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information. these measures may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. in addition, our competitors or other third parties may file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry or allege that our systems, processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. if our competitors or other third parties are successful in obtaining such patents or prevail in intellectual property-related litigation against us, we could lose significant revenues, incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses, or pay significant damages.
our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk.
management of market, credit, liquidity, operational and compliance risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events. see "md&a-risk management" for further details. even though we continue to devote significant resources to developing our risk management framework, our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated.
some of our methods of managing these risks are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management's judgment. these methods may not accurately predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate and market conditions, particularly during a period of financial market stress, can involve unprecedented dislocations. credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from, among other things, extending credit to customers. our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge-offs due, for example, to rapid changes in the economy, including rapid changes in tariff rates and international trade relations.
capital one financial corporation (cof)
while we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes. for example, our ability to implement our risk management strategies may be hindered by adverse changes in the volatility or liquidity conditions in certain markets and as a result, may limit our ability to distribute such risks (for instance, when we seek to syndicate exposure in bridge financing transactions we have underwritten). we may, therefore, incur losses in the course of our risk management or investing activities.
fluctuations in market interest rates or volatility in the capital markets could adversely affect our income and expense, the value of assets and obligations, our regulatory capital, cost of capital or liquidity.
like other financial institutions, our business is sensitive to market interest rate movements and the performance of the capital markets. disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the capital markets could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to the funding required to operate and grow our business. in addition, changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us. for example, we borrow money from other institutions and depositors, which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other interest-earning assets. we earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and depositors. the interest rates that we pay on the securities we have issued are also influenced by, among other things, applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies. a downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations. increased charge-offs, rising libor or other applicable reference rates and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources. fluctuations in interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term rates and long-term rates and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate, may have negative impacts on our net interest income and therefore our earnings.
in addition, interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may affect the rate of customer prepayments for auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards. for example, increases in interest rates increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers, which may adversely affect those borrowers' ability to pay as contractually obligated. this could result in additional delinquencies or charge-offs and negatively impact our results of operations. these changes can reduce the overall yield on our interest-earning asset portfolio. changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us. an inability to attract or maintain deposits could materially affect our ability to fund our business and our liquidity position. many other financial institutions have increased their reliance on deposit funding and, as such, we expect continued competition in the deposit markets. we cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs. if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio. such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing.
we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings, economic value and capital under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes. we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments. we face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed. see "md&a-market risk profile" for additional information.
uncertainty regarding, and transition away from, libor may adversely affect our business.
the u.k. fca, which regulates libor, has announced that it will no longer compel banks to contribute data for the calculation of libor after december 31, 2021. it is likely that banks will no longer continue to contribute submissions for the calculation of libor after that date, which creates significant uncertainty around the publication of libor beyond 2021 and whether libor will continue to be viewed as a reliable market benchmark. in november 2020, the ice benchmark administration (iba), the administrator of libor, announced that it will consult on its intention to cease publication of the 1-week and 2-month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31, 2021, and the remaining usd libor tenors (overnight, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) immediately following the libor publication on june 30, 2023. the consultation closed on january 25, 2021 and we will continue to engage with industry experts to better understand the proposed iba's extension announcement and its impact on the markets and our transition plans. it remains unclear what rate or rates may develop as accepted alternatives to libor, or what the effect of such changes will be on the markets for libor-based financial instruments. the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") has been recommended by the alternative capital one financial corporation (cof)
reference rates committee as an alternative for usd libor, but issues and uncertainty remain with respect to its implementation.
given libor's extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from libor presents several risks and challenges to the financial markets and financial institutions, including capital one. we have loans, derivative contracts, unsecured debt, securitizations, vendor agreements and other instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on libor. uncertainty as to the nature of potential changes, alternative reference rates such as sofr, or other reforms may adversely affect market liquidity, the pricing of libor-based instruments, and the availability and cost of associated hedging instruments and borrowings. if sofr or another rate does not achieve wide acceptance as the alternative to libor, there likely will be disruption to the markets relying on the availability of a broadly accepted reference rate. in addition, uncertainty regarding libor could result in loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, compliance, legal or operational costs and risks associated with client disclosures, as well as systems disruption, model disruption and other business continuity issues for us.
even if sofr or another reference rate becomes a widely acceptable replacement for libor, risks will remain for us with respect to outstanding instruments which rely on libor. those risks arise in connection with transitioning such instruments to a new reference rate, the taking of discretionary actions or the negotiation of fallback provisions and final amendments to existing libor based agreements. payments under contracts referencing new reference rates may significantly differ from those referencing libor. for some instruments, the method of transitioning to a new reference rate may be challenging, especially if parties to an instrument cannot agree as to how to effect that transition. if a contract is not transitioned to a new reference rate and libor ceases to exist, the impact on our obligations is likely to vary by contract. in addition, prior to libor cessation, instruments that continue to refer to libor may be impacted if there is a change in the availability or calculation of libor. the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate may change our market risk profile and require changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design, information technology systems, reporting infrastructure, operational processes and controls, and hedging strategies. in many cases, we may be dependent on third parties to upgrade systems, software and other critical functions that could materially disrupt our readiness if they are not done on a timely basis or otherwise fail. our assessment of the ultimate impact of, and our planning for, the transition from libor remains ongoing. failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. see "md&a-market risk profile" for additional information.
our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders and to attract and retain skilled employees, particularly employees with advanced expertise in credit, risk, digital and technology skills. we depend on our senior leaders and skilled employees to oversee simultaneous, transformative initiatives across the enterprise and execute on our business plans in an efficient and effective manner. competition for such senior leaders and employees, and the costs associated with attracting and retaining them, is high. our ability to attract and retain qualified employees also is affected by perceptions of our culture and management, our profile in the regions where we have offices and the professional opportunities we offer. regulation or regulatory guidance restricting executive compensation, as well as evolving investor expectations, may limit the types of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior leaders and could have a negative impact on our ability to attract, retain and motivate such leaders in support of our long-term strategy. these laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions, and we therefore may face more restrictions than other institutions and companies with which we compete for talent. these laws and regulations may also hinder our ability to compete for talent with other industries. we rely upon our senior leaders not only for business success, but also to lead with integrity. to the extent our senior leaders behave in a manner that does not comport with our values, the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. if we are unable to attract, develop and retain talented senior leadership and employees, or to implement appropriate succession plans for our senior leadership, our business could be negatively affected.
despite the business contingency plans we have in place, such plans do not fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to us. natural disasters and other catastrophic events could harm our business and infrastructure, including our information technology systems and third-party platforms. our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located, which are concentrated in the northern virginia and new york metropolitan areas, as well as richmond, virginia and plano, texas. this may include a disruption involving damage or loss of access to a physical site, cyber incidents, terrorist activities, the occurrence or worsening of disease capital one financial corporation (cof)
outbreaks or pandemics (including the covid-19 pandemic), natural disasters, extreme weather events, electrical outage, environmental hazard, technological infrastructure, communications or other services we use, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. our business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by any such disruption and our ability to implement corresponding response measures, including, for example, our ability to adapt to a remote work environment as a result of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and related response measures. in addition, if a natural disaster or other catastrophic event occurs in certain regions where our business and customers are concentrated, such as the mid-atlantic, new york or texas metropolitan areas, we could be disproportionately impacted as compared to our competitors. the impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. ("u.s. gaap"), we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including determining our allowance for credit losses, the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, and asset impairment, among other items. in addition, the fasb, the sec and other regulatory bodies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards, including those related to assumptions and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements, in ways that we cannot predict and that could impact our financial statements. if actual results differ from the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements or if financial accounting and reporting standards are changed, we may experience unexpected material losses. for a discussion of our use of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, see "md&a-critical accounting policies and estimates" and "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."
limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends and repurchase common stock.
we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries, including the banks. dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries, including the banks, have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, repurchase common stock, make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations. there are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans. these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. if our subsidiaries' earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, our liquidity may be affected and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common or preferred stockholders, repurchase our common stock, make payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations, each and any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or perception of financial health. see "part i-item 1.business-supervision and regulation" for additional information regarding dividend limitations applicable to us and the banks.
the soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties could adversely affect us.
our ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the stability and actions of other financial services institutions. financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, servicing, counterparty and other relationships. we have exposure to financial institutions, intermediaries and counterparties that are exposed to risks over which we have little or no control.
in addition, we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients, resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall. as a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.
likewise, adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of our competitors, the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate or sovereign debt could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments. in addition, adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships also could negatively impact perceptions about us. these perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face.

◦higher provision for credit losses driven by allowance builds in the first and second quarters of 2020 due to expectations of economic worsening as a result of the covid-19 pandemic;
◦lower net interest income due to lower yields on average earning assets and lower outstanding balances in domestic card, as well as higher interest-bearing deposit balances, partially offset by the lower interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities; and
◦higher operating expenses driven by an increase in salaries and associate benefits due to continued investment in technology and legal reserve builds.
◦higher non-interest income due to an unrealized valuation gain of $535 million on our equity investment in snowflake inc.

•net charge-off and delinquency metrics: our net charge-off rate decreased by 47 basis points to 2.06% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by strong credit performance in domestic card due to consumer payment behavior and the related impacts from government stimulus and the impact of short-term payment extensions offered to affected auto borrowers in response to the covid-19 pandemic.
our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 113 basis points to 2.61% as of december 31, 2020 from december 31, 2019 driven by strong credit performance in domestic card due to consumer payment behavior and the related impact from government stimulus, and short-term payment extensions offered to affected auto borrowers in response to the covid-19 pandemic.
•allowance for credit losses: our allowance for credit losses increased by $8.4 billion to $15.6 billion, and our allowance coverage ratio increased by 348 basis points to 6.19% as of december 31, 2020 from december 31, 2019, driven by the allowance builds in the first and second quarters of 2020 from expectations of economic worsening as a result of the covid-19 pandemic as well as the adoption of the cecl standard in the first quarter of 2020.
business outlook we discuss in this report our expectations as of the time this report was filed regarding our total company performance and the performance of our business segments based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies. the statements contained in this report are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in "part i-item 1. business" and "part ii-item 7. md&a" in this report. certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect:
•the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed;
•the potential impact on our business, operations and reputation from, and expenses and uncertainties associated with, the cybersecurity incident, other than the incremental costs related to the incident we expect to incur in 2021 which will be separately reported as an adjusting item as it relates to the company's financial results.
the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are still uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the covid-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the covid-19 pandemic.

table of contents consolidated results of operations the section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for 2020 and 2019. we provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, "md&a-business segment financial performance." this section should be read together with our "md&a-executive summary and business outlook," where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. our interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. we expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.

table of contents net interest income decreased by $427 million to $22.9 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by lower yields on average earning assets and lower outstanding balances in domestic card, as well as higher interest-bearing deposit balances, partially offset by the lower interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
net interest margin decreased by 77 basis points to 6.06% in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by a shift in our asset mix with cash balances representing a greater proportion of total average interest-earning assets, and lower interest rates received on interest-earning assets, partially offset by the lower interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits.

non-interest income increased by $357 million to $5.6 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by a gain of $535 million on our equity investment in snowflake inc., partially offset by lower net interchange fees from a decline in purchase volume.
provision for credit losses our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by changes to the allowance for credit losses including the impact of net charge-offs and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. beginning in the first quarter of 2020, our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments are measured under the cecl standard. we recorded a provision for credit losses of $10.3 billion, $6.2 billion and $5.9 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. the provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 44.8%, 26.7% and 25.6% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
our provision for credit losses increased by $4.0 billion to $10.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by allowance builds in the first and second quarters of 2020 due to expectations of economic worsening as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
we provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for credit losses within "md&a-credit risk profile" and "note 4-allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments." for information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."

non-interest expense decreased by $427 million to $15.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by lower marketing expense, partly offset by increases in salaries and associate benefits due to continued investment in technology.
income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of $486 million (15.2% effective income tax rate), $1.3 billion (19.5% effective income tax rate) and $1.3 billion (17.7% effective income tax rate) in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to the impact of changes in pre-tax income and changes in tax credits, tax-exempt income and non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax earnings.
we recorded discrete tax benefits of $22 million in 2020, $19 million in 2019 and $318 million in 2018 primarily driven by a benefit of $284 million related to a tax methodology change on rewards costs.
the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in our pre-tax earnings and the proportional impact of credits from tax advantaged investments.

table of contents consolidated balance sheets analysis total assets increased by $31.2 billion to $421.6 billion as of december 31, 2020 from december 31, 2019 primarily driven by an increase in our cash balances from deposit growth due to increased consumer savings aided by the impact of government stimulus as well as growth in our investment securities portfolio due to our elevated cash position, partially offset by a decline in loan balances.
total liabilities increased by $29.0 billion to $361.4 billion as of december 31, 2020 from december 31, 2019 primarily driven by deposit growth from increased consumer savings aided by the impact of government stimulus.
stockholders' equity increased by $2.2 billion to $60.2 billion as of december 31, 2020 from december 31, 2019 primarily due to our net income of $2.7 billion and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income of $2.3 billion from investment valuation gains, partially offset by the cumulative effect from the adoption of the cecl standard and dividend payments to our stockholders.
the following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during 2020. period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to support the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements, our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.
investment securities our investment securities portfolio consists of the following: u.s. government-sponsored enterprise or agency ("agency") and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("rmbs"), agency commercial mortgage-backed securities ("cmbs"), u.s. treasury securities and other securities. agency securities include government national mortgage association ("ginnie mae") guaranteed securities, federal national mortgage association ("fannie mae") and federal home loan mortgage corporation ("freddie mac") issued securities. the carrying value of our investments in agency and u.s. treasury securities represented 96% of our total investment securities portfolio, as of both december 31, 2020 and 2019.

we provide additional information on our funding sources in "md&a-liquidity risk profile" and "note 8-deposits and borrowings."
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that these future deductions are more likely than not to be realized. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates. we use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.
deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, were approximately $3.3 billion as of december 31, 2020, an increase of $1.6 billion from december 31, 2019. the increase in our net deferred tax assets was primarily driven by the increase in the allowance for credit losses due to expectations of economic worsening as a result of the covid-19 pandemic as well as the adoption of the cecl standard in the first quarter of 2020.
we recorded valuation allowances of $296 million and $223 million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. if changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years, we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income.
we provide additional information on income taxes in "md&a-consolidated results of operations" and "note 15-income taxes."
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. these activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities ("vies") as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. we provide additional information regarding these types of activities in "note 5-variable interest entities and securitizations" and "note 18-commitments, contingencies, guarantees and others."
business segment financial performance our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking. the operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments. certain activities are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized corporate treasury group and calculation of our residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the other category.
the results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. we use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results. our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. total interest income and non-interest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported. the net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds capital one financial corporation (cof)
table of contents transfer pricing process, which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates. our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses, and a charge for the use of funds by each segment. the allocation process is unique to each business segment and acquired business. we regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods.
we refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our "managed" presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on u.s. gaap. there is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to u.s. gaap; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. in addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with u.s. gaap.

table of contents key factors affecting the results of our credit card business for 2020 compared to 2019, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019 include the following:
•provision for credit losses: provision for credit losses increased by $2.3 billion to $7.3 billion in 2020 driven by allowance builds in the first and second quarters of 2020 due to expectations of economic worsening as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
•net charge-off and delinquency metrics: the net charge-off rate decreased by 63 basis points to 3.88% in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by strong credit performance in domestic card due to consumer payment behavior and the impact of the government stimulus.
the 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 146 basis points to 2.45% as of december 31, 2020 from december 31, 2019 due to lower delinquency inventories in our domestic credit card loan portfolio primarily driven by consumer payment behavior and the impact of government stimulus, partially offset by lower outstanding balances.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. we provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies".
we have identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:
•customer rewards reserve we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary, based on changing conditions.

table of contents loan loss reserves in the first quarter of 2020, we adopted the cecl standard and updated our critical accounting policy and estimate for loan loss reserves. we maintain an allowance for credit losses that represents management's current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in our credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans held for investment portfolios as of each balance sheet date. we also separately reserve for unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. for all such loans and unfunded lending commitments, our estimate of expected credit losses includes a reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year and then reverts over a one-year period to historical losses at each relevant loss component of the estimate. we build our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses, which is driven by charge-offs, changes in the allowance for credit losses and changes in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. the allowance for credit losses was $15.6 billion as of december 31, 2020, compared to $7.2 billion as of december 31, 2019. in periods prior to 2020, the allowance for loan and lease losses represented management's estimate of incurred loan and lease losses as fully described in "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019.
we have an established process, using analytical tools and management judgment, to determine our allowance for credit losses. establishing the allowance on a quarterly basis involves evaluating many factors including, but not limited to, historical loss and recovery experience, recent trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, risk ratings, the impact of bankruptcy filings, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, account seasoning, changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, seasonality, credit bureau scores, current general economic conditions, our reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for credit losses. key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for credit losses include assumptions about employment levels, home prices and the valuation of commercial properties, automobiles and other collateral.
we have a governance framework intended to ensure that our estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate. our governance framework provides for oversight of methods, models, qualitative adjustments, process controls and results. at least quarterly, representatives from the finance and risk management organizations review and assess our allowance methodologies, key assumptions and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses.
we have a model policy, established by an independent model risk office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for estimating credit losses. the model risk office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance.
in addition to the allowance for credit losses, on a quarterly basis, we review and assess our estimate of expected losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. the factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses for the commercial banking business. changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
although we examine a variety of externally available data, as well as our internal loan performance data, to determine our allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments, our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance as well as economic forecasts that may not align with actual future economic conditions. accordingly, our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations. we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies." we provide information on the components of our allowance, disaggregated by impairment methodology, and changes in our allowance in "note 4-allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments."
finance charge and fee reserves finance charges and fees on credit card loans are recorded in revenue when earned. billed finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loans held for investment while unbilled finance charges and fees are included in interest receivable.
capital one financial corporation (cof)
table of contents we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged off. we estimate the uncollectible portion of finance charges and fees in our finance charge and fee reserve. billed finance charges and fees that are ultimately charged-off as uncollectible are reflected as a reduction to revenue.
concurrent with our adoption of the cecl standard in the first quarter of 2020, we reclassified our finance charge and fee reserve of $462 million to our allowance for credit losses, with a corresponding increase to credit card loans held for investment. we review and assess the appropriateness of our finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis. our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables.
asset impairment in addition to our loan portfolio, we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions.
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.
goodwill totaled $14.7 billion as of both december 31, 2020 and 2019. we did not recognize any goodwill impairment in 2020 and 2019. see "note 6-goodwill and intangible assets" for additional information.
we perform our goodwill impairment test annually on october 1 at a reporting unit level. we are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment may have occurred. we have four reporting units: credit card, auto finance, other consumer banking and commercial banking.
in the first quarter of 2020, we adopted accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2017-04, intangibles-goodwill and other (topic 350): simplifying the test for goodwill impairment. under the new guidance, an impairment of a reporting unit's goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
for the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing, we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit's specific regulatory capital requirements, economic capital requirements and underlying risks. the carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements, goodwill and intangibles balances. consolidated stockholder's equity in excess of the sum of all reporting unit's capital requirements that is not identified for future capital needs, such as dividends, share buybacks or other strategic initiatives, is allocated to the reporting units and the other category and assumed distributed to equity holders in future periods.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment. we calculate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow ("dcf") calculation, a form of the income approach. this dcf calculation uses projected cash flows based on each reporting unit's internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. our dcf calculation requires management to make estimates about future loan, deposit and revenue growth, as well as credit losses and capital rates. these cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of capital with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit. discount rates used for our reporting units ranged from 8.1% to 14.3%, and we applied a terminal year long-term growth rate of 3.97% to all reporting units. the reasonableness of our dcf calculation is assessed by reference to a market-based approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available. the results of the 2020 annual impairment test for the reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values of the commercial banking, credit card, auto finance, and other consumer banking reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by between 11% and 273%.
assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain. a change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit, such as declines in business performance from industry or macroeconomic trends or from changes in our strategy, adverse impacts to loan or deposit growth trends, decreases in revenue, increases in expenses, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, deterioration of market conditions, declines in long-term growth expectations, adverse impacts of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of capital, including if these conditions are merely forecasted to occur in future periods, could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future, and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment in a future period.

table of contents fair value fair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. the fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. this hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. the fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
level 1: valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2: valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters. when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. changes in market conditions, such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value.
we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions. if markets are determined to be inactive, it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received. when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs, it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs.
significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as level 2 or level 3. in making this determination, we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the level 3 inputs to the instruments' fair value measurement in its entirety. if level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as level 3. the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. we discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments, including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs, in "note 16-fair value measurement."
our fair value committee ("fvc"), which includes representation from business areas, risk management and finance, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. the fvc regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance.
we have a model policy, established by an independent model risk office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. the model risk office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance.

table of contents the fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the fvc to a more senior committee called the valuations advisory committee ("vac") for resolution. the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes other members of senior management. the vac convenes to review escalated valuation disputes. there were no disputes for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019.
customer rewards reserve we offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, travel, or covering eligible charges. the amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. the majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of rewards an eligible card member can earn. customer rewards costs, which we generally record as an offset to interchange income, are driven by various factors such as card member purchase volume, the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption cost. we establish a customer rewards reserve that reflects management's judgment regarding rewards earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost.
we use financial models to estimate ultimate redemption rates of rewards earned to date by current card members based on historical redemption trends, current enrollee redemption behavior, card product type, year of program enrollment, enrollment tenure and card spend levels. our current assumption is that the vast majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed. we use the weighted-average redemption cost during the previous twelve months, adjusted as appropriate for recent changes in redemption costs, including changes related to the mix of rewards redeemed, to estimate future redemption costs. we continually evaluate our reserve and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, changes to the terms and conditions of the rewards program and other factors. we recognized customer rewards expense of $4.9 billion in both 2020 and 2019 and $4.4 billion in 2018. our customer rewards reserve, which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, totaled $5.4 billion and $4.7 billion as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
capital management the level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. the level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.
capital standards and prompt corrective action the company and the banks are subject to the basel iii capital rules established by the federal reserve and the occ respectively. the basel iii capital rules implement certain capital and liquidity requirements published by the basel committee, along with certain dodd-frank act and other capital provisions. moreover, the banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to pca capital regulations.

table of contents basel iii and united states capital rules under the basel iii capital rules, we must maintain a minimum cet1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%, in each case in relation to risk-weighted assets. in addition, we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0%. we are also subject to the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements, as described below.
in july 2019, the federal banking agencies issued the capital simplification rule, which finalized certain changes to the basel iii capital rules for institutions not subject to the basel iii advanced approaches. these changes, effective january 1, 2020, generally raised the threshold above which a covered institution such as the company must deduct certain assets from its cet1 capital, including certain deferred tax assets, mortgage servicing assets, and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.
in october 2019, the federal banking agencies finalized the tailoring rules, which amended the basel iii capital rules to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions. these categories are determined primarily by an institution's asset size, with adjustments to a more stringent category possible if the institution exceeds certain risk-based thresholds. as a bhc with total consolidated assets of at least $250 billion that does not exceed any of the applicable risk-based thresholds, we are a category iii institution under the tailoring rules. therefore, effective january 1, 2020, we are no longer subject to the basel iii "advanced approaches" framework and certain associated capital requirements, such as the requirement to include certain elements of aoci in our regulatory capital. we remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%) and supplementary leverage ratio requirement, which were previously required only for basel iii advanced approaches institutions. effective as of the first quarter of 2020, we excluded certain elements of aoci from our regulatory capital as permitted by the tailoring rules. the tailoring rules and capital simplification rule have, taken together, decreased our capital requirements.
g-sibs that are based in the u.s. are subject to an additional cet1 capital requirement known as the g-sib surcharge. we are not a g-sib based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a g-sib surcharge.
stress capital buffer rule the basel iii capital rules require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of cet1 capital, above the regulatory minimum ratios. the capital conservation buffer for bhcs was previously fixed at 2.5%. in march 2020, the federal reserve issued a final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement. the stress capital buffer requirement is institution-specific and replaces the fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for bhcs.
pursuant to the stress capital buffer rule, the federal reserve will use the results of its supervisory stress test to determine the size of a bhc's stress capital buffer requirement. in particular, a bhc's stress capital buffer requirement will equal, subject to a floor of 2.5%, the sum of (i) the difference between the bhc's starting cet1 capital ratio and its lowest projected cet1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserve's supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the bhc's projected four quarters of common stock dividends (for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon) to the projected risk-weighted assets for the quarter in which the bhc's projected cet1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test.
under the stress capital buffer rule framework, the company's new "standardized approach capital conservation buffer" includes its stress capital buffer requirement (which will be recalibrated every year based on the company's supervisory stress test results), any g-sib surcharge (which is not applicable to us) and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement (which is currently set at 0%). any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the federal banking agencies set an earlier effective date.
the company's stress capital buffer requirement is 5.6% for the period from october 1, 2020 through september 30, 2021, at which point a revised stress capital buffer requirement will be applicable to the company based on the company's 2021 stress testing results. therefore, the company's minimum capital requirements plus the standardized approach capital conservation buffer for cet1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the stress capital buffer framework are 10.1%, 11.6% and 13.6%, respectively, for the period from october 1, 2020 through september 30, 2021.
the stress capital buffer rule does not apply to the banks. the capital conservation buffer for the banks continues to be fixed at 2.5%. accordingly, each bank's minimum capital requirements plus its capital conservation buffer for cet1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios remain at 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5% respectively.

table of contents if we fail to maintain our capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable buffer requirements, we will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers.
as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, each of the company and the banks exceeded the minimum capital requirements and the buffer requirements applicable to them, and each of the banks was "well capitalized" under pca requirements.
market risk rule the market risk rule requires institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. as of december 31, 2020, the company and cona are subject to the market risk rule. see "md&a-market risk profile" below for additional information.
cecl transition rule as part of their response to the covid-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies adopted the 2020 cecl transition rule which provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the cecl standard on their regulatory capital.
pursuant to the 2020 cecl transition rule, a banking institution may elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting cecl on its regulatory capital through december 31, 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from january 1, 2022 through december 31, 2024. for the "day 2" ongoing impact of cecl during the initial two years, the federal banking agencies use a uniform "scaling factor" of 25% as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the cecl standard compared to the prior incurred loss methodology. accordingly, from january 1, 2020 through december 31, 2021, electing banking institutions are permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax "day 1" cecl adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the cecl standard. beginning january 1, 2022 through december 31, 2024, the after-tax "day 1" cecl adoption impact and the cumulative "day 2" ongoing impact will be phased in to regulatory capital at 25% per year. the following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025.
capital impact delayed                                                                                                                                                                                      phase in period

temporary exclusions for supplementary leverage ratio in addition, in april 2020, as part of the response to the covid-19 pandemic, the federal reserve issued an interim final rule that temporarily excludes u.s. treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio for bhcs. these exclusions became effective on april 1, 2020, and will remain in effect through march 31, 2021.
subsequently, in may 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides an option for depository institutions to make similar exclusions to the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. if a depository institution elects to make such exclusions, it must request prior approval from its primary federal banking regulator before making capital distributions, such as paying dividends to its parent company, for as long as the exclusions are in effect. neither cona nor cobna elected to make such exclusions.

capital planning and regulatory stress testing on june 25, 2020, the federal reserve released the stress testing results for the 2020 ccar cycle, including additional sensitivity analyses conducted due to the covid-19 pandemic, and notified all participating bhcs, including us, of their stress capital buffer requirements. in light of the covid-19 pandemic, the federal reserve required all participating bhcs, including us, to update and resubmit their capital plans in the fourth quarter of 2020, and to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases and capping common stock dividend payments for the third and fourth quarters of 2020 to the lower of (i) the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 and (ii) an amount equal to the average net income earned across the four preceding calendar quarters. scheduled payments on additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital instruments, such as preferred stock and subordinated debt, were not similarly restricted.
we conducted a second round of stress tests and submitted our updated capital plan to the federal reserve on november 2, 2020. on december 18, 2020, the federal reserve released the results of its second round of supervisory stress tests. the federal reserve did not recalculate our stress capital buffer requirement at this time but reserved its ability to do so until march 31, 2021. finally, the federal reserve extended the capital distribution restrictions for all participating bhcs through at least the first quarter of 2021 with certain modifications. in particular, for the first quarter of 2021, participating bhcs may resume share repurchases but the aggregate amount of common stock dividend payments and share repurchases shall not exceed an amount equal to the average net income earned across the four preceding calendar quarters. in addition, common stock dividend payments for the first quarter of 2021 continue to be capped at the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020.

the declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. as a bhc, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. the banks are subject to regulatory restrictions that limit their ability to transfer funds to our bhc. as of december 31, 2020, funds available for dividend payments from cobna and cona were $4.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.
consistent with our 2019 stock repurchase program which was announced on june 27, 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.2 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2019 through the end of the second quarter of 2020. during the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased approximately $312 million of shares of our common stock under the 2019 stock repurchase program before suspending further repurchases on march 13, 2020 in response to the covid-19 pandemic through the program's expiration at the end of the second quarter of 2020. as noted above, for the third and fourth quarters of 2020, the federal reserve required all participating banking organizations, including us, to suspend share repurchases as a measure of capital preservation. on january 25, 2021, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of shares of our common stock.
the timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. for additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see "md&a-capital management-capital planning and regulatory stress testing" and "part i-item 1. business-supervision and regulation-dividends, stock repurchases and transfers of funds".

table of contents risk management risk management framework our risk management framework (the "framework") sets consistent expectations for risk management across the company. it also sets expectations for our "three lines of defense" model, which defines the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for taking and managing risk across the company. accountability for overseeing an effective framework resides with our board of directors either directly or through its committees.
the "first line of defense" consists of any line of business or function that is accountable for risk taking and is responsible for: (i) engaging in activities designed to generate revenue or reduce expenses; (ii) providing operational support or servicing to any business function for the delivery of products or services to customers; or (iii) providing technology services in direct support of first line business areas. each line of business or first line function must manage the risks associated with their activities, including identifying, assessing, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting the risks within its business activities, consistent with the risk framework. the "second line of defense" consists of two types of functions: independent risk management ("irm") and support functions. irm oversees risk-taking activities and assesses risks and issues independent from the first line of defense. support functions are centers of specialized expertise (e.g., human resources, accounting, legal) that provide support services to the company. the "third line of defense" is comprised of the internal audit and credit review functions. the third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the board of directors that the first and second lines of defense have systems and governance processes which are well-designed and working as intended, and that the framework is appropriate for our size, complexity and risk profile.
governance and accountability strategy and risk alignment risk identification                       assessment, measurementand response                      monitoring and testing                       aggregation, reporting and escalation capital and liquidity management (including stress testing)
risk data and enabling technology culture and talent management governance and accountability governance and accountability sets the foundation for the methods for governing risk taking and the interactions within and among our three lines of defense.
we established a risk governance structure and accountabilities to effectively and consistently oversee the management of risks across the company. our board of directors, chief executive officer and management establish the tone at the top regarding the culture of the company, including management of risk. management reinforces expectations at the various levels of the organization.
capital one financial corporation (cof)
table of contents strategy and risk alignment our strategy is informed by and aligned with risk appetite, from development to execution. the chief executive officer develops the strategy with input from the first, second, and third lines of defense, as well as the board of directors. the strategic planning process should consider relevant changes to the company's overall risk profile.
our board of directors approves a risk appetite statement for the company to set forth the high-level principles that govern risk taking at the company. the risk appetite statement defines the board of directors' tolerance for certain risk outcomes at an enterprise level and enables senior management to manage and report within these boundaries. this risk appetite statement is also supported by risk category specific risk appetite statements as well as metrics and, where appropriate, board limits and board notification thresholds.
risk identification the first line of defense and certain support functions shall identify new and emerging risks across the relevant risk categories associated with their business activities and objectives, in consultation with irm. risk identification also must be informed by major changes in infrastructure or organization, introduction of new products and services, acquisitions of businesses, or substantial changes in the internal or external environment.
assessment, measurement and response management shall assess risks associated with our activities. risks identified should be assessed to understand the severity of each risk and likelihood of occurrence under both normal and stressful conditions. risk severity is measured through modeling and other quantitative estimation approaches, as well as qualitative approaches, based on management judgment. as part of the risk assessment process, the first and second lines of defense also evaluate the effectiveness of the existing control environment and mitigation strategies.
management shall determine the appropriate risk response. risks may be mitigated, accepted, transferred, or avoided. actions taken to respond to the risk include implementing new controls, enhancing existing controls, developing additional mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of the risk, and/or monitoring the risk.
monitoring and testing management periodically monitors risks to evaluate and measure how the risk is affecting our strategy and business objectives, in alignment with management's risk appetite, including established concentration risk limits. the scope and frequency of monitoring activities depend on the results of relevant risk assessments, as well as specific business risk operations and activities.
the first line of defense is required to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management practices and controls through testing and other activities. irm and support functions, as appropriate, assess the first line of defense's evaluation of risk management, which may include conducting effective challenge, performing independent monitoring, or conducting risk or control validations. the third line of defense provides independent assurance for first and second line risk management practices and controls.
aggregation, reporting and escalation risk aggregation supports strategic decision making and risk management practices through collectively reporting risks across different levels of the company and providing a comprehensive view of performance against risk appetite. capital one's risk aggregation processes are designed to aggregate risk information from lower levels of the business hierarchy to high levels and to aggregate risk information to determine material risk themes.
material risks, new or emerging risks, aggregate risks, risk appetite metrics and other measures across all risk categories are reported to the appropriate governance forum no less than quarterly. material risks are reported to the board of directors and senior management committees no less than quarterly.

table of contents capital and liquidity management (including stress testing)
our capital management processes are linked to our risk management practices, including the enterprise-wide identification, assessment and measurement of risks to ensure that all relevant risks are incorporated in the assessment of the company's capital adequacy. we use identified risks to inform key aspects of the company's capital planning, including the development of stress scenarios, the assessment of the adequacy of post-stress capital levels, and the appropriateness of potential capital actions considering the company's capital objectives. we quantify capital needs through stress testing, regulatory capital, economic capital and assessments of market considerations. in assessing our capital adequacy, we identify how and where our material risks are accounted for within the capital planning process. monitoring and escalation processes exist for key capital thresholds and metrics to continuously monitor capital adequacy.
capital one identifies and manages funding and liquidity risks that could affect its earnings, balance sheet strength and investor confidence. the company also manages its liquidity position to satisfy regulatory requirements. the company implements its liquidity management philosophy through the liquidity adequacy framework ("liquidity framework"). the liquidity framework enables capital one to meet its liquidity goal of maintaining a fortified balance sheet that is resilient to uncertainties that may arise because of systemic or idiosyncratic liquidity events.
risk data and enabling technology risk data and technology provides the basis for risk reporting and is used in decision making and to monitor and review changes to our risk profile. there is a core governance, risk management and compliance system which is used as the system of record for risks, controls, issues and events for our risk categories and supports the analysis, aggregation and reporting capabilities across the categories.
culture and talent management the framework must be supported with the right culture, talent and skills to enable effective risk management across the company.
every associate at the company is responsible for risk management; however, associates with specific risk management skills and expertise within the first, second and third lines of defense are critical to executing appropriate risk management across the enterprise.

table of contents risk categories we apply our framework to protect the company from the major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities. our seven major categories of risk are:
major categories of risk compliance                    the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules or regulations. compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, contractual obligations or ethical standards that reinforce those laws, rules or regulations credit                        the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract with the company or otherwise perform as agreed liquidity                     the risk that the company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time market                        the risk that an institution's earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors operational                   the risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, failed internal processes or systems, or from external events reputation                    the risk to market value, recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external constituents regarding our business strategies and activities strategic                     the risk of a material impact on current or anticipated earnings, capital, franchise or enterprise value arising from the company's competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position; lack of responsiveness to these conditions; strategic decisions to change the company's scale, market position or operating model; or, failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the company's strategy we provide an overview of how we manage our seven major categories of risk below.
compliance risk management we recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. in response, we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance program to fully address these expectations.
our compliance management program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements, assessing the risk of new product offerings, creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements, monitoring for control performance and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements. the program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the board of directors.
capital one financial corporation (cof)
table of contents the chief compliance officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our compliance management program. business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies, standards, processes and procedures. they regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and our corporate compliance team periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls.
credit risk management we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality. consequently, we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns. our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting. in unsecured consumer loan underwriting, we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting. in commercial underwriting, we generally require strong cash flow, collateral, covenants, structural enhancements, or and guarantees. in addition to sound underwriting, we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans.
the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers, is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority, and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending related transactions. our consumer and commercial chief credit officers are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and the oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments. they also have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions, including individual commercial loan transactions. division presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines. in addition, the chief risk officer establishes policies, delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non-loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio.
our credit policies establish standards in five areas: customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation and portfolio management. the standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes. these standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process. starting with customer selection, our goal is to generally provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns. we use a number of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk, including setting credit risk limits and guidelines for each of our lines of business. we monitor performance relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors.
liquidity risk management we manage liquidity risk by applying our liquidity framework. the liquidity framework uses internal and regulatory stress testing and the evaluation of other balance sheet metrics to confirm that we maintain a fortified balance sheet that is resilient to uncertainties that may arise as a consequence of systemic, idiosyncratic, or combined liquidity events. we continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and to develop appropriate action plans in accordance with our contingency funding plan and our recovery plan, which include the company's policies, procedures and action plans for managing liquidity stress events. the liquidity framework enables us to manage our liquidity risk in accordance with regulatory requirements.
additionally, the liquidity framework establishes governing principles that apply to the management of liquidity risk. we use these principles to monitor, measure and report liquidity risk; to develop funding and investment strategies that enable us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity to support our businesses and satisfy regulatory requirements; and to protect us from a broad range of liquidity events should they arise.
the chief risk officer, in conjunction with the chief market and liquidity risk officer, is responsible for the establishment of liquidity risk management policies and standards for governance and monitoring of liquidity risk at a corporate level. we assess liquidity strength by evaluating several different balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios to ensure we can withstand significant funding degradation through idiosyncratic, systemic, and combined liquidity stress scenarios. management reports liquidity metrics to appropriate senior management committees and our board of directors no less than quarterly.
we seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically. from a strategic perspective, we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and actively monitor our funding concentration. from a tactical perspective, we have accumulated a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash and cash equivalents, high-quality, unencumbered securities and committed capital one financial corporation (cof)
table of contents collateralized credit lines. we also continue to maintain access to secured and unsecured debt markets through regular issuance. this combination of stable and diversified funding sources and our stockpile of liquidity reserves enable us to maintain confidence in our liquidity position.
market risk management the chief financial officer and the chief risk officer are responsible for the establishment of market risk management policies and standards for the governance and monitoring of market risk at a corporate level. market risk is inherent from the financial instruments associated with our business operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. we manage market risk exposure, which is principally driven by balance sheet interest rate risk, centrally and establish quantitative risk limits to monitor and control our exposure.
we recognize that interest rate and foreign exchange risk is present in our business due to the nature of our assets and liabilities. banks typically manage the trade-off between near-term earnings volatility and market value volatility by targeting moderate levels of each. in addition to using industry accepted techniques to analyze and measure interest rate and foreign exchange risk, we perform sensitivity analyses to identify our risk exposures under a broad range of scenarios. investment securities and derivatives are the main levers for the management of interest rate risk. in addition, we also use derivatives to manage our foreign exchange risk.
the market risk positions for the company and each of the banks are calculated separately and in aggregate, and analyzed against pre-established limits. results are reported to the asset liability committee monthly and to the risk committee of the board of directors no less than quarterly. management is authorized to utilize financial instruments as outlined in our policy to actively manage market risk exposure.
operational risk management we recognize the criticality of managing operational risk on both a strategic and day-to-day basis and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers. we have implemented appropriate operational risk management policies, standards, processes and controls to enable the delivery of high quality and consistent customer experiences and to achieve business objectives in a controlled manner.
the chief operational risk officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our operational risk management program. in accordance with basel iii requirements, the program establishes practices for assessing the operational risk profile and executing key control processes for operational risks. these risks include topics such as internal and external fraud, cyber and technology risk, data management, model risk, third party management and business continuity. operational risk management enforces these practices and delivers reporting of operational risk results to senior business leaders, the executive committee and the board of directors.
reputation risk management we recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions and, increasingly, technology companies, in the current environment. areas of concern have expanded to include company policies, practices and values and, with the growing use of social and digital platforms, public corporations face a new level of scrutiny and channels for activism and advocacy. the heightened expectations of internal and external stakeholders have made corporate culture, values and conduct pressure points for individuals and advocates voicing concerns or seeking change. we manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with government officials, media, community and consumer advocates, customers and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry. our actions include implementing pro-customer practices in our business and serving low to moderate income communities in our market area consistent with a quality bank and an innovative technology leader. the executive vice president of external affairs is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our reputation risk management policy and other risk management policies.
strategic risk management we monitor external market and industry developments to identify potential areas of strategic opportunity or risk. these items provide input for development of the company's strategy led by the chief executive officer and other senior executives. through the ongoing development and vetting of the corporate strategy, the chief risk officer identifies and assesses risks associated with the strategy across all risk categories and monitors them throughout the year.

we also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to ongoing credit and counterparty settlement risk, including purchasing securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, extending short-term advances on syndication activity including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten, depositing certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, executing certain foreign exchange transactions and extending customer overdrafts. we provide additional information related to our investment securities portfolio under "md&a-consolidated balance sheets analysis-investment securities" and credit risk related to derivative transactions in "note 9-derivative instruments and hedging activities."
primary loan products we provide a variety of lending products. our primary loan products include credit cards, auto loans and commercial lending products. we sold all of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing during 2018.
•credit cards: we originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. credit card accounts are primarily underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. the underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as fico scores, and on other factors, such as applicant income. we maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans.
•auto: we originate both prime and subprime auto loans through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. our auto loans generally have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 75 months or less, but can go up to 84 months. loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, and are subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant's income, estimated net disposable income, and credit bureau information including fico scores, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value ("ltv") ratio. we maintain an auto securitization program.
•commercial: we offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower's financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. we maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, ltv ratio and standard covenants and conditions. we assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees, if any, and current market conditions. although we generally retain the commercial loans we underwrite, we may syndicate positions for risk mitigation purposes, including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten. in addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to government-sponsored enterprises.

table of contents credit risk measurement we closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. the key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. the key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. in addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates.
we underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. we continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. we also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions.

domestic credit card-refreshed fico scores:(1)
(1)percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. domestic card credit scores generally represent fico scores. these scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. we approximate non-fico credit scores to comparable fico scores for consistency purposes. balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.
(2)percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. auto credit scores generally represent average fico scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.

net charge-offs net charge-offs consist of the amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. we charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for credit losses. uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. generally, costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. see "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies" for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.

table of contents covid-19 customer assistance programs and loan modifications in response to the covid-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies supported banking organizations that are taking actions to assist customers in a prudent, safe and sound manner, including through loan modifications. as part of our response to the covid-19 pandemic, we began offering programs to accommodate customer hardship across our lines of business in the first quarter of 2020, with the largest programs offered to our auto and domestic card customers. our covid-19 programs were designed to be short-term accommodations so that we could provide our customers with prompt relief. information about the customer accommodation programs we offered during 2020 is below, along with the impacts of enrollment on accrual and delinquency status.
additional guidance issued by the federal banking agencies and contained in the cares act provides banking organizations with tdr relief for modifications of current borrowers impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. in adherence with the guidance, we assessed all loan modifications introduced to current borrowers in response to the covid-19 pandemic through december 31, 2020, that would have been designated as tdrs under our existing policies, and followed guidance that any such eligible loan modifications made on a temporary and good faith basis are not considered tdrs. through december 31, 2020, approximately 80% of enrollments in our customer accommodation programs have been for only 1-2 months, which would generally not have resulted in tdr classification under our existing policies as the concession granted was insignificant.
we consider the impact of all loan modifications, including those offered via our covid-19 programs, when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. for our commercial banking customers, enrollment in a customer assistance program is also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating.
auto customer assistance program within our auto business, we generally offered customers a 1-2 month payment extension, with an option to renew, and fee waivers. auto loans enrolled in short-term payment extensions continue to accrue interest. the contractual term of the loan is extended by the length of the short-term payment extension and the delinquency status is updated to reflect the revised terms of the loan. for customers that were delinquent at the time of enrollment, their delinquency status is reduced commensurate with the length of the short-term payment extension. for most of 2020, relief was limited to a maximum of six monthly payments. in december 2020, the limit was reduced to a maximum of four monthly payments when temporary payment reduction programs were made available to customers.
domestic card customer assistance program within our domestic credit card business, customers were offered a one-month payment deferral, with the option to renew, and fee waivers. card loans enrolled in the deferral program continue to accrue interest. their delinquency status was generally frozen at the time of enrollment and, upon exiting the program, resumed the delinquency status at the time of enrollment.
temporary payment reduction programs as the covid-19 pandemic has progressed, we have continued to work with customers to understand their needs. in response to those efforts, temporary payment reduction programs, ranging from 6-9 months, were made available to auto and domestic card customers in the fourth quarter of 2020. as of december 31, 2020, less than 0.1% of accounts were enrolled in these programs.

table of contents other customer assistance programs while the vast majority of enrollments were in our auto and domestic card business, hardship accommodations were also made available to our international credit card, small business banking, and commercial banking customers. for our commercial banking customers, our offerings are more customized, but generally include short-term payment deferrals. we also offered ppp loans to our eligible small business banking and commercial banking clients.
troubled debt restructurings as part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral.
table 28 presents our amortized cost of loans modified in tdrs as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, which excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a tdr and loans that received relief under the guidance issued by the federal banking agencies and contained in the cares act in response to the covid-19 pandemic.

in our credit card business, the majority of our credit card loans modified in tdrs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. the effective interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. if the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.
in our consumer banking business, the majority of our loans modified in tdrs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of these concessions. in addition, tdrs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. in certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto loans where the collateral value is lower than the amortized cost.
in our commercial banking business, the majority of loans modified in tdrs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction or a gross balance reduction. the impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value.
we provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as tdrs, including the performance of those loans capital one financial corporation (cof)
allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments our allowance for credit losses represents management's current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. we also estimate expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. the provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses in "note 1-summary of significant accounting policies."

table of contents borrowing capacity we maintain a shelf registration with the sec so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. there is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. in addition, we also maintain a shelf registration that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust and a shelf registration that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $20 billion from our auto loan securitization trusts.
in addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to fhlb advances and the federal reserve discount window. the ability to borrow utilizing these sources is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the banks' ability to post collateral. as of december 31, 2020, we pledged both loans and securities to the fhlb to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $19.6 billion, of which only $72 million was used. our fhlb membership is supported by our investment in fhlb stock of $30 million and $328 million as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. as of december 31, 2020, we pledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity of $20.0 billion under the federal reserve discount window. our membership with the federal reserve is supported by our investment in federal reserve stock, which totaled $1.3 billion as of both december 31, 2020 and 2019.
funding our primary source of funding comes from deposits, as they are a stable and relatively low cost source of funding. in addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. a key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. see "md&a-consolidated balance sheets analysis-funding sources composition" for additional information on our primary sources of funding.

short-term borrowings and long-term debt we access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. in addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term fhlb advances secured by certain of our investment securities, multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans.
our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. the short-term borrowings, which consist of short-term fhlb advances and federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, decreased by $6.6 billion to $668 million as of december 31, 2020 from december 31, 2019 driven by maturities of our short-term fhlb advances.
our long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations and senior and subordinated notes, decreased by $8.5 billion to $39.9 billion as of december 31, 2020 from december 31, 2019 primarily due to the repurchase of a portion of our senior unsecured debt and net maturities in our credit card securitization program. we provide more information on our securitization activity in "note 5-variable interest entities and securitizations."

table of contents market risk profile market risk is the risk of economic loss in the value of our financial instruments due to changes in market factors. our primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity pricing risk. we are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities:
•traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending;
•asset/liability management activities including the management of investment securities, short-term and long-term borrowings and derivatives;
•foreign operations in the u.k. and canada within our credit card business; and
•customer accommodation activities within our commercial banking business.
we have enterprise-wide risk management policies and limits, approved by our board of directors, which govern our market risk management activities. our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. we provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures.
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities. we manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts.
we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations.
net interest income sensitivity our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of freestanding interest rate derivatives. in addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in table 37 below. at the current level of interest rates, our interest rate sensitive revenue is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease modestly in lower rate scenarios. our current sensitivity to upward shocks has increased as compared to december 31, 2019 mainly due to the decline in interest rates and the growth in deposits and cash.
economic value of equity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures, resulting from movements in interest rates. our economic value of equity sensitivity measure is calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes. key assumptions used in the calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions. in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in table 37 below. our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity increases in higher rate scenarios and decreases in lower interest rate scenarios. similar to the changes in net interest income sensitivity, our current economic value of equity sensitivity to upward shocks has also increased as compared to december 31, 2019 mainly due to the decline in interest rates and the growth in deposits and cash.

table of contents table 37 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of december 31, 2020 and 2019. in instances where a declining interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario.
table 37: interest rate sensitivity analysis december 31, 2020                december 31, 2019
estimated impact on economic value of equity:
in addition to these industry standard measures, we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions.
limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. we regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.
there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. the sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.
for further information on our interest rate exposures, see "note 9-derivative instruments and hedging activities."
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. we are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in pound sterling ("gbp") and the canadian dollar ("cad") that we provide to our businesses in the u.k. and canada and net equity investments in those businesses. we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our euro ("eur")-denominated borrowings.
capital one financial corporation (cof)
table of contents our non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet to translation risk in aoci and our capital ratios. we manage our aoci exposure by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges. we measure these exposures by applying a 30% u.s. dollar appreciation shock, which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a one-year time horizon, against the value of the equity invested in our foreign operations net of related net investment hedges where applicable. our gross equity exposures in our u.k. and canadian operations were 1.7 billion gbp and 1.6 billion gbp as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 1.5 billion cad and 1.4 billion cad as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
as a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal.
risk related to customer accommodation derivatives we offer interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our commercial banking business. we offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties. we use value-at-risk ("var") as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis. var is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment. we employ an historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. as a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. for further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives, see "note 9-derivative instruments and hedging activities."
london interbank offered rate ("libor") transition on july 27, 2017, the u.k. financial conduct authority, the regulator for the administration of libor, announced that libor would be transitioned as an interest rate benchmark and that it will no longer compel banks to contribute libor data beyond december 31, 2021. in the u.s., the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york established the alternative reference rates committee ("arrc"), a group of private market participants and ex-officio members representing banking and financial sector regulators. the arrc has recommended sofr as the preferred alternative rate for certain u.s. dollar derivative and cash instruments. while the arrc has recommended sofr as the replacement rate for libor, there is acknowledgment that the development of a credit-sensitive element could be a complement to sofr. it is unclear as to the likelihood and timing, but such a development would have impacts to our transition efforts.
on november 30, 2020, the ice benchmark administration ("iba"), the administrator of libor, announced that it will consult on its intention to cease publication of the 1-week and 2-month usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31, 2021, and the remaining usd libor tenors (overnight 1, 3, 6, and 12 months) immediately following the libor publication on june 30, 2023. the continuation of usd libor as a representative rate into mid-2023 allows many legacy usd libor contracts to mature prior to cessation and should support customers' and financial services firms' building operational readiness to support new products and additional market developments. responses were due on january 25, 2021 with a final decision thereafter.
we have exposures to libor, including loans, derivative contracts, unsecured debt, securitizations, vendor agreements and other instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on libor. to facilitate an orderly transition from libor, we have established a company-wide, cross-functional initiative to oversee and manage our transition away from libor and other interbank offered rates ("ibors") to alternative reference rates. we have made progress on our transition efforts as we:
•implemented a robust governance framework and transition planning;
•included libor transition language ("fallback language") for certain new legal contracts and agreements;
•started issuing securities and originating agency multifamily loans with sofr-based features in 2020 to align with gse new-issue requirements, and
capital one financial corporation (cof)
table of contents we also continue to focus our transition efforts on:
•monitoring market developments for the application of hardwired language from the arrc;
•engaging with industry experts to better understand the proposed iba's extension announcement and its impact on the markets and our transition plans;
•monitoring and reducing our libor exposure;
•engaging with our clients, industry working groups, and regulators; and
•monitoring developments associated with libor alternatives and industry practices related to libor-indexed instruments.
for a further discussion of the various risks we face in connection with the expected replacement of libor on our operations, see "part i-item 1a. risk factors-uncertainty regarding, and transition away from, libor may adversely affect our business."

item 1a. risk factors there are many factors that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows, some of which are beyond our control. the following is a description of some important factors that may cause our business prospects, results of operations and cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.
business and operational risks the outbreak of the novel coronavirus ("covid-19") pandemic has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and could also adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.
the global spread of covid-19 continues to create significant macroeconomic uncertainty, volatility and disruption. many governments and health authorities have implemented recommendations or mandates intended to slow the further spread of the disease, such as shelter-in-place orders, resulting in the temporary closure of schools and non-essential businesses, or social distancing measures, resulting in modified operations of various businesses including ours, and these measures may remain in place for a significant period of time. while some of these restrictions have been lifted or eased in certain jurisdictions, the resurgence of covid-19 in other jurisdictions has slowed, and in some cases reversed, the reopening process. we could experience disruptions, including as a result of resurgences of covid-19, that prevent us from meeting the demands of our table of contents customers, such as product constraints from our vendor partners and wholesale distributors and other disruptions to our supply chain, disruptions in or restrictions on the ability of our coworkers to work effectively, temporary closures of our distribution facilities, modifications in the operation of facilities that remain open and disruptions of commercial delivery services. the impact of covid-19 and measures implemented to slow the spread have caused and could continue to cause delay in, or limit the ability of, our customers to make timely payments to us and could materially increase our costs. in addition, the pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the us, the uk and canada. during the covid-19 pandemic and even after it has subsided, we may experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of the pandemic's global economic impact, including any recession, economic downturn or volatility, government spending cuts, tightening of credit markets or increased unemployment that has occurred or may occur in the future, which could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices.
individually and collectively, the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations and could also adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and liquidity. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration, the severity and further spread of the outbreak, future resurgences and reimplementation of closures, the availability, efficacy and acceptance of a vaccine, and actions taken to contain the virus, and the effectiveness of these actions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and be sustained. the covid-19 pandemic has and may continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this "risk factors" section.
our business depends on our vendor partner relationships and the terms of the agreements governing those relationships.
our solutions portfolio includes products from oems, software publishers and cloud providers. we are authorized by these vendor partners to sell all or some of their products via direct marketing activities. our authorization with each vendor partner is subject to specific terms and conditions regarding such things as sales channel restrictions, product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor partner programs and funding, including purchase rebates, sales volume rebates, purchasing incentives and cooperative advertising reimbursements. however, we do not have any long-term contracts with our vendor partners and many of these arrangements are terminable upon notice by either party. a reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes in vendor partner programs or funding could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, a reduction in the amount or a change in the terms of credit granted to us by our vendor partners could increase our need for, and the cost of, working capital and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows, particularly given our level of indebtedness.
from time to time, vendor partners may terminate or limit our right to sell some or all of their products or change the terms and conditions or reduce or discontinue the incentives that they offer us. for example, there is no assurance that, as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers, they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us. any such termination or limitation or the implementation of such changes could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
we purchase the products included in our portfolio both directly from our vendor partners and from wholesale distributors. although we purchase from a diverse vendor base, in 2020, products we purchased from wholesale distributors ingram micro, synnex and tech data each represented approximately 10% of total us purchases. in addition, sales of products manufactured by apple, cisco, dell emc, hp inc., lenovo and microsoft, whether purchased directly from these vendor partners or from a wholesale distributor, represented approximately 60% of our 2020 consolidated net sales. sales of products manufactured by dell emc and hp inc. represented approximately 25% of our 2020 consolidated net sales. the loss of, or change in business relationship with, any of these or any other key vendor partners, or the diminished availability of their products, including due to backlogs for their products, could reduce the supply and increase the cost of products we sell and negatively impact our competitive position.
further, the sale, spin-off or combination of any of our vendor partners and/or certain of their business units, including any such sale to or combination with a vendor with whom we do not currently have a commercial relationship or whose products we do not sell, or our ability to develop relationships with and sell hardware, software and services from new and emerging vendors and vendors that we have not historically represented in the marketplace, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
table of contents our sales are dependent on continued innovations in hardware, software and services offerings by our vendor partners and the competitiveness of their offerings, and our ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers.
the technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware, software and services offerings, such as cloud-based solutions, including software as a service ("saas"), infrastructure as a service ("iaas") and platform as a service ("paas"); device as a service ("daas"); the internet of things ("iot"); and artificial intelligence. we have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in hardware, software and services offerings, as well as the acceptance of those innovations by customers. also, customers may delay spending while they evaluate new technologies. a decrease in the rate of innovation, a lack of acceptance of innovations by our customers or delays in technology spending by our customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
in addition, if we are unable to keep up with changes in technology and new hardware, software and services offerings, for example by providing the appropriate training to our account managers, sales technology specialists and engineers to enable them to effectively sell and deliver such new offerings to customers, our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.
we also are dependent upon our vendor partners for the development and marketing of hardware, software and services to compete effectively with hardware, software and services of vendors whose products and services we do not currently offer or that we are not authorized to offer in one or more customer channels. to the extent that a vendor's offering that is in high demand is not available to us for resale in one or more customer channels, and there is not a competitive offering from another vendor that we are authorized to sell in such customer channels, or if we are unable to develop relationships with new technology providers or companies that we have not historically represented, our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.
substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance.
our current competition includes:
â€¢resellers, such as computacenter, connection, eplus, insight enterprises, ntt, presidio, scc, softchoice, world wide technology and many smaller resellers;
â€¢manufacturers who sell directly to customers, such as adobe, apple, dell emc, hp inc. and hewlett packard enterprise;
â€¢large service providers and system integrators, such as accenture, dell emc, hewlett packard enterprise and ibm;
â€¢communications service providers, such as at&t, centurylink and verizon;
â€¢retailers (including their e-commerce activities), such as office depot and staples.
we expect the competitive landscape to continue to evolve as new technologies and consumption models are developed, such as cloud-based and other "as a service" solutions, hyper-converged infrastructure and embedded software solutions. while innovation can help our business as it creates new offerings for us to sell, it can also disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. for instance, while cloud-based solutions present an opportunity for us, cloud-based solutions and technology solutions as a service could increase the amount of sales directly to customers rather than through solutions providers like us, or could reduce the amount of hardware we sell. in addition, some of our hardware and software vendor partners sell, and could intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to our customers. moreover, traditional oems have increased their services capabilities through mergers and acquisitions with service providers, which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers. if we are unable to effectively respond to the evolving competitive landscape, or respond in a manner that is less effective than that of our competitors, our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.
we focus on offering a high level of service to gain new customers and retain existing customers. to the extent we face increased competition to gain and retain customers, we may be required to reduce prices, increase advertising expenditures or take other actions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. additionally, some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate sales, which may require us to reduce prices. this would require us to sell a greater number of products to achieve the same level of net sales and gross profit. if such a reduction in prices table of contents occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products, our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected.
the success of our business depends on the continuing development, maintenance and operation of our information technology systems.
our success is dependent on the accuracy, proper utilization and continuing maintenance and development of our information technology systems, including our business systems, such as our sales, customer management, financial and accounting, marketing, purchasing, warehouse management, e-commerce and mobile systems, as well as our operational platforms, including voice and data networks and power systems. the quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information technology systems, and our success in implementing new systems and upgrades, affects, among other things, our ability to:
â€¢conduct business with our customers, including delivering services and solutions to them;
â€¢support planned growth in services and solutions and continued evolution of the business;
â€¢purchase, sell, ship and invoice our hardware and software products and provide and invoice our services efficiently and on a timely basis; and
â€¢maintain our cost-efficient operating model while scaling our business.
the integrity of our information technology systems is vulnerable to disruption due to forces beyond our control. while we have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats, both internal and external, and from human error, there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective. furthermore, although we have redundant systems at a separate location to back up our primary systems, there can be no assurance that these redundant systems will operate properly if and when required. any disruption to or infiltration of our information technology systems could significantly harm our business or results of operations.
breaches of data security and the failure to protect our information technology systems from cybersecurity threats could adversely impact our business.
our business involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of coworkers, customers and others. in connection with our services business, some of our coworkers have access to our customers' confidential data and other information. additionally, third parties, such as data center colocation and hosted solution partners, provide services to us and as a component of our services delivery to customers. these third parties could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. we have privacy and data security policies, practices and controls in place that are designed to prevent security breaches; however, as newer technologies evolve, and the portfolio of the service providers we share confidential information with, or from which we acquire software and/or hardware for our own internal use, expands as our business grows and the complexity of our business overall increases, and as more business activities have shifted online due to the covid-19 pandemic, we could be exposed to increased risks from breaches in security, including those from human error, negligence or mismanagement or from illegal or fraudulent acts, such as cyberattacks. the evolving nature of threats to data security, in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists, state-sponsored organizations and nation-states, including computer viruses, malware, phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, make it increasingly challenging to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks.
breaches in security could expose us, our supply chain, our customers or other individuals to significant disruptions and a risk of public disclosure, loss or misuse of this information. security breaches could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to our brand and reputation. moreover, media or other reports of perceived vulnerabilities in our network security or perceived lack of security within our environment, even if inaccurate, could materially adversely impact our reputation and business. the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. such breaches, costs and consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
if we or our third-party service providers fail to provide high-quality services to our customers, our reputation, business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.
our services include field services, managed services, warranties, configuration services, partner services and telecom services. additionally, we deliver and manage mission critical software, systems and network solutions for our customers. we also offer table of contents certain services, such as implementation and installation services and repair services, to our customers through various third-party service providers engaged to perform these services on our behalf. if we or our third-party service providers fail to provide high-quality services to our customers or such services result in an unplanned disruption of our customers' businesses, this could, among other things, result in legal claims and proceedings and liability for us. moreover, as we expand our services and solutions business and provide increasingly complex services and solutions, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory and other risks. we also could incur liability for failure to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the new services and solutions we provide to our customers. if any of the foregoing were to occur, our reputation with our customers, our brand and our business, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.
if we lose any of our key personnel, or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our business could be disrupted and our financial performance could suffer.
our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, engage and retain key personnel to manage and grow our business, including our key executive, management, sales, services and technical coworkers.
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of our chief executive officer, as well as the continued service and support of our other executive officers and the effectiveness of our succession planning. our future success also will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our customer-facing coworkers, who have been given critical cdw knowledge regarding, and the opportunity to develop strong relationships with, many of our customers. in addition, as we seek to expand our offerings of value-added services and solutions, our success will even more heavily depend on attracting and retaining highly skilled technology specialists and engineers, for whom the market is extremely competitive.
if we are unable to attract, develop, engage and retain key personnel, our relationships with our vendor partners and customers and our ability to expand our offerings of value-added services and solutions could be adversely affected. moreover, if we are unable to continue to train our sales, services and technical personnel effectively to meet the rapidly changing technology needs of our customers, the overall quality and efficiency of such personnel could decrease. such consequences could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at one of our primary facilities or a third-party provider location could damage our business.
we have two warehouse and distribution facilities in the us and one in the uk. if the warehouse and distribution equipment or operations at one of our distribution centers were to be seriously damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence, including disruption related to political or social unrest, we could utilize another distribution center or third-party distributors to ship products to our customers. however, this may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions in our service and may not enable us to meet all of the needs of our customers and would cause us to incur incremental operating costs. in addition, we operate numerous facilities which may contain both business-critical data and confidential information of our customers and third parties, such as data center colocation and hosted solution partners, provide services as a component of our services delivery to customers. a natural disaster or other adverse occurrence at any of our major sales offices or third-party provider locations could negatively impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.
increases in the cost of commercial delivery services or disruptions of those services could materially adversely impact our business.
we generally ship hardware products to our customers by fedex, united parcel service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges. if we are unable to pass on to our customers future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services (including those that may result from an increase in fuel or personnel costs or a need to use higher cost delivery channels during periods of increased demand), our profitability could be adversely affected. additionally, strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers or periods of increased demand on delivery services could materially adversely affect our ability to deliver or receive products on a timely basis.
we extend credit to our customers for a significant portion of our sales, typically on 30-day payment terms. we are subject to the risk that our customers may not pay for the products they have purchased, or may pay at a slower rate than we have historically experienced, or may seek extended payment terms. this risk is heightened during periods of global or industry-specific economic downturn or uncertainty, during periods of rising interest rates or, in the case of public sector customers, during periods of budget constraints. significant failures of customers to timely pay all amounts due to us could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
table of contents we are also exposed to inventory risks as a result of the rapid technological changes that affect the market and pricing for the products we sell. we seek to minimize our inventory exposure through a variety of inventory management procedures and policies, including our rapid-turn inventory model, as well as vendor price protection and product return programs. however, if we were unable to maintain our rapid-turn inventory model, if there were unforeseen product developments that created more rapid obsolescence or if our vendor partners were to change their terms and conditions, our inventory risks could increase. we also from time to time take advantage of cost savings associated with certain opportunistic bulk inventory purchases offered by our vendor partners or we may decide to carry high inventory levels of certain products that have limited or no return privileges due to customer demand or request or to manage supply chain interruptions. if we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, and if we were unable to return the inventory to a vendor partner, we would be exposed to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence.
we could be exposed to additional risks if we continue to make strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into alliances.
we may continue to pursue transactions, including strategic investments, acquisitions or alliances, in an effort to extend or complement our existing business. these types of transactions involve numerous business risks, including finding suitable transaction partners and negotiating terms that are acceptable to us, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, extending our product or service offerings into areas in which we have limited experience, entering into new geographic markets, the potential loss of key coworkers or business relationships and successfully integrating acquired businesses. there can be no assurance that the intended benefits of our investments, acquisitions and alliances will be realized, or that those benefits will offset these numerous risks or other unforeseen factors, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
in addition, our financial results could be adversely affected by financial adjustments required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("us gaap") in connection with these types of transactions where significant goodwill or intangible assets are recorded. to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
our future operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may result in volatility in the market price of our stock and could impact our ability to operate our business effectively.
we may experience significant variations in our future quarterly results of operations. these fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and may result from many factors, including the condition of the technology industry in general, shifts in demand and pricing for hardware, software and services and the introduction of new products or upgrades. further, if our customers' businesses are adversely affected by the impact of covid-19, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
our operating results are also highly dependent on our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales. our gross profit percentage fluctuates due to numerous factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including general macroeconomic conditions; pricing pressures; changes in product costs from our vendor partners; the availability of price protection, purchase discounts and incentive programs from our vendor partners; changes in product, order size and customer mix; the risk of some items in our inventory becoming obsolete; increases in delivery costs that we cannot pass on to customers; and general market and competitive conditions.
in addition, our cost structure is based, in part, on anticipated sales and gross margins. therefore, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected sales or gross margin shortfall, and any such inability could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
fluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our reported results of operations.
our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. while our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the us are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into us dollars. as a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar relative to the local currencies of our international subsidiaries, particularly the british pound and the canadian dollar, could cause material fluctuations in our reported results of operations. we also have foreign currency exposure to the extent sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiary's functional currency, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
table of contents macroeconomic and industry risks global and regional economic and political conditions may have an adverse impact on our business.
weak economic conditions generally, sustained uncertainty about global economic and political conditions, government spending cuts and the impact of new government policies (including the introduction of new or increased taxes), or a tightening of credit markets, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending on technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows. for example, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the economic and other impacts of the uk's phased exit from the european union ("eu") in 2020, referred to as "brexit". an agreement was reached between the uk and the eu in relation to their future relationship in certain areas, which included a new trade and cooperation agreement relating principally to the free trade in goods (the "eu-uk trade and cooperation agreement"). while the eu-uk trade and cooperation agreement provides clarity in respect of the free trade in goods between the uk and the eu, there remain uncertainties related to the stability and effects of the new relationship. potential adverse consequences of brexit and the uncertainties around eu-uk trade and cooperation agreement include global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, additional costs and operational burdens associated with increased operational restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and other countries and potentially increased regulatory complexities, each of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. we have established a presence in the netherlands to help address future developments, as needed, for brexit, which could add complexity to our european operations as well as result in higher costs associated with serving our customers.
the interruption of the flow of products from suppliers could disrupt our supply chain.
our business depends on the timely supply of products in order to meet the demands of our customers. manufacturing interruptions or delays, including as a result of the financial instability or bankruptcy of manufacturers, significant labor disputes such as strikes, natural disasters, political or social unrest, pandemics (such as the covid-19 pandemic) or other public health crises, or other adverse occurrences affecting any of our suppliers' facilities, could disrupt our supply chain. we could experience product constraints due to the failure of suppliers to accurately forecast customer demand, or to manufacture sufficient quantities of product to meet customer demand (including as a result of shortages of product components), among other reasons. additionally, the relocation of key distributors utilized in our purchasing model could increase our need for, and the cost of, working capital and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
our supply chain is also exposed to risks related to international operations. while we purchase our products primarily in the markets we serve (for example, products for us customers are sourced in the us), our vendor partners manufacture or purchase a significant portion of the products we sell outside of the us, primarily in asia. political, social or economic instability in asia, or in other regions in which our vendor partners purchase or manufacture the products we sell, could cause disruptions in trade, including exports to the us. other events related to international operations that could cause disruptions to our supply chain include:
â€¢the imposition of additional trade law provisions or regulations, including the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions;
â€¢the imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports, including any resulting retaliatory tariffs or charges and any reductions in the production of products subject to such tariffs and charges;
â€¢foreign currency fluctuations; and
we cannot predict whether the countries in which the products we sell, or any components of those products, are purchased or manufactured will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the us or foreign governments, including the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. trade restrictions, including new or increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, sanctions, safeguards and customs restrictions against the products we sell, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of product available to us and adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, our exports are subject to regulations, some of which may be inconsistent, and noncompliance with these requirements could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
table of contents our financial performance could be adversely affected by decreases in spending on technology products and services by our public sector customers.
our sales to our public sector customers and our other customers that do business with our public sector customers are impacted by government spending policies, budget priorities and revenue levels. an adverse change in government spending policies (such as budget cuts or limitations or temporary shutdowns of government operations), shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels, could cause our impacted public sector customers or our other customers that do business with impacted public sector customers to reduce or delay their purchases or to terminate or not renew their contracts with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. additionally, such adverse change in government spending policies, shifts in budget priorities or reductions in revenue levels could impact cash collections from contracts with our impacted public sector customers or other customers that do business with impacted public sector customers, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
legal and regulatory risks the failure to comply with our public sector contracts or applicable laws and regulations could result in, among other things, termination, fines or other liabilities, and changes in procurement regulations could adversely impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.
revenues from our public sector customers are derived from sales to governmental entities, educational institutions and healthcare customers through various contracts and open market sales of products and services. sales to public sector customers are highly regulated. noncompliance with contract provisions, government procurement regulations or other applicable laws or regulations (including the false claims act, the medicare and medicaid anti-kickback statute or similar laws of the jurisdictions for our business activities outside of the us) or security clearance and confidentiality requirements could result in civil, criminal and administrative liability, including substantial monetary fines or damages, termination of government contracts or other public sector customer contracts, and suspension, debarment or ineligibility from doing business with governmental entities or other customers in the public sector. in addition, contracts in the public sector are generally terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency or group purchasing organization ("gpo") or upon default. furthermore, our inability to enter into or retain contracts with gpos may threaten our ability to sell to customers in those gpos and compete effectively. the effect of any of these possible actions or failures could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations and other requirements may increase our compliance costs and reduce our gross margins, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows.
we are exposed to risks from legal proceedings and audits, which may result in substantial costs and expenses or interruption of our normal business operations.
we are party to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, which include commercial, employment, tort and other litigation.
we are subject to intellectual property infringement claims against us in the ordinary course of our business, either because of the products and services we sell or the business systems and processes we use to sell such products and services, in the form of cease-and-desist letters, licensing inquiries, lawsuits and other communications and demands. in our industry, such intellectual property claims have become more frequent as the complexity of technological products and the intensity of competition in our industry have increased. increasingly, many of these assertions are brought by non-practicing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing revenue, but we may also be subject to demands from inventors, competitors or other patent holders who may seek licensing revenue, lost profits and/or an injunction preventing us from engaging in certain activities, including selling certain products or services.
we also are subject to proceedings, investigations and audits by federal, state, international, national, provincial and local authorities, including as a result of our significant sales to governmental entities. we also are subject to audits by various vendor partners and large customers, including government agencies, relating to purchases and sales under various programs and contracts. in addition, we are subject to indemnification claims under various contracts.
current and future litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits or indemnification claims that we face may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management regardless of the outcome. in addition, these matters could lead to increased costs or interruptions of our normal business operations. litigation, infringement claims, governmental proceedings and investigations, audits or indemnification claims involve uncertainties and the eventual outcome of any such matter could adversely affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
table of contents failure to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations applicable to our operations could adversely impact our business, results of operations or cash flows.
in light of the global nature of our business, our operations are subject to numerous complex federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations in a number of areas, including labor and employment, advertising, e-commerce, tax, trade, import and export requirements, economic and trade sanctions, anti-corruption, data privacy requirements (including those under the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act), anti-competition, environmental and health and safety. the evaluation of, and compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and these laws and regulations may have other adverse impacts on our business, results of operations or cash flows. furthermore, these laws and regulations are evolving and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business, and the risk of noncompliance.
we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no guarantee against coworkers, contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.
as a public company, we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure, corporate governance and accounting requirements that increase compliance costs and require significant management focus.
risks related to our indebtedness our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business.
as of december 31, 2020, we had $3.9 billion of total long-term debt outstanding and $525 million of obligations outstanding under our inventory financing agreements, and the ability to borrow an additional $1.0 billion under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit loan facility (the "revolving loan") after taking into account borrowing base limitations and an additional Â£50 million ($68 million) under our cdw uk revolving credit facility. our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:
â€¢making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;
â€¢requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments on our and our subsidiaries' debt, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
â€¢requiring us to comply with restrictive covenants in our senior credit facilities and indentures, which limit the manner in which we conduct our business;
â€¢making it more difficult for us to obtain vendor financing from our vendor partners, including original equipment manufacturers and software publishers;
â€¢limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industry in which we operate;
â€¢placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less-leveraged competitors;
â€¢increasing our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and
â€¢limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and increasing our cost of borrowing.
restrictive covenants under our senior credit facilities and, to a lesser degree, our indentures may adversely affect our operations and liquidity.
our senior credit facilities and, to a lesser degree, our indentures contain, and any future indebtedness of ours may contain, various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:
â€¢incur or guarantee additional debt;
â€¢pay dividends or make distributions to holders of our capital stock or to make certain other restricted payments or investments;
â€¢repurchase or redeem capital stock;
â€¢make loans, capital expenditures or investments or acquisitions;
â€¢enter into transactions with affiliates;
â€¢pledge our assets as collateral;
â€¢merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;
â€¢transfer or sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; and
as a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. a breach of any of these covenants or any of the other restrictive covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders:
â€¢will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;
â€¢could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable; or
the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our senior credit facilities would likely trigger an event of default under our existing indentures.
if we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our senior credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings thereunder. we have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our senior credit facilities. if the lenders under our senior credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness or the ability to borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness. even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, or terms that are acceptable to us.
in addition, under our revolving loan, we are permitted to borrow an aggregate amount of up to $1.5 billion. however, our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is limited by a borrowing base and a liquidity condition. the borrowing base at any time equals the sum of up to 85% of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors' eligible accounts receivable (net of accounts receivable reserves) (up to 30% of such eligible accounts receivable which can consist of federal government accounts receivable) plus the lesser of (i) 75% of cdw llc and its subsidiary guarantors' eligible inventory (valued at cost and net of inventory reserves) and (ii) the product of 85% multiplied by the net orderly liquidation value percentage multiplied by eligible inventory (valued at cost and net of inventory reserves), less reserves (other than accounts reserves and inventory reserves). the borrowing base in effect as of december 31, 2020 was $2.2 billion and, therefore, did not restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving loan as of that date.
our ability to borrow under our revolving loan is also limited by a minimum liquidity condition, which provides that, if excess cash availability is less than the lesser of (i) $125 million and (ii) the greater of (a) 10% of the borrowing base and (b) $100 million, the lenders are not required to lend any additional amounts under our revolving loan unless the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement for our revolving loan) is at least 1.00 to 1.00. it is an event of default under our revolving loan if our excess cash availability and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio remain below such levels for a period of five or more consecutive business days. moreover, our revolving loan provides discretion to the agent bank acting on behalf of the lenders to impose additional availability reserves, which could materially impair the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us. we cannot make any assurances that the agent bank will not impose such reserves or, were it to do so, that the resulting impact of this action would not materially and adversely impair our liquidity.
we will be required to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness and, if not successful, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.
our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. our outstanding long-term debt will impose significant cash interest payment obligations on us and, accordingly, we will have to generate significant cash flow from operating activities to fund our debt service obligations. we cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the table of contents principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-liquidity and capital resources" included elsewhere in this report.
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or revise or delay our strategic plan. we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms that are favorable to us or at all, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements, including our senior credit facilities and indentures. in the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. our senior credit facilities restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.
â€¢the lenders under our senior credit facilities could foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings from them and the lenders under our revolving loan and cdw uk revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money; and
â€¢we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, including secured debt. this could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. the terms of our senior credit facilities and indentures do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so. to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our level of indebtedness described above, including our possible inability to service our debt, will increase. as of december 31, 2020, we had $1.0 billion available for additional borrowing under our revolving loan after taking into account borrowing base limitations and an additional Â£50 million ($68 million) available under our cdw uk revolving credit facility.
certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our senior credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. as of december 31, 2020, we had $1.5 billion of variable rate debt outstanding. if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. although we have entered into interest rate cap agreements on our term loan facility to reduce interest rate volatility, we cannot assure you we will be able to enter into interest rate cap agreements in the future on acceptable terms or that such caps or the caps we have in place now will be effective.
the london inter-bank offered rate ("libor") and certain other interest "benchmarks" may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences.
certain of our credit facilities, including our senior secured term loan facility and our revolving loan, have variable interest rates using libor as a benchmark rate, and we have entered into interest rate cap agreements with respect to the senior secured term loan facility that are based on libor. as of december 31, 2020, $1.5 billion of our total debt outstanding bears interest at variable interest rates using libor as a benchmark rate. the libor and certain other interest "benchmarks" may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. the united kingdom's financial conduct authority, which regulates the libor administrator, previously announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021. however, for us dollar libor, it now appears that the relevant date may be deferred to june 30, 2023 for the most common tenors (overnight and one, three, six and 12 months). as to those tenors, the libor administrator has published a consultation regarding its intention to cease publication of us dollar libor as of june 30, 2023 (instead of december 31, 2021, as previously expected). moreover, the libor administrator's consultation also relates to the libor administrator's intention to cease publication of non-us dollar libor after 2021. although the foregoing may provide some sense of timing, there is no assurance that libor, of any particular currency or tenor, will continue to be published until any table of contents particular date. additionally, the us federal reserve, in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee, a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions, announced the replacement of us dollar libor with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by us treasury securities, called the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"). whether or not sofr attains market traction as a libor replacement for us dollar-denominated instruments, and whether other benchmarks will attain traction in other markets, remains in question and the future of libor at this time is uncertain. if libor ceases to exist, interest rates on our current or future debt obligations and hedging instruments may be adversely affected and we may need to renegotiate the agreements governing such obligations or instruments. although the agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility contains provisions for amending the applicable term loan interest rates if libor is discontinued or cannot be determined, any such amendments will be contingent on our ability to negotiate new "benchmark" rates, spreads and calculation methods with the administrative agent and lenders under such facility. we may be unable to negotiate an acceptable alternative to libor, or if we do agree to amend the facility, the new "benchmark" may perform differently than libor or cause other unanticipated consequences, which could adversely affect our interest expense, related debt obligations and our interest rate cap agreements.
risks related to ownership of our common stock our common stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance, and holders of our common stock could lose a significant portion of their investment.
the market price for our common stock may be volatile. our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased such shares, due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, which may be caused by a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including the risk factors described in this annual report on form 10-k and the following:
â€¢changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of our common stock;
â€¢downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;
â€¢market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;
â€¢announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments; and
â€¢changes in key personnel.
in addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. in the past, securities class action litigation has followed periods of market volatility. if we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.
in the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock and depress our stock price.
anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that may be considered favorable.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of the company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. these provisions:
â€¢authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;
â€¢generally prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;
â€¢provide that special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by or at the direction of our board of directors pursuant to a written resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of the majority of the total number of directors that the company would have if there were no vacancies;
â€¢establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, and will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition. these anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire.
we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase any of our common stock under our share repurchase program, and our indebtedness and certain tax considerations could limit our ability to continue to pay dividends on, or make share repurchases of, our common stock. if we do not continue to pay dividends, you may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.
we expect to continue to pay a cash dividend on our common stock. however, any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. any determination to pay dividends on, or repurchase, shares of our common stock in the future will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. in addition, our ability to pay dividends on, or repurchase, shares of our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness. there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend at the current rate or at all or that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock. if we do not pay dividends in the future, realization of a gain on your investment will depend entirely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur.
we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. as a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. the agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries impose restrictions on our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. the deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," the terms "we," "us," "the company," "our," "cdw" and similar terms refer to cdw corporation and its subsidiaries. "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. see "forward-looking statements" above.
overview cdw corporation, a fortune 500 company and member of the s&p 500 index, is a leading multi-brand provider of information technology ("it") solutions to small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers in the us, the uk and canada. our broad array of offerings ranges from discrete hardware and software products to integrated it solutions and services that include on-premise, hybrid and cloud capabilities across data center and networking, digital workspace, security and virtualization.
we are vendor, technology, and consumption model "agnostic", with a solutions portfolio including more than 100,000 products and services from more than 1,000 leading and emerging brands. our solutions are delivered in physical, virtual and cloud-based environments through approximately 7,000 customer-facing coworkers, including sellers, highly-skilled technology specialists and advanced service delivery engineers. we are a leading sales channel partner for many original equipment manufacturers ("oems"), software publishers and cloud providers (collectively, our "vendor partners"), whose products we sell or include in the solutions we offer. we provide our vendor partners with a cost-effective way to reach customers and deliver a consistent brand experience through our established end-market coverage, technical expertise and extensive customer access.
we have three reportable segments, corporate, small business and public. our corporate segment primarily serves us private sector business customers with more than 250 employees. our small business segment primarily serves us private sector business customers with up to 250 employees. our public segment is comprised of government agencies and education and healthcare institutions in the us. we also have two other operating segments: cdw uk and cdw canada, each of which do not meet the reportable segment quantitative thresholds and, accordingly, are included in an all other category ("other").
we may sell all or only select products that our vendor partners offer. each vendor partner agreement provides for specific terms and conditions, which may include one or more of the following: product return privileges, price protection policies, purchase discounts and vendor incentive programs, such as purchase or sales rebates and cooperative advertising reimbursements. we also resell software for major software publishers. our agreements with software publishers allow the end-user customer to acquire software or licensed products and services. in addition to helping our customers determine the best software solutions for their needs, we help them manage their software agreements, including warranties and renewals. a significant portion of our advertising and marketing expenses are reimbursed through cooperative advertising programs with our vendor partners. these programs are at the discretion of our vendor partners and are typically tied to sales or other commitments to be met by us within a specified period of time.
for a discussion of results for the year ended december 31, 2019, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019, filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 28, 2020.
trends and key factors affecting our financial performance we believe the following key factors may have a meaningful impact on our business performance, influencing our ability to generate sales and achieve our targeted financial and operating results:
â€¢general economic conditions are a key factor affecting our results as they impact our customers' willingness to spend on information technology. this is particularly the case for our corporate and small business customers, as their purchases tend to reflect confidence in their business prospects, which are driven by their discrete perceptions of business and general economic conditions. additionally, changes in trade policy and product constraints from suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business.
â€¢the global spread of the novel coronavirus ("covid-19") pandemic continues to create significant macroeconomic uncertainty, volatility and disruption. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration, severity and further spread of the outbreak, future resurgences and reimplementation of closures, the availability, efficacy and acceptance of a vaccine, and the actions taken to contain the virus, and the effectiveness of these actions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and be sustained. we have mobilized our resources to help ensure the well-being and safety of our coworkers, business continuity, a strong capital position and adequate liquidity. our efforts have included:
â€¢continued focus on the well-being and safety of our coworkers, leveraging standing crisis management protocols and following guidelines from public health authorities and state and local governments. during 2020, we implemented precautions to help keep our coworkers healthy and safe, including activating a cross-functional response team led by senior leadership, moving to remote work for our office coworkers, and implementing safety protocols at our distribution centers, including social distancing measures, segmented shifts, additional personal protective equipment, enhanced facility cleanings, and temperature screening for anyone entering the facilities. all distribution and configuration centers are considered essential businesses and continue to be operational. our office coworkers continue to work remotely.
â€¢remote enablement, operations continuity, and security are customer focus areas to manage remote environments at scale and to prepare to be remote longer. customers are focused on initiatives to reduce costs, optimize resources, and leverage technology for better customer and employee experiences through digital transformation. we have orchestrated solutions by leveraging client devices, accessories, collaboration tools, security, software and hybrid and cloud offerings to help customers build these capabilities and achieve their objectives.
â€¢increasing our provision for credit losses during the year ended december 31, 2020 as a result of the expected economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic. we continue to monitor cash collections and credit limits of our customers to manage the risk of uncollectible receivables.
â€¢closely monitoring our cost structure and liquidity position relative to the overall demand environment. we took measures to enhance liquidity, including completing a $600 million senior notes issuance in april 2020, leveraging the lower interest rate environment by refinancing one of our higher interest rate senior notes in august 2020, implementing cost savings initiatives and suspending temporarily share repurchases from march 2020 through october 2020.
â€¢changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers. given the covid-19 pandemic, education customers have prioritized their budgets towards it spending while healthcare customer budgets have been pressured. as the duration and ongoing economic impacts of the covid-19 pandemic remain uncertain, current and future budget priorities and funding levels for government, healthcare and education customers may be adversely affected.
â€¢technology trends drive customer purchasing behaviors in the market. current technology trends are focused on delivering greater flexibility and efficiency, as well as designing it securely. these trends are driving customer adoption of solutions such as those delivered via cloud, software defined architectures and hybrid on-premise and off-premise combinations, as well as the evolution of the it consumption model to more "as a service" offerings, including device as a service and managed services. technology trends could also change as customers consider the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on their operations.
â€¢the new uk/european union ("eu") trade deal due to the uk's exit from the eu (referred to as "brexit") that came into effect on january 1, 2021 eased concerns over restrictions of imports and exports, but it increased regulatory complexities that may adversely impact our business.
key business metrics we monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, net income, non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating income margin, non-gaap income before income taxes, non-gaap net income, net sales growth on a constant currency basis, net income per diluted share, non-gaap net income per diluted share, free cash flow, return on working capital, cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle, debt levels including available credit, sales per coworker and coworker table of contents turnover. these measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
in this report, we discuss non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating income margin, non-gaap income before income taxes, non-gaap net income and net sales growth on a constant currency basis, which are non-gaap financial measures.
we believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business. for the definitions of non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating income margin, non-gaap income before income taxes, non-gaap net income and net sales growth on a constant currency basis and reconciliations to the most directly comparable us gaap measure, see "results of operations - non-gaap financial measure reconciliations."
the results of certain key business metrics are as follows:
gross profit                                  3,210.1                       3,039.9                       2,706.9

(1)there were 254 selling days for both the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019.
total net sales for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased $435 million, or 2.4%, to $18,468 million, compared to the prior year. the impact of foreign currency fluctuations did not have an impact to net sales growth. for additional information, see "non-gaap financial measure reconciliations" below regarding constant currency net sales growth.
for the year ended december 31, 2020, net sales growth was driven by education and government customers prioritizing integrated solutions including notebooks, accessories and services to support remote enablement and the census project. these public customer increases were partially offset by decreases in most hardware categories in our other business segments due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on customer demand. for additional information, see note 18 (segment information) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
table of contents corporate segment net sales for the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased $653 million, or 8.7%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease was primarily driven by decreases across all major hardware categories due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on customer demand, partially offset by an increase in software.
small business segment net sales for the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased by $113 million, or 7.5%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. the decrease was primarily driven by decreases across all major hardware categories due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on customer demand.
public segment net sales for the year ended december 31, 2020 increased $1,273 million, or 18.5%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily driven by growth in education and government customers. net sales to education customers increased 43.4% primarily driven by notebooks/mobile devices as schools invested in remote enablement. net sales to government customers increased 18.2% primarily driven by the continued delivery on the census project comprised of other hardware, including accessories and smartphones, and services. increases in notebooks/mobile devices also contributed to growth in government customers due to agencies investing in remote enablement and device refreshes. net sales to healthcare customers decreased 12.0% primarily driven by decreases across most hardware categories, as well as decreases in software and services as hospitals experienced budget pressures and delayed projects.
net sales in other, which is comprised of results from our uk and canadian operations, for the year ended december 31, 2020 decreased $72 million, or 3.3%, compared to the year ended december 31, 2019. net sales for canadian operations decreased across all hardware categories, with the exception of notebooks/mobile devices. net sales for uk operations increased primarily driven by increases in notebooks/mobile devices and software, partially offset by decreases across most other major hardware categories. the impact of foreign currency exchange decreased other net sales by approximately 10 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable translation of the canadian dollar and british pound to the us dollar.
gross profit gross profit increased $170 million, or 5.6%, to $3,210 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to $3,040 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. as a percentage of net sales, gross profit margin increased 50 basis points to 17.4% for the year ended december 31, 2020. gross profit margin was positively impacted by product margin and the mix of netted down revenues that are booked net of cost of goods sold, primarily software as a service.
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased $125 million, or 6.5%, to $2,031 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to $1,906 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily due to higher payroll expenses consistent with higher gross profit, higher average coworker count and coworker compensation investments, and a higher provision for credit losses driven by increased reserves reflecting the expected economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic. the increase was partially offset by cost saving measures, including decreased travel and entertainment. total coworker count was 9,982, up 86 from 9,896 at december 31, 2019 due to our recent acquisition.
as a percentage of total net sales, selling and administrative expenses increased 40 basis points to 11.0% for the year ended december 31, 2020, compared to 10.6% for the year ended december 31, 2019 primarily due to higher payroll expenses and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower travel and entertainment.
table of contents operating income operating income by segment, in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, and the year-over-year percentage change was as follows:

corporate segment operating income was $490 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, a decrease of $96 million, or 16.3%, compared to $585 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. corporate segment operating income decreased primarily due to lower gross profit dollars and higher payroll expenses due to coworker compensation investments. corporate segment operating margin percentage decreased 60 basis points to 7.2% for the for the year ended december 31, 2020, from 7.8% for the year ended december 31, 2019 primarily due higher payroll expenses and a higher provision for credit losses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by the mix of netted down revenue and cost saving measures.
small business segment operating income was $99 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, a decrease of $9 million, or 7.8%, compared to $108 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. small business segment operating income decreased primarily due to lower gross profit dollars, a higher provision for credit losses and higher payroll expenses due to coworker compensation investments. small business segment operating margin percentage remained flat at 7.1% for both the year ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 primarily due to the mix of netted down revenue, partially offset by increased payroll expenses and a higher provision for credit losses as a percentage of net sales.
public segment operating income was $678 million for the year ended december 31, 2020, an increase of $203 million, or 42.8%, compared to $475 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. public segment operating income increased primarily due to higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher sales payroll expenses. public segment operating margin percentage increased 140 basis points to 8.3% for the year ended december 31, 2020, from 6.9% for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily due to a mix into more profitable product offerings and services and by cost saving measures as a percentage of net sales.

interest expense, net interest expense, net in 2020 was $155 million, a decrease of $4 million, compared to $159 million in 2019. this decrease was primarily due to paying a lower effective interest rate on the term loan in 2020 compared to the capped rate in 2019, partially offset by additional interest expense on the senior notes issued in april 2020.
income tax expense income tax expense was $214 million in 2020, compared to $213 million in 2019. the effective income tax rate, expressed by calculating income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes, was 21.3% and 22.4% for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
for 2020, the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, a discrete deferred tax expense as a result of an increase in the uk corporate tax rate, partially offset by excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation and tax benefits associated with new irs regulations for global intangible low taxed income ("gilti") and non-deductible expenses for the current and prior years. for 2019, the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, partially offset by tax credits, excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation and a tax benefit related to cdw canada's acquisition of scalar. the 2020 effective tax rate was lower than 2019 primarily due to the tax benefits associated with the new irs regulations for gilti and lower non-deductible expenses.
non-gaap financial measure reconciliations we have included reconciliations of non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating income margin, non-gaap income before income taxes, non-gaap net income, and net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the years ended december 31, 2020 and 2019 below.
non-gaap operating income excludes, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and the associated payroll taxes, a workforce reduction program and acquisition and integration expenses. non-gaap operating income margin is defined as non-gaap operating income as a percentage of net sales. non-gaap income before income taxes and non-gaap net income exclude, among other things, charges related to acquisition-related intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation, net loss on extinguishment of long-term debt, a workforce reduction program, acquisition and integration expenses, and the associated tax effects of each. net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating income margin, non-gaap income before income taxes, non-gaap net income and net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-gaap financial measures. generally, a non-gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap. non-gaap measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.
we believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. management uses these measures to evaluate period-over-period performance as management believes they provide a more comparable measure of the underlying business.

seasonality while we have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year, sales in our corporate segment, which primarily serves us private sector business customers with more than 250 employees, are typically higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters due to customers spending their remaining technology budget dollars at the end of the year. additionally, sales in our public segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters primarily due to the buying patterns of the federal government and education customers. during 2020, we experienced variability compared to historic seasonality trends. as uncertainty due to covid-19 remains, seasonality is expected to continue to be different than historical experience.
liquidity and capital resources overview we finance our operations and capital expenditures with internally generated cash from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2020, we also had $1.0 billion of availability for borrowings under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility and an additional Â£50 million ($68 million) under the cdw uk revolving credit facility. our liquidity and borrowing plans are established to align with our financial and strategic planning processes and ensure we have the necessary funding to meet our operating commitments, which primarily include the purchase of inventory, payroll and general expenses. we also take into consideration our overall capital allocation strategy, which includes investment for future growth, dividend payments, acquisitions and share repurchases. during 2020, we bolstered our liquidity position by completing a $600 million senior notes issuance in april 2020, and leveraging the lower interest rate environment by refinancing one of our higher interest rate senior notes in august 2020. we also temporarily suspended share repurchases from march 2020 through october 2020. we took additional measures to enhance our liquidity by implementing various cost savings initiatives. we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity and funding available for at least the next year; however, there are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds. the amount of cash generated from operations will be dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business plan, general economic conditions and working capital management, including accounts receivable.
as of december 31, 2020, we had total indebtedness of $3.9 billion, of which $1.5 billion was secured indebtedness. at december 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants under our various credit agreements and indentures.
for additional information regarding our debt and refinancing activities, see note 10 (long-term debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
table of contents inventory financing agreements we have entered into agreements with certain financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions. these amounts are classified separately as accounts payable-inventory financing on the consolidated balance sheets. we do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. for additional information, see note 7 (inventory financing agreements) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
share repurchase program during 2020, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our common stock for $341 million under the previously announced share repurchase program. during 2020, we temporarily suspended share repurchases from march 2020 through october 2020 as a precautionary measure in light of the covid-19 pandemic. for additional information, see "item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities."
dividends a summary of 2020 dividend activity for our common stock is as follows:
on february 10, 2021, we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.400 per share. the dividend will be paid on march 10, 2021 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on february 25, 2021.
the payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, business prospects, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law, tax considerations and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. in addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will be limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, in each case, under the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness.
coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act on march 27, 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act ("cares act") was enacted into law. the primary impact to our financial statements as a result of the cares act was the deferral of us corporate income tax payments from the second quarter of 2020 to july 2020 as well as the deferral of employer related payroll tax payments from the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 with 50% to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the remaining 50% to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2022.

table of contents in order to manage our working capital and operating cash needs, we monitor our cash conversion cycle, defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable plus days of supply in inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average. components of our cash conversion cycle are as follows:
days of supply in inventory (dio)(2)              14                        14
(1)represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of accounts receivable, net at the end of the period, divided by average daily net sales for the same three-month period. also incorporates components of other miscellaneous receivables.
(2)represents the rolling three-month average of the balance of merchandise inventory at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period.
(3)represents the rolling three-month average of the combined balance of accounts payable-trade, excluding cash overdrafts, and accounts payable-inventory financing at the end of the period divided by average daily cost of sales for the same three-month period.
the cash conversion cycle decreased to 17 days at december 31, 2020, compared to 18 days at december 31, 2019. dso and dio both remained unchanged at 57 days and 14 days, respectively. dpo increased by 1 day to 54 days driven by mixing into vendors with extended payment terms during the quarter compared to 2019.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased $130 million in 2020 compared to 2019. the decrease was primarily due to decreased capital expenditures of $78 million from fewer purchases of devices for the census program and lower investments in acquisitions.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased $889 million in the year ended december 31, 2020 compared to year ended december 31, 2019. the increase was primarily driven by the $600 million debt offering completed in april 2020, lower share repurchases and increased volume through our inventory financing arrangements, partially offset by decreased borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and higher dividend payments. for additional information regarding our debt activities, see note 10 (long-term debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

table of contents inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results. we generally have been able to pass along price increases to our customers, though certain economic factors and technological advances in recent years have tended to place downward pressure on pricing. we also have been able to generally offset the effects of inflation on operating costs by continuing to emphasize productivity improvements. there can be no assurances, however, that inflation would not have a material impact on our sales or operating costs in the future.
commitments and contingencies the information set forth in note 17 (commitments and contingencies) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. historically, we have not made significant changes to the methods for determining these estimates as our actual results have not differed materially from our estimates. we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and related assumptions will change materially in the foreseeable future; however, actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions. we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors.
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and which require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below. for additional information related to significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, see note 1 (description of business and summary of significant accounting policies) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we sell some of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables, which may include a combination of different products and services. significant judgment may be required when determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together.
for contracts consisting of multiple performance obligations, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its standalone selling price. judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. for certain performance obligations, we will use a combination of methods to estimate the standalone selling price based on recent transactions. when evidence from recent transactions is not available to confirm that the prices are representative of the standalone selling price, an expected cost plus margin approach is used.
additional judgment is required in determining whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or agent, and report revenues on a net basis. for each identified performance obligation in a transaction, we evaluate the facts and circumstances present to determine whether or not we control the specified good or service prior to transfer to the customer. this evaluation includes, but is not limited to, assessing indicators such as whether: (i) we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service, (ii) we have inventory risk before the specified good or service has been transferred to a customer and (iii) we have discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. when the evaluation indicates we control the specified good or service prior to transfer to the customer, we are acting as a principal. when the evaluation indicates we do not control the specified good or service prior transfer to the customer, we are acting as an agent.
the nature of our contracts give rise to variable consideration in the form of volume rebates and sales returns and allowances. we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. the estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available.
we recognize revenue on performance obligations when the customer obtains control over the specified good or service. that is, when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the good or service. for the sale of hardware and software, this is generally upon delivery to the customer. as a result, we perform an analysis to table of contents estimate the amount of net sales in-transit at the end of the period and adjust revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been delivered to the customer. this analysis requires judgment whereby we perform an analysis of the estimated number of days of sales in-transit to customers at the end of each reporting period based on a weighted-average analysis of commercial delivery terms that include drop-shipment arrangements. changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days estimated to make this adjustment.
vendor programs we receive incentives from certain vendors related to cooperative advertising, volume rebates, bid programs, price protection and other programs. these incentives generally relate to written agreements with specified performance requirements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or merchandise inventory, depending on the nature of the incentive. we record vendor partner receivables related to these programs when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. some programs are based on the achievement of specific targets, and we base our estimates on information provided by our vendors and internal information to assess our progress toward achieving those targets.
we also record reserves for vendor partner receivables for estimated losses due to vendors' inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims. in estimating the required allowance, we take into consideration collections performance and the aging of the incentive receivables, as well as specific vendor circumstances.
goodwill goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis each december 1, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. as part of our qualitative assessment, judgment is required in weighing the effect of various positive and negative factors that may affect the fair value. we consider various factors, including the excess of fair value over carrying value from the last quantitative test, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, the projected financial performance and actual financial performance compared to prior year projected financial performance.
if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment, or if indicators of impairment exist, a quantitative impairment test is performed. as part of the quantitative assessment, application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using a weighted combination of an income approach and a market approach, as this combination is considered the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. this analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, determination of our weighted average cost of capital, future market conditions and profitability of future business strategies. the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. however, our past estimates of fair value would not have indicated an impairment when revised to include subsequent years' actual results.
intangible assets intangible assets include customer relationships, trade names, internally developed software and other intangibles. intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset and reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgment and the use of estimates. the valuation, classification and assignment of useful lives are derived using market inputs, historic experience and third-party guidance.
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes and evaluating our tax positions requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state, as well as foreign, jurisdictions. our annual table of contents effective tax rate is based on our income, the jurisdiction(s) in which the income is earned and subjected to taxation, the tax laws in those various jurisdictions which can be affected by tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, and accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances.
we establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. reserves related to tax accruals and valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law in the relevant jurisdiction(s) and our future taxable income levels in the relevant jurisdiction(s) with respect to valuation allowances.
allowance for credit losses we estimate an allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable for future expected credit losses by using relevant information such as historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. the allowance is measured on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist, and a loss-rate for each pool is determined using historical credit loss experience as the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. adjustments to historical loss information involves making informed judgments to reflect our expectations for differences in current conditions, as well as changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions, such as changes in the unemployment rate or gross domestic product growth, when applicable. we also consider internal information on pool specific factors to inform our decision making. we typically observe a higher loss-rate experience with customers in the pools associated with our corporate and small business segments, as compared to the pools associated with the public segment. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we recognized an increase in the allowance to reflect the forecasted credit deterioration due to the covid-19 pandemic, which considered geographic-specific factors, customer makeup and the overall size of our pools, as well as the impacts experienced to date and the impacts from the last significant economic downturn in 2008-2009. as the overall impact and duration of the covid-19 pandemic remains uncertain, our estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change.

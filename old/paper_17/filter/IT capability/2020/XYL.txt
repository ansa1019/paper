item 1a.    risk factors in evaluating our business and investment in our securities, investors should carefully consider the following discussion of material factors and events, along with all of the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec. the events and consequences discussed below could, in circumstances that we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations or market price of our common stock.
these risk factors do not identify all of the risks we face. our business is also subject to general risks that affect many other companies. in addition, we operate in a continually changing business, economic and geopolitical environment and as a result new risk factors may emerge from time to time. risks not currently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may impact our business operations, financial condition or share price. the global economic and geopolitical climate, including the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, amplifies many of the risks below.
risks related to macroeconomic and industry factors industry and economic conditions may adversely affect our markets and our customers' operating conditions, which can in turn affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
with sales in over 150 countries, we compete in a wide range of geographic and product markets. material economic and industry factors impacting our businesses include the overall strength of, and our customers' confidence in, local and global macroeconomic conditions; industrial and private sector spending; federal, state, local and municipal governmental fiscal, trade and procurement policies; strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets; the availability of commercial financing for our customers and end-users; and the degree of funding for our public sector customers, including with respect to water infrastructure investments. the downturn in the global economy due to the impacts of covid-19 has, and continues to have, a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. future slowdowns or prolonged downturns in the global economy or our markets could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
we are exposed to geopolitical, regulatory, economic, foreign exchange and other risks associated with our global sales and operations.
in 2020, 47% of our total revenue was from customers within the u.s. and 53% was from customers outside the u.s. we expect our sales from international operations and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue. many of our manufacturing operations, employees and suppliers are located outside of the u.s. our operations and sales both within the u.s. and internationally are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent in doing business globally, including:
•changes in trade protection measures, including embargoes, tariffs and other trade barriers, and import and export regulations and licensing requirements;
•instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, including economic nationalism, populism, protectionism and anti-global sentiment;
•changes in tax laws and potential negative consequences from the interpretation, application and enforcement by governmental tax authorities of tax laws and policies;
•unanticipated changes in other laws and regulations or how such provisions are interpreted or administered;
•disruptions in our global supply chain;
•unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, including those related to infrastructure and data transmission, security and privacy;
•shocks to the global financial system, including due to global health crises, the effects of climate change, or due to idiosyncratic events, such as a terrorist attack;
•theft, compromise or misappropriation of technology or intellectual property;
•foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or payment of distributions, dividends, loans or advances to us by foreign subsidiaries;
•disruption of operations from labor or political disturbances;
•regional safety and security considerations;
•the transition away from benchmark reference rates based on market participant judgments, such as libor and euribor, to rates based on observable transactions, such as the secured overnight financing rate;
•increased costs and risks in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance, remote work arrangements, language and cultural differences; and
•threat, outbreak, uncertainty or escalation of political instability, insurrection, armed conflict, terrorism, global health crises or pandemics, or war.
additionally, we continue to monitor the impacts of the u.k.'s exit from the eu ("brexit") on our supply chain, operations and financial results. the u.k. and the eu concluded a trade and cooperation agreement ("tca") that has been provisionally applied since january 1, 2021, pending ratification by the eu parliament. the tca creates a number of risks and uncertainties for our businesses. it provides for duties on goods traded between the u.k. and eu, including a preferential treatment provision for no duties on goods that meet certain origin criteria. our businesses may not be able to benefit from the preferential treatment provision given the origin of certain components used in the manufacture of our products and related certification requirements. the tca does not specify rules for trade in services, and as such our services are subject to the world trade organization's rules until the parties to the tca resolve this trade issue. there is also uncertainty as to whether the eu parliament will ratify the tca, amend or reject it in its entirety. in addition, the new trading relationship between the u.k. and eu has increased, and will continue to increase, our costs, including for transportation and duties on products not otherwise eligible for preferential treatment under the tca. we have experienced, and may continue to experience, shipping delays given the need for customs inspections and other procedures at the border, including with respect to requirements to mitigate the risks of covid-19. volatility in foreign currencies and other markets may also arise as the u.k. and eu work through the tca or other new trade arrangements. additionally, once the tca is formalized, there could be other near-or long-term negative impacts. the u.k. will also need to negotiate its own trade treaties with countries around the world, which could take years to complete, and any disagreements on trade terms could result in supply chain delays or other disruptions. as a result, we face continued uncertainty and risks of disruptions in our supply chain and increased costs.
in the year ended december 31, 2020, 19% of our total revenues were generated in emerging markets and we have placed a particular emphasis on increasing our growth and presence in emerging markets. beyond the general risks that we face outside the u.s., our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties, including risks that governments may impose withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, or the amount of any such taxes may increase; governments may seek to nationalize our assets; or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business. in addition, emerging markets pose other uncertainties, including the difficulty of enforcing agreements, challenges collecting receivables, protecting our intellectual property and other assets, pressure on the pricing of our products and services, higher business conduct risks, and the ability to hire and retain qualified talent. we cannot predict the impact such events might have on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
the covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, our business, results of operations and financial condition, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.
our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics. the covid-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our employees, customers, supply chain, operations and sales. the global spread of the covid-19 pandemic has, and continues to, curtail the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in many of the regions where we sell our products and services and conduct operations. government-mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of covid-19, including travel restrictions, quarantines, stay at home or similar measures in many of the areas in which we operate, resulted in temporary production impacts at several of our facilities in 2020, curtailed, and continues to curtail, the business and operations of some of our customers and suppliers, and also impacted, and continues to impact, our ability to access our customers' sites. if the covid-19 pandemic continues or worsens, including mutations of the virus, we may experience a continued decline in sales and customer orders in certain of our businesses. the covid-19 pandemic also has, and continues to, impact our supply chain with unpredictable disruptions, capacity constraints or delays in shipment of materials necessary to the manufacture of our products. while we have taken reasonable measures to mitigate these impacts, as the pandemic continues, or if it worsens, our manufacturing facilities and supply chain may continue to be significantly impacted. accordingly, the pandemic has negatively impacted our revenue growth in certain of our businesses. it is uncertain how materially the covid-19 pandemic, including any mutations of the virus, the corresponding rollout, efficacy or unanticipated consequences of such vaccines, and the pace of recovery will affect our global operations and sales if these impacts persist, worsen or re-emerge throughout 2021 and beyond. the extent and duration of these impacts on us are dependent in part on demand for our products and services, customers' budgets, spending, willingness to allow us access to their job sites and continuation of planned projects, continued funding for infrastructure investments, particularly water infrastructure, our suppliers' ability to continue to supply us with parts, components and raw materials, and logistics providers' ability to continue shipment of our products and supplies.
the covid-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in the financial and capital markets. a further disruption of global financial markets or resulting economic downturn from the covid-19 pandemic or other global health crises may reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital, or increase our cost of capital. there are no assurances that the credit markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations. additionally, concerns over the economic impacts of covid-19 have caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in our stock price. a sustained downturn may impact our liquidity position, including our ability to continue to pay dividends, or may impact our asset values resulting in the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets exceeding their fair value, which may require us to recognize an impairment to those assets. the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, including remote working arrangements for employees, has not to date but could in the future impact our financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting.
we cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of the covid-19 pandemic or the associated economic downturn, impacts on our markets and other impacts to our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. to the extent that covid-19 conditions improve, the duration and sustainability of such improvements will be uncertain, and continuing adverse impacts or the degree of improvement may vary by business and/or geography. actions we may take in response to improvements in conditions may also vary by business and/or geography, and may be made with incomplete information. there is a risk that such actions could be premature, insufficient or incorrect and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
inflation, tariffs, customs duties and other increases in manufacturing and operating costs could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
our operating costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in prices for commodities, parts, raw materials, energy and related utilities, freight, and cost of labor which may be driven by inflation, prevailing price levels, exchange rates, changes in trade agreements and trade protection measures including tariffs, and other economic factors. our operating costs have in the past and may continue to be impacted by price inflation, including in 2021 with respect to the cost of certain commodities, freight and logistics. the u.s. has enacted various trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods we import from china and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by china and other countries. additional tariffs imposed by the u.s., or further retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries, could increase the cost of our products that we may not be able to offset. the tca between the u.k. and eu, which has been provisionally applied since january 1, 2021 pending ratification by the eu parliament, imposes duties on goods traded between the u.k. and eu. in order to remain competitive, we may not be able to recover all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases. further, in a declining price environment, our operating margins may contract because we account for inventory using the first-in, first-out method. actions we take to mitigate volatility in manufacturing and operating costs may not be successful and, as a result, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations.
sales outside of the u.s. for the year ended december 31, 2020 accounted for approximately 53% of our net sales. we also have significant operations in various locations outside of the u.s. we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency transaction exchange rates, particularly with respect to the euro, swedish krona, polish zloty, canadian dollar, british pound and australian dollar. changes in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the u.s. dollar or euro could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar. the translation risk is primarily concentrated in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the euro, chinese yuan, british pound, canadian dollar, australian dollar and swedish krona. as the u.s. dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact business, revenue and income can be impacted. strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business, could materially and adversely affect our sales growth in future periods. refer to item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for additional information on foreign exchange risk.
our pension and other defined benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows in future periods.
certain current and retired employees are covered by pension and other defined benefit plans (collectively, "post-retirement benefit plans"). we make contributions to fund our post-retirement benefit plans when we consider it necessary or advantageous to do so. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in fair value of or investment losses on plan assets, changes in discount rates, or changes in minimum funding requirements established by governments, taxing authorities or other agreement, could increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial condition and cash flows in future periods. in addition, the cost of our post-retirement benefit plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves factors that can be volatile and unpredictable, including rates of return on plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses, change in laws and regulatory actions, rates of future compensation increases, and changes in actuarial experience and assumptions, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
risks related to our business and operations failure to compete successfully in our markets, including our ability to develop innovative and disruptive technologies, could adversely affect our business.
we offer our technologies, products and services in highly competitive markets. we believe the principal points of competition are product and service performance, quality and reliability, innovation, speed to market with new or disruptive technologies and business models, application expertise, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product security, product life cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of our service centers, effectiveness of our distribution channels, price and customers' experience in doing business with us. maintaining and improving our competitive position will require successful management of these factors in a business environment with increasingly rapid rates of change and disruption.
our competitive position and future growth rate depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to successfully: (i) innovate, develop and maintain competitive products, services, business models and customer experience to address emerging trends and meet customers' needs, (ii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, many of which are new and non-traditional competitors from outside our industry, such as large technology firms, or those out of emerging markets, (iii) enhance our product and service offerings by adding innovative features or disruptive technologies that differentiate them from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively, (v) continue to cultivate, develop and maintain our distribution network of channel partners, (vi) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite innovation and technical expertise and understanding of customers' needs to develop new technologies, products and services, (vii) continue to invest in manufacturing, research and development, engineering, sales and marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks, (viii) win large contracts, and (ix) compete for business subject to applicable governmental procurement laws and policies, including the buy america and buy american act requirements in the u.s., as they may evolve over time.
we may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. the failure of our technologies, products or services to maintain and gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings, or customers' slower-than-expected adoption of and investment in our new and innovative technologies could significantly reduce our revenues or market share and adversely affect our competitive position. pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive, or we may not be able to continue to win large contracts, which could adversely affect our market share and competitive position.
cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure, communications networks and operations could adversely affect our business, products and services.
our business operations rely on information technology and communications networks, some of which are operated by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, to process, transmit and store our electronic information, including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personal data relating to employees, customers or other business partners. we have, or operate through, a concentration of operations on certain sites, such as production and shared service centers. with the covid-19 pandemic impacting our business since march 2020, a significant portion of our workforce transitioned to remote working, which we expect to be the case for the foreseeable future, and they are reliant on our information technology infrastructure and communication networks to perform their jobs, as well as access to reliable and safe communication networks in their communities. we also rely on third parties' information technology systems to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including with regard to remote work. regardless of protection measures, essentially all systems are susceptible to damage, disruption or shut-down due to cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware, denial-of-service, computer viruses and security breaches; equipment or system failure, including due to maintenance, obsolescence or age; and other events or circumstances, such as human error or malfeasance, vandalism, natural disaster, fire, power, communication or other utility outage, shutdown or utility failure and other events. in any such circumstances, our system redundancy and other business continuity and disaster recovery planning and response may be ineffective or inadequate.
in addition, we offer certain services and products, including pumps, controllers and meters that may be digitally-enabled or connect to and are part of the "internet of things" (iot), and are used by third parties for operational purposes or to collect data. cybersecurity attacks may target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted by our products after they have been purchased and incorporated into third parties' products, facilities or infrastructure. while we attempt to provide security measures to safeguard our products and services from cyber threats, the potential for an attack remains. a successful attack may result in the misappropriation, destruction, unauthorized access to or disclosure of third parties' confidential information, damage or disruption to third parties' operations, recall of our products or increased costs for security and remediation, as well as damage to our brand reputation.
like many multinational companies, we, and some third parties upon which we rely, have experienced cybersecurity attacks on information technology networks and systems, products and services in the past and may experience them in the future, likely with more frequency and involving a broader range of devices and modes of attack. to date, none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business, operations, products, services or customers. we have adopted measures designed to mitigate potential risks associated with cybersecurity threats, breaches or other disruptions or damage to our information technology networks and systems, products and services but the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions and threats could impact our business, operations, products and services. disruption to information technology and communications networks on which we rely, or an attack on our products and services, could interfere with our operations, disrupt our supply chain and service to our customers, interrupt production and shipments, result in theft or compromise of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets, damage employee, customer and business partner relationships, negatively impact our reputation, result in legal claims and proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, and increase our costs for security and remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
although we continue to assess these risks, implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning, we cannot be sure that cybersecurity attacks or other interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur.
a material disruption to any of our facilities or operations, or that of third parties upon which we rely, may adversely affect our business.
our facilities and operations rely on a complex global supply chain including suppliers (and their suppliers), distributors, contract manufacturers and logistics providers. in addition, our business relies on certain third parties to supply critical business processes and activities, including in the areas of finance, human resources, procurement and information technology. we also have or operate through a concentration of operations on certain sites, such as production and shared services centers. if our facilities or the operations of third parties upon which we rely were to be disrupted as a result of an actual or threatened event or circumstance, including a significant equipment or system failure, natural disaster, effects of climate change, power, water or communications outage, fire, explosion, critical supply failure, terrorism, cybersecurity attack, political disruption, outbreak of a pandemic or other public health crisis, insurrection, armed conflict or war, labor dispute, work stoppage or slowdown, technology failure, adverse weather conditions or other reason, it could cause material adverse impacts to our financial performance, operations and business, including an inability to meet customer demand or contractual commitments, increased costs, reduced sales, and impact our business processes and activities, including our ability to timely report financial results. any interruption in capability may be lengthy and have lasting effects, require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, and require us to make substantial expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect our operations, business processes and activities, profitability and financial condition. any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that we may experience during a disruption or any resultant longer-term loss of suppliers, sales or customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. although we continue to assess these risks, implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning, we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects on our operational and financial performance will not occur.
lack of availability of products, parts and raw materials from our supply chain or the inability of suppliers to meet delivery requirements, could adversely affect our business.
our business relies on suppliers (and their suppliers), including contract manufacturing, commodity markets and logistics providers, to secure and ship select finished goods and raw materials, parts and components that are used in our products. we expect that our reliance on, and the complexity of, the supply chain will continue to increase. parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors, fabricated parts, castings, bearings, seals, batteries, pcbs and electronic components, as well as commodities, including steel, brass, nickel, copper, aluminum and plastics. we are exposed to the availability of these parts, components, materials and finished goods, which have in the past and may in the future be subject to delay, curtailment or change due to, among other things, changes in the strategy or production planning of suppliers including decisions to exit production of key components upon which we rely, interruptions in production by suppliers, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' capacity allocations to other purchasers, changes in trade agreements and trade protection measures including tariffs, exchange rates and prevailing price levels, ability to meet regulatory requirements, weather emergencies and associated effects of climate change, the effects of the covid-19 pandemic or other public health crises, or acts of war or terrorism. in particular, we have in the past and continue to experience capacity constraints and delays with respect to supply of electronic components. any suspension or delay in our suppliers' ability to provide us with necessary materials could impair our ability to timely deliver products to our customers and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
a significant portion of our products and offerings in our measurement & control solutions segment are affected by the availability, regulation of and interference with radio spectrum that we use.
a significant portion of the offerings in our measurement & control solutions segment use radio spectrum, which is subject to government regulation. to the extent we introduce new products designed for use in the u.s. or another country, such products may require significant modification or redesign in order to meet frequency requirements and other regulatory specifications. in some countries, limitations on frequency availability or the cost of making necessary modifications may preclude us from selling our products in those countries. the regulations that govern our use of radio spectrum may change, which may require us to modify our products or seek new partnerships, either directly or due to interference caused by new consumer products allowed under the regulations. the inability to modify our products to meet such requirements, the possible delays in completing or the cost of such modifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, we may not be able to secure suitable partners for co-development of products.
in the u.s., our products are primarily designed to use fcc-licensed spectrum in the 900mhz range. if the fcc does not renew our existing spectrum licenses, our business could be adversely affected. in addition, there may be insufficient available frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations at a commercially feasible price or at all.
outside the u.s., certain of our products require the use of radio frequency and are subject to regulations. in some jurisdictions, radio station licenses may be granted for a fixed term and must be periodically renewed. our advanced and smart metering systems offerings transmit to (and receive information from, if applicable) handheld, mobile, or fixed network reading devices in licensed bands made available to us through strategic partnerships and are reliant to some extent on the licensed spectrum continuing to be available through our partners or our customers. we may be unable to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in some markets to sustain or develop our planned operations, or to find partners or customers that have access to sufficient frequencies in the relevant markets at a commercially feasible price or at all.
failure to retain our existing senior management, engineering, technology, sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified and diverse talent could negatively impact our business.
our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain and attract employees in senior management positions, and in strategic or core competencies, including engineering, innovation, digital technologies, sales excellence, and project management. our success in attracting and retaining employees will depend on our ability to offer attractive compensation, benefits, training and development opportunities in an increasingly competitive environment for talent, particularly in the fields of digital technologies, innovation and data science. in addition, advancing our culture of diversity and inclusion is an important factor for executing on our strategy, driving innovation, remaining competitive and creating long-term value. we also need to continue to develop qualified talent to support business growth and robust succession plans, which are important to our long-term success. a failure to attract or retain highly engaged and skilled personnel could adversely affect our ability to meet and exceed the needs of our customers, operate or grow our business and execute our strategy.
we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring and realignment plans or our restructuring and realignment may adversely affect our business.
in 2020, in response to the business and economic conditions resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, as well as in recent fiscal years, we have initiated restructuring and realignment plans in an effort to optimize our cost structure, improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness, strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers. we are also engaged in a multi-year effort to transform many of our support functions and related technologies, including finance, human resources and procurement. challenges with the enabling technologies and delays in implementing planned restructuring and realignment activities have delayed the realization of some the expected operational and financial benefits from such actions. as such, we may not be able to obtain all of the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring and realignment plans. additionally, as a result of these plans, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge or inefficiencies during transitional periods and ongoing operations. realignment and restructuring require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business.
the successful implementation and execution of our restructuring and realignment actions are critical to achieving our expected cost savings, as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth. factors that may impede a successful implementation include the retention of key employees, the impact of regulatory matters including tax, matters involving certain third-party service providers selected to assist us, including staffing, technology, service providers' compliance with our internal controls over financial reporting, and adverse economic market conditions. if our restructuring and realignment actions are not executed successfully, it could have material adverse impacts on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, our competitive position, business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
our strategy includes acquisitions, and we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions.
as part of our growth strategy, we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of other companies, assets, technologies, product lines and customer channels that either complement or expand our existing business or improve our competitive position. we may not be able to complete transactions with favorable terms or timing, or obtain financing that may be needed to consummate acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. in addition, our results of operations may be adversely impacted by: (i) the failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations, technology, and financial and other systems, (ii) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, which has led to, and in the future may lead to, accounting impairments, (iii) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, control or compliance issues, or other issues for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities.
acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management's attention from existing businesses and operations; insufficient internal controls over financial or compliance activities or financial reporting; the failure to realize expected synergies; the assumption of new material risks associated with the acquired businesses; and the loss of key employees of the acquired businesses. failure to successfully execute our growth strategy via acquisitions and successfully integrate these acquisitions could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial condition or results of operations.
product defects, unanticipated use or inadequate disclosures with respect to our products could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
defects, inadequacies or quality issues in the manufacture, design, software, security or service of our products (including in products, parts or components that we source from third parties), unanticipated use, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products could result in product safety, product security, regulatory or environmental risks, including personal injury, death, property or environmental damage. these events could also lead to recalls, safety or security alerts relating to our products, result in the removal of a product from the market and/or result in warranty or liability claims against us. although we have liability insurance, we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any or all aspects of liability claims. manufacturing, design, software, security or service defects or inadequacies may also result in contractual damages against us, warranty expenses or issuance of credits, which could impact our profitability. recalls, removals, and warranty, liability and quality claims can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our financial results can be difficult to predict.
our business is impacted by a substantial amount of short cycle, and book-and-bill business, which we have limited insight into, particularly for the business that we transact through our significant distribution network. we are also impacted by our long cycle business, including large projects, which could be unexpectedly cancelled, or whose timing can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project that are beyond our knowledge or control, such as funding, readiness of the project and regulatory approvals. accordingly, our financial results for any given period can be difficult to predict.
weather conditions, including the effects of climate change, may cause volatility in several served markets, and may affect our financial results.
the unpredictable nature of weather conditions, including heavy flooding, prolonged droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns, including as a result of climate change, can positively or negatively impact portions of our business, as well as the operations of certain of our customers and suppliers. for example, heavy flooding and rain events, which may be due to global climate change, may increase demand for some of our solutions that may help customers manage water and storm water overflows. within the dewatering space, pumps provided through our godwin and flygt brands are used to remove and transfer excess or unwanted water. on the other hand, prolonged drought conditions drive higher demand for pumps used in agriculture and turf irrigation applications, such as those provided by our goulds water technology and lowara brands. in addition, fluctuations in temperatures result in varying levels of demand for products used in residential and commercial hydronic applications, where homes and buildings use circulating water to heat and cool living spaces, such as those provided by our bell & gossett brand. significant fluctuations in these weather conditions and climate changes can therefore result in volatility in our financial results.
our debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends.
as of december 31, 2020, our total outstanding indebtedness was $3,084 million as described under "liquidity and capital resources" and we may incur additional debt in the future. our indebtedness could have adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:
•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or borrow additional funds;
•reducing or eliminating our ability to pay future dividends or repurchase our common stock;
•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;
•reducing the cash flows available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes to grow business;
•increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade, which could increase future debt costs and limit the availability of debt financing.
in addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms or at all for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have.
our ability to make scheduled principal payments of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend on our future cash flows from operations, which may not be sufficient and may be affected by factors beyond our control. if we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.
we may incur additional impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results.
we have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. as of december 31, 2020, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled approximately $3 billion. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if changes in events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that a potential impairment could exist. significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business or our customers' business, inability to effectively integrate or scale acquired businesses, increases in cost of capital, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, failure of the fcc to renew radio spectrum licenses, divestitures and market capitalization declines may cause impairment of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. for example, in 2020 and 2019, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $58 million and $148 million, respectively, within our measurement & control solutions segment primarily related to the performance of the business of the pure technologies ltd. acquisition ("pure") (as detailed in note 12, "goodwill and other intangible assets"). material impairment charges have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
risks related to legal, regulatory and tax failure to comply with laws, regulations and policies, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, other applicable anti-corruption laws, trade regulations, and data privacy and security laws, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation.
given our global operations, we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of u.s. federal and state and non-u.s. laws, regulations and policies, including laws and regulations related to anti-corruption, trade including export and import compliance, anti-trust and money laundering. our policies mandate compliance with these laws and regulations. the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa"), the u.k. bribery act of 2010 and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local business customs and practices. we cannot guarantee that our internal controls, policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners. in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or business partners have or may have violated applicable laws, regulations or policies, including anti-corruption laws, we are required to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, termination of relationships with business partners and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and as a result might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. in addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business.
additionally, to conduct our operations, we regularly move data across borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding data privacy, data protection and data security, including the california consumer protection act and the eu's gdpr. the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is evolving, often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. gdpr greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of eu law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the enforcement of data subject rights, enhanced security requirements, obligations to guarantee eu data subject rights are not compromised in countries outside the eu, and public disclosure of significant data breaches. other countries, such as china, have enacted or are enacting data localization and security laws that require data to stay within their borders. all of these evolving legal and operational requirements impose significant costs of compliance that are likely to increase over time. any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions and/or civil penalties, damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
changes in our effective tax rates and tax expenses may adversely affect our financial results.
we sell our products in approximately 150 countries and 53% of our revenue was generated outside the u.s. in 2020. given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our effective tax rates and tax expense, including:
•the geographic mix of jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed;
•the statutory tax rates and tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;
•the resolution of tax issues arising from tax examinations by various tax authorities; and
•the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
additionally, tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. the recent change in the u.s. presidential administration increases the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in the u.s. federal tax laws and the interpretation or enforcement of legislation or directives by tax authorities.
we are regularly examined by various tax authorities throughout the world and the resolutions of these examinations do not typically have a significant impact on our effective tax rates and tax expenses but they could. for example, following an examination regarding aspects of the reorganization of our european business that occurred in 2013, the swedish tax authority issued a tax assessment to xylem's swedish subsidiary in 2019, which we are appealing as further described in note 7, "income taxes." this examination as well as other examinations can result in increased tax assessments, and settlement or litigation about the assessments and final resolution could be adverse to xylem. we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits; however, developments in an audit or litigation could materially and adversely affect us. although we believe our tax estimates and accruals are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in its historical income tax provisions, accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.
we face risks related to legal and regulatory proceedings.
we are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the u.s. and foreign countries, any violation of which could potentially create substantial liability for us and damage our reputation. changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other government policies, the nature, timing, and effect of which are uncertain, may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.
from time to time, we are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses (or the business operations of previously-owned entities). these proceedings may seek remedies relating to environmental matters, tax, intellectual property, acquisitions or divestitures, product liability, property damage, personal injury, privacy, employment, labor and pensions, government contract issues and commercial or contractual disputes. our continued transition to connected and digital technologies and solutions has increased our exposure to intellectual property litigation and we expect that this risk will continue to increase as we execute on our innovation and technology priorities.
it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations, regulatory proceedings and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, we may be required to change or cease operations at one or more facilities if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws, regulations or orders applicable to our business.
the global and diverse nature of our operations, coupled with the increase in regulation and enforcement in many regions of the globe, means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. in addition, subsequent developments in legal and regulatory proceedings may affect our assessments and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, that are important to our business. our intellectual property rights may provide us with competitive advantage because they may help us differentiate our technologies, products and services, including our growing portfolio of data analytics and digitally-enabled offerings. however, our current or future intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, misappropriated, independently developed, or designed-around, particularly given our international operations in countries where laws governing intellectual property rights are not highly developed, protected or enforced. our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property, or detect or prevent circumvention, misappropriation or unauthorized use of such property, as well as the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
from time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming to defend due to the complexity and uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. in addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to use critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the use of third-party intellectual property rights, or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations. even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
developments in, and compliance with, current and future environmental and climate change laws and regulations could impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our business, operations, and product and service offerings are subject to and affected by many federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those enacted in response to climate change concerns.
climate change is receiving ever increasing attention globally as many governments, scientists and organizations, such as the united nations, warn of the effects on our climate of increasing levels of greenhouse gases. increased public and governmental awareness and concern regarding global climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and will likely result in increasing environmental and climate change laws or regulations. compliance with these current and future laws and regulations currently requires, and is expected to continue to require, increasing operating and capital expenditures which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, president biden's administration may increase the likelihood of potential changes in these laws and regulations and the enforcement of any existing or new legislation or directives by government authorities.
environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. we also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations. developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments, or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our spin-off from itt may expose us to potential liabilities.
pursuant to the distribution agreement and certain other agreements with itt (now itt llc) and exelis (acquired by harris corporation, now l3harris technologies, inc.), itt and exelis agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify itt and exelis for certain liabilities. indemnities that we may be required to provide itt and exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business. third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that itt or exelis agreed to retain. further, there can be no assurance that the indemnities from itt and exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that itt and exelis will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. moreover, even if we ultimately were to succeed in recovering from itt and exelis any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.
risks related to ownership of our common stock the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.
we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:
•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;
•success or failure of our business strategy;
•our ability to achieve long-term financial or non-financial (including sustainability) targets;
•our ability to obtain financing as needed;
•announcements by us or our competitors of significant new business awards or technologies, product and service offerings;
•announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or divestitures;
•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;
•changes in earnings estimates or guidance by us or securities analysts or our ability to meet such guidance and estimates;
•our ability to execute restructuring and realignment actions;
•the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;
•natural or environmental disasters or climate change considerations that investors believe may affect us;
•uncertainty or instability arising from the global geopolitical environment or events, covid-19 or other actual or potential pandemics;
•fluctuations in foreign currency impacts;
•fluctuations in the budgets or spending of federal, state and local governmental entities around the world;
•results from any material litigation, governmental or regulatory body investigation, or tax examination;
•changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;
•overall market fluctuations or general economic conditions and other external factors.
stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
item 7.        management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business. except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, "xylem," "we," "us," "our" and "the company" refer to xylem inc. and its subsidiaries.
this section of this form 10-k generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2019.
overview xylem is a leading global water technology company. we design, manufacture and service highly engineered products and solutions ranging across a wide variety of critical applications in utility, industrial, residential and commercial building services settings. our broad portfolio of solutions addresses customer needs across the water cycle, from the delivery, measurement and use of drinking water to the collection, test, treatment and analysis of wastewater to the return of water to the environment. our product and service offerings are organized into three reportable segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide: water infrastructure, applied water and measurement & control solutions.
•water infrastructure serves the water infrastructure sector with pump systems that transport water from aquifers, lakes, rivers and seas; with filtration, ultraviolet and ozone systems that provide treatment, making the water fit to use; and pumping solutions that move the wastewater and storm water to treatment facilities where our mixers, biological treatment, monitoring and control systems provide the primary functions in the treatment process. we also provide sales and rental of specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services. additionally, our offerings use monitoring and control, smart and connected technologies to allow for remote monitoring of performance and enable products to self-optimize pump operations maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing unplanned downtime and maintenance for our customers. in the water infrastructure segment, we provide the majority of our sales directly to customers along with strong applications expertise, while the remaining amount is through distribution partners.
•applied water serves the water usage applications sector with water pressure boosting systems for heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and for fire protection systems to the residential and commercial building services markets. in addition, our pumps, heat exchangers and controls provide cooling to power plants and manufacturing facilities, circulation for food and beverage processing, as well as boosting systems for agricultural irrigation. in the applied water segment, we provide the majority of our sales through long-standing relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve, with the remainder going directly to customers.
•measurement & control solutions primarily serves the utility infrastructure solutions and services sector by delivering communications, smart metering, measurement and control technologies and critical infrastructure technologies that allow customers to more effectively use their distribution networks for the delivery, monitoring and control of critical resources such as water, electricity and natural gas. we also provide analytical instrumentation used to measure and analyze water quality, flow and level in clean water, wastewater, surface water and coastal environments. additionally, we offer software and services including cloud-based analytics, remote monitoring and data management, leak detection, condition assessment, asset management and pressure monitoring solutions. in the measurement & control solutions segment, we generate our sales through a combination of long-standing relationships with leading distributors and dedicated channel partners as well as direct sales depending on the regional availability of distribution channels and the type of product.
this section summarizes the most significant impacts related to the covid-19 pandemic that we have experienced to date, and we have included additional details as applicable throughout other sections of this annual report. many of these impacts did not begin to be felt broadly across our businesses until the latter part of the first quarter of 2020 and have continued through the remainder of the year. as the covid-19 pandemic began to unfold in the first quarter of 2020, xylem deployed a covid-19 response team, responsible for xylem's pandemic plan, which is designed to aid in prevention, preparedness, response and recovery at our sites and across the company.
depending on the severity, magnitude and duration of the covid-19 pandemic and its economic consequences, we anticipate that it will become more difficult to distinguish specific aspects of our operational and financial performance that are most directly related to covid-19 from those that are more broadly influenced by ongoing macroeconomic, market and industry dynamics that are, to varying degrees, related to the covid-19 pandemic and its consequences.
public health officials have recommended, or governments have mandated, precautions to mitigate the spread of covid-19, including stay at home or similar measures, such as travel restrictions, for periods of time in many of the areas in which we operate. operationally, a number of our production facilities across the globe experienced reduced production levels due to such measures to varying degrees during the year, however our current overall operating capacity approximates normal levels globally. in order to maintain a safe work environment, our production facilities continue to spread operations over multiple shifts and implement other protective measures such as testing, temperature screening and social distancing, while maintaining operational capabilities.
the covid-19 pandemic is also adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, supply chains and businesses. we expect to continue experiencing unpredictable interruptions with our external suppliers into 2021 that could lead to increased logistic costs. we have enhanced our supplier pulsing and redundancy to help mitigate these challenges and do not expect these interruptions to result in a material impact to our business. additionally, we have in the past and may continue to take measures with respect to buffer stock to minimize freight and logistics delays. if these interruptions are sustained, or additional interruptions occur, they could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
to date, the most significant operational impacts we have experienced are volume reductions ranging across all segments and major geographic regions. although regions such as europe and china have started to recover and experienced organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter of 2020, recovery in regions such as the u.s., the middle east and india continues to lag.
future demand for our products and services is uncertain as the covid-19 pandemic has also had an adverse impact on many of the customers we serve. as such, we have, and may continue to, experience decreased or delayed demand for our products and services. at the end of 2020, total backlog increased 17.9% as compared to december 31, 2019. in many cases, xylem's products and services are considered "essential services" under various governmental mandates, and as a result we did not experience significant issues in our ability to distribute products or services, aside from customer-driven project delays, inability to access or travel to customer sites and shipping delays due to stay at home measures. however, because the severity, magnitude and duration of the covid-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, the pandemic's ongoing and future impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price remain uncertain and difficult to predict, and we expect that our results may continue to be adversely impacted beyond the year ending december 31, 2020.
in response to the changes in business and economic conditions arising as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, management committed to restructuring activities across our businesses and functions globally during the second quarter of 2020. these initiatives are designed to support our long-term financial resilience and simplify our operations, strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers. in light of the uncertainty created by the covid-19 pandemic, we also proactively took further cost reduction actions in 2020, which included a temporary 20% reduction in the base salary of the company's chief executive officer ("ceo") and all ceo direct reports, and a temporary 20% reduction in annual cash retainer fees payable to our board of directors effective from june 1, 2020 through december 31, 2020. additionally, in 2020 we committed to reduced capital expenditure and discretionary operating spending. we anticipate that our capital expenditure spending will ramp up to more normal levels throughout 2021 as we see improvements in our markets.
since the pandemic started, xylem has taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, work with our customers to minimize potential disruptions and positively impact our communities. in the first quarter of
2020, we implemented a support pay program for employees impacted by covid-19, and an essential services premium pay program for the benefit of employees whose roles are classified as an "essential service" and, as such, are required to work either onsite at a xylem facility or in the field supporting customers during periods of mandated stay at home or similar measures. these programs will remain in place through the first quarter of 2021 and continue to be evaluated for continuation as necessary going forward. xylem watermark, our corporate social responsibility program, is also supporting our communities in addressing the challenges posed by this global pandemic through its partnership with americares and unicef, as well as the expansion of the partner community grants program and matching donations program for employees and partners, and other philanthropic commitments. during 2020, xylem also re-purposed internal manufacturing capabilities and, working with our partners, leveraged our supply chain to donate 300,000 pieces of personal protective equipment ("ppe") to frontline workers.
many of our offices globally have transitioned to a substantially remote work from home status, with no material disruption to operations, financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. as public health officials and governments ease recommendations and regulations regarding stay at home measures, our covid-19 response team applies a set of xylem "return to workplace" health and safety guidelines for remote workers to return to our facilities. these guidelines require government officials to first declare an easing of their restrictions, upon which we do a full review of our site to determine its readiness and follow a phased return to work approach, all in service to help ensure the safety of our people.
we will continue to work with our customers, employees, suppliers and communities to address the impacts of covid-19. we also continue to assess the evolving nature of the pandemic and its possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences.
risks related to the impact of covid-19 are described in further detail under "item 1a. risk factors".
key performance indicators and non-gaap measures management reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and operating income margins, ebitda and ebitda margins, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. in addition, we consider certain non-gaap (or "adjusted") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. this information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including, but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. excluding revenue, xylem provides guidance only on a non-gaap basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in gaap earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. these adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. these metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap. we consider the following items represent the non-gaap measures we consider to be key performance indicators, as well as the related reconciling items to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. the non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.

executive summary xylem reported revenue of $4,876 million for 2020, a decrease of $373 million, or 7.1%, from $5,249 million reported in 2019. on a constant currency basis, revenue decreased by $366 million, or 7.0%, driven by an organic decline across all end markets and across all segments during the year. organic revenue decline during the year was anticipated as our business was negatively impacted by the covid-19 pandemic.
operating income for 2020 was $367 million, reflecting a decrease of $119 million, or 24.5%, compared to $486 million in 2019. operating margin was 7.5% for 2020 versus 9.3% for 2019, a decrease of 180 basis points. operating margin benefited from decreases in special charges of $78 million and decreases in restructuring and realignment costs of $5 million during the year. excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating income was $525 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 10.8% in 2020 as compared to adjusted operating income of $727 million with an adjusted operating margin of 13.9% in 2019, a decrease of 310 basis points. the decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to unfavorable volume, impacted significantly by covid-19; cost inflation; increased quality management costs; unfavorable mix and increased spending on strategic investments. these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our productivity, restructuring and other cost saving initiatives.
additional financial highlights for 2020 include the following:
•net cash provided by operating activities of $824 million and free cash flow of $641 million, up 5% from 2019
2021 business outlook we anticipate total revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% in 2021, with organic revenue growth anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 5%. the following is a summary of our 2020 organic revenue performance and 2021 organic revenue outlook by end market.
•utilities revenue decreased by approximately 6% for 2020 on an organic basis driven by weakness in the u.s., the middle east and asia pacific, partially offset by strength in europe. for 2021, we expect organic growth in the low-to-mid single-digit range with continued resilience on the wastewater side, as utilities remain focused on mission-critical applications and anticipate modest recovery on a global basis through the year. additionally, we expect that large clean water utility project deployments will be ramping up beginning in the second quarter and increasing throughout the end of the year. we expect to gain momentum behind key multi-year wins setting up healthy longer term growth, however we believe the end market will continue to be impacted by the covid-19 pandemic through the year.
•industrial revenue decreased by approximately 10% for 2020 on an organic basis driven by weakness across all major geographic regions. for 2021, we expect organic revenue to be relatively flat to up low-single-digits as short-cycle orders and project activity continues to pick up during the year, however activity is still likely to be limited in the near-term by covid-19 impacts. we expect that continued softness in the segments served by our dewatering business in north america will stabilize and begin to accelerate through the year.
•in the commercial markets, organic revenue decline was approximately 6% for 2020 driven by weakness in the u.s. and the emerging markets, partially offset by strength in western europe. for 2021, we expect organic revenue to be relatively flat to down low-single-digits. we expect replacement business in the u.s. to be modestly soft during the year, as the covid-19 pandemic continues to impact market conditions. while we anticipate healthy activity in europe as the region continues to recover, we expect new construction activity in north america to be slow throughout the first half of the year.
•in residential markets, organic revenue decline was approximately 2% in 2020 driven by weakness in the u.s. and western europe, partially offset by strength in asia pacific. this market is primarily driven by replacement revenue serviced through our distribution network. for 2021, we expect organic revenue to be up low-to-mid single digits, driven by healthy demand activity from increased residential users in the u.s.
and europe. additionally, we anticipate strong demand in china for secondary water supply product applications.
we will continue to strategically execute restructuring and realignment actions in an effort to optimize our cost structure, improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness, strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers. during 2020, we incurred $54 million and $23 million in restructuring and realignment costs, respectively. we realized approximately $25 million of incremental net savings in 2020 from actions initiated in 2019, and an additional $22 million of net savings from our 2020 actions. as a result of our 2019 and 2020 actions we expect to realize approximately $46 million of incremental net savings in 2021 and beyond. during 2021, we currently expect to incur between $50 million and $60 million in restructuring and realignment costs.
we plan to continue to take actions and focus spending in 2021 on actions that allow us to make progress on our top strategic priorities. these priorities include (1) driving customer success by focusing on enhancing the customer experience, accelerating the digital transformation of water and building a leadership position in services and solutions; (2) growing in the emerging markets by investing in localizing our capabilities in these regions; (3) strengthening innovation and technology by creating new customer offerings that help solve water challenges in a more powerful way; (4) enhancing operational excellence by building a culture of continuous improvement; and (5) cultivating leadership talent and development that drives shareholder value creation.

revenue revenue generated for 2020 was $4,876 million, a decrease of $373 million, or 7.1%, compared to $5,249 million in 2019. on a constant currency basis, revenue declined 7.0% during 2020. the decrease at constant currency was driven by a decline in organic revenue of $364 million reflecting significantly lower volumes in the u.s., primarily, as well as the middle east, india and latin america, largely due to covid-19, partially offset by growth in europe and china during the year.
the following table illustrates the impact from organic declines, recent acquisitions and divestitures, and foreign currency translation in relation to revenue during 2020:

(a)foreign currency translation impact for the year primarily due to the weakening in value of various currencies against the u.s. dollar, the largest being the russian ruble, the norwegian krone, the brazilian real, the south african rand and the chilean peso. these impacts were partially offset by the strengthening of the euro during the year.
water infrastructure water infrastructure revenue decreased $98 million, or 4.5%, to $2,079 million in 2020 (4.1% decrease on a constant currency basis) compared to 2019. revenue was negatively impacted by $9 million of foreign currency translation, with the change at constant currency coming entirely from an organic decline during the year of $89 million. organic weakness during the year was primarily driven by the industrial end market, particularly in north america and the emerging markets, heavily impacted by the covid-19 pandemic during the year. organic revenue decline during the year was also impacted by weakness, to a lesser extent, in the utility end market, particularly in the u.s., partially offset by organic growth in europe during the year. the covid-19 pandemic negatively impacted organic growth during the year throughout the entire segment and both end markets.
from an application perspective, the organic revenue decline for the year was driven by our transport application, where market conditions continued to soften in the u.s. in the dewatering applications, with construction, mining, oil and gas all down during the year. we also saw organic revenue decline in asia pacific within the transport application, primarily in india, where we lapped some large projects executed in the prior year, as well as in latin america. these declines were partially offset by organic growth in europe during the year, where demand for essential service work increased during the fourth quarter. organic revenue declines within the transport application were partially offset by modest organic growth in the treatment application during the year, primarily driven by projects in the emerging markets.
applied water applied water revenue decreased $107 million, or 6.9%, in 2020 (7.0% decrease on a constant currency basis) compared to 2019. revenue benefited from $1 million of foreign currency translation, with the change at constant currency coming entirely from an organic decline during the year of $108 million. organic weakness during the year was driven by declines across all end markets and applications, with industrial water and commercial building services declining the most, followed by a modest decline in building services in the residential market as well. organic revenue declines in the segment were driven by the covid-19 pandemic, where restricted activities caused a slow down and general softening in markets served, particularly in the u.s., the emerging markets and western europe.
measurement & control solutions measurement & control solutions revenue decreased $168 million, or 11.0%, in 2020 (11.0% decrease on a constant currency basis) compared to 2019. revenue benefited from $1 million of foreign currency translation during the year, with the change at constant currency driven by an organic decline of $167 million, or 10.9%, and to a lesser extent, $2 million of reduced revenue related to divestiture impacts during the year. organic weakness during the year was driven by declines in the utility end market, primarily in the u.s., the middle east and india, marginally offset by organic growth in western europe during the year. organic declines were also driven, to a lesser extent, by weakness in the industrial end market, primarily in western europe, north america, and the middle east. organic revenue declines in the segment were significantly impacted by project timing and the covid-19 pandemic during the year.
from an application perspective, the organic revenue decline was primarily driven by the water application, where we lapped large prior year project deployments in the u.s. and middle east and the covid-19 pandemic drove project delays, primarily due to site-access restrictions, and overall market softness in the u.s. the energy application also had a decline in organic revenue as compared to the prior year, primarily in the u.s. as we lapped a few large gas project deployments and have been negatively impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. the test application also experienced organic revenue decline during the year driven by negative impacts from the covid-19 pandemic across most major geographic regions, and the lapping of a couple large prior year project executions in the middle east. the software as a service ("saas") application had a modest decline in revenue as compared to the prior year, primarily in the u.s.
orders/backlog an order represents a legally enforceable, written document that includes the scope of work or services to be performed or equipment to be supplied to a customer, the corresponding price and the expected delivery date for the applicable products or services to be provided. an order often takes the form of a customer purchase order or a signed quote from a xylem business. orders received during 2020 decreased by $306 million, or 5.7%, to $5,033 million (5.4% decrease on a constant currency basis). order intake during the year was negatively impacted by $18 million of foreign currency translation. the order decline on a constant currency basis primarily consisted of organic order declines of $284 million, or 5.3%, over the prior year.

(a)foreign currency translation impact for the year primarily due to the weakening in value of various currencies against the u.s. dollar, the largest being the russian ruble, the norwegian krone, the brazilian real, the south african rand and the chilean peso. these impacts were partially offset by the strengthening of the euro during the year.
water infrastructure water infrastructure segment orders decreased $100 million, or 4.5%, to $2,134 million (3.6% decrease on a constant currency basis). order intake during the year was negatively impacted by $20 million of foreign currency translation, with the change at constant currency coming from organic order decline in the transport application, which was partially offset by growth in the treatment application during the year. the transport application experienced an organic order decline during the year, primarily driven by market weakness in construction, mining, and oil and gas impacting the dewatering application in north america, along with the lapping of a large project order in india in the prior year. organic growth in the treatment application was primarily driven by strong order intake in north america. the covid-19 pandemic also negatively impacted organic order growth for the segment during the year.
applied water applied water segment orders decreased $73 million to $1,483 million, or 4.7%, as compared to the prior year and was not significantly impacted by foreign currency translation during the year. the order decrease was primarily driven by organic weakness across all end markets, primarily in the u.s. and, to a lesser extent, in the emerging markets and western europe. the organic order growth for the segment during the year was negatively impacted by the covid-19 pandemic.
measurement & control solutions measurement & control solutions segment orders decreased $133 million, or 8.6%, to $1,416 million (8.7% decrease on a constant currency basis). order intake during the year benefited from $2 million of foreign currency translation, with the change at constant currency driven by an organic decline of $131 million and, to a lesser extent, a $4 million reduction in orders related to divestiture impacts during the year. organic weakness during the year was driven by the water application, where we lapped prior year project orders and, to a lesser extent, the energy application, where prior year gas project deployments more than offset strong electric order intake during the year. the saas application also contributed to the organic decline during the year, driven by the lapping of large project orders in north america during the prior year. the test application also experienced a reduction in order intake during the year, primarily in the u.k and the u.s. the covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted the organic order growth during the year.
backlog backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period. delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements. annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts. as such, beginning total backlog, plus orders, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors. typically, large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules and delays can occur from time to time. total backlog was $2,124 million at december 31, 2020 and $1,801 million at december 31, 2019, an increase of 17.9%. we anticipate that approximately 55% of our total backlog at december 31, 2020 will be recognized as revenue during 2021.
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased 150 basis points to 37.5% in 2020 as compared to 39.0% in 2019. the gross margin decrease for the year was primarily driven by cost inflation, increased quality management costs, unfavorable mix, unfavorable volume, impacted by covid-19, and other lesser impacts, which were partially offset by cost reductions from our global procurement and productivity improvement initiatives and price realization.

restructuring and asset impairment charges restructuring in response to the changes in business and economic conditions arising as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, on june 2, 2020 management committed to a restructuring plan that includes actions across our businesses and functions globally. the plan is designed to support our long-term financial resilience and simplify our operations, strengthen our competitive positioning and better serve our customers.
as a result of this action, during 2020, we recognized restructuring charges of $20 million, $4 million and $30 million in our water infrastructure, applied water and measurement & control solutions segments, respectively. these charges included reduction of headcount across all segments and asset impairments within our measurement & control solutions segment. immaterial restructuring charges incurred during the first quarter are included in the plan information presented below.
during 2019, we recognized restructuring costs of $20 million, $5 million and $28 million in our water infrastructure, applied water and measurement & control solutions, respectively. these charges were incurred primarily as a continuation of our efforts to reposition our european and north american businesses to optimize our cost structure
and improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness. the charges included the reduction of headcount and consolidation of facilities within our measurement & control solutions and water infrastructure segments, as well as headcount reductions within our applied water segment.

the water infrastructure, applied water, and measurement & control solutions actions commenced in 2020 consist primarily of severance charges in each of the segments and asset impairment charges in our measurement & control solutions segment. these actions are expected to continue through 2021. the water infrastructure, applied water, and measurement & control solutions actions commenced in 2019 consist primarily of severance charges. the actions commenced in 2019 are complete.
during the second quarter of 2020 the discontinuance of a product line resulted in $17 million of asset impairments, primarily related to customer relationships, trademarks and fixed assets within our measurement & control solutions segment.
these restructuring charges are primarily related to actions taken in response to the changes in business and economic conditions arising as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. as a result of the actions initiated in 2020, we achieved savings of approximately $22 million in 2020 and estimate annual future net savings beginning in 2021 of approximately $63 million, resulting in $41 million of incremental savings from 2020 actions asset impairment during the second and third quarters of 2020, we determined that certain assets within our measurement & control solutions segment, including software, proprietary technology, and internally developed in-process software, were impaired. accordingly we recognized impairment charges of $21 million during the year. refer to note 12, "goodwill and other intangible assets," for additional information.
during the first and third quarters of 2019, we determined that certain assets within our measurement & control solutions segment, including customer relationships, internally developed software, proprietary technology, and plant property & equipment, were impaired. accordingly we recognized impairment charges of $10 million during the year. refer to note 12, "goodwill and other intangible assets," for additional information.
goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of 2020, the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $58 million related to the aia goodwill reporting unit within our measurement & control solutions segment. the aia goodwill reporting unit is comprised of our assessment services business (primarily the pure acquisition) as well as our digital solutions business. the impairment resulted from management's updated forecast of future cash flows for the aia businesses, which reflects significant negative volume impacts, primarily on our assessment services business, due to travel restrictions and site closures as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. our ongoing investment in the aia businesses also continues to impact near-term profitability. these factors drove a decrease in the fair value, based on a discounted cash flow valuation, of the aia goodwill reporting unit that is below its carrying value as of the third quarter, requiring an impairment charge. refer to note 12, "goodwill and other intangible assets," for additional information.
during the third quarter of 2019, the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $148 million related to the aia goodwill reporting unit. the impairment resulted from a downward revision of forecasted future cash flows. factors that contributed to the revised forecast in the third quarter of 2019 included lower-than-expected results as compared to prior forecasts, largely as a result of slower-than-expected conversion of pipeline opportunities to revenue. additionally, we have continued to invest in the aia platform ahead of the adoption curve, which has also impacted the near-term profitability of the business. these factors drove a decrease in the fair value, based on a discounted cash flow valuation, of the aia goodwill reporting unit that was below its carrying value as of july 1, 2019, requiring an impairment charge. refer to note 12, "goodwill and other intangible assets," for additional information.
operating income operating income was $367 million (operating margin of 7.5%) during 2020, a decrease of $119 million, or 24.5%, when compared to operating income of $486 million (operating margin of 9.3%) during the prior year. operating margin benefited from decreases in special charges of $78 million and decreases in restructuring and realignment costs of $5 million as compared to the prior year. excluding these special charges and restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income was $525 million (adjusted operating margin of 10.8%) for 2020 as compared to adjusted operating income of $727 million (adjusted operating margin of 13.9%) during the prior year. the decrease in adjusted operating margin was primarily due to unfavorable volume, impacted significantly by covid-19; cost inflation; increased quality management costs; unfavorable mix and increased spending on strategic investments. these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our productivity, restructuring and other cost saving initiatives.

applied water operating income for our applied water segment decreased $36 million, or 14.9%, during 2020 as compared to the prior year, with operating margin also decreasing from 15.6% to 14.3%. operating margin benefited from a decrease in restructuring and realignment costs of $4 million in 2020. excluding these restructuring and realignment costs, adjusted operating income decreased $40 million, or 15.7%, with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 16.5% to 14.9%. the decrease in adjusted operating margin during the year was primarily due to cost inflation; unfavorable volume, impacted significantly by covid-19; increased inventory management costs and other lesser impacts. these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our productivity and other cost saving initiatives and price realization.
measurement & control solutions operating loss for our measurement & control solutions segment increased $39 million, or 58.2%, during 2020 as compared to the prior year, resulting in an operating loss of $106 million, with operating margin decreasing from (4.4)% to (7.8)%. operating margin benefited from a decrease in special charges of $80 million, which was slightly offset by increased restructuring and realignment costs of $2 million in 2020. excluding these items, adjusted operating income decreased $117 million, or 90.0%, with adjusted operating margin decreasing from 8.5% to 1.0%. the decrease in adjusted operating margin during the year was driven by unfavorable volume, impacted significantly by covid-19 related site-access restrictions and customer project delays; cost inflation; unfavorable mix, increased quality management costs, primarily due to warranty charges recorded during the the year; increased spending on strategic investments and other lesser impacts. these impacts were partially offset by cost reductions from our productivity and other cost saving initiatives and price realization.
corporate and other operating loss for corporate and other decreased $3 million, or 5.7%, compared to the prior year. the decrease in costs are the result of cost saving actions taken during the year.
interest expense interest expense was $77 million and $67 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. the increase in interest expense for both periods is primarily driven by the issuance of our green bond (as defined in "funding and liquidity strategy") during the second quarter of 2020. see note 15, "credit facilities and debt", of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt and related interest.
income tax expense the income tax provision for 2020 was $31 million at an effective tax rate of 10.9% as compared to $15 million at an effective tax rate of 3.7% in 2019. the 2020 effective tax rate differs from that of 2019 primarily due to the impact of the changes in tax law in switzerland in 2019 along with the impact of the larger goodwill impairment charge on income before taxes in 2019 as well as a reduction in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in 2020.
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash:
(in millions)                       2020   2019                                        change operating activities            $824                      $839                     $(15)

(a)2020 impact is primarily due to the strengthening of the euro, the chinese yuan and various other currencies against the u.s. dollar.
sources and uses of liquidity operating activities during 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $824 million, compared to $839 million in 2019. the $15 million year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in cash from earnings, partially offset by deferred payments, lower income tax payments, and improved working capital management.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $169 million in 2020, compared to $231 million in 2019. this decrease in cash used of $62 million was mainly driven by lower spending on capital expenditures compared to the prior year and a reduction in cash paid for acquisitions.
financing activities cash generated by financing activities was $473 million in 2020, compared to cash used of $177 million in 2019. the net increase in cash generated by financing activities during the year was primarily driven by the issuance of our green bond (as defined in "funding and liquidity strategy") and higher levels of short-term debt during the year, partially offset by the repayment of short-term debt during 2020 and an increase in share repurchase activity of $21 million.
funding and liquidity strategy our ability to fund our capital needs depends on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to bank financing and the capital markets. as a result of uncertainties caused by the covid-19 pandemic, we continually evaluated aspects of our spending, including capital expenditures, strategic investments and dividends throughout 2020. additionally, we committed to reducing our annual capital expenditures during the year. we will continue to evaluate aspects of our spending in 2021 and anticipate our capital expenditures will gradually begin to increase to normal levels during the year as the markets we operate in recover. in 2020, we elected to utilize certain federal, state and foreign tax programs related to timing of tax payments and deductions to further manage our liquidity, and the liabilities associated with these programs are appropriately classified in the applicable "accrued and other current liabilities" or "other non-current accrued liabilities" accounts in our consolidated balance sheets.
historically, we have generated operating cash flow sufficient to fund our primary cash needs. as the uncertainty and severity associated with the global spread of the covid-19 pandemic continued to grow throughout 2020, xylem issued senior notes of $1 billion in aggregate principal ("green bond") on june 26, 2020. the primary long-term intention of incurring this debt is to fund green projects across our business segments, as well as manage liquidity risk and increase flexibility, as the duration of the economic effects of the pandemic are uncertain. see note 15, "credit facilities and debt", of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt. xylem's liquidity position has continued to evolve favorably during 2020, and we will continue to monitor the economic effects of the covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the company's future operating cash flows going forward. if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect, we may need to incur debt or issue equity. from time to time, we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets, and (iii) the current state of the economy. there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all. our securities are rated investment grade. a significant change in credit rating could impact our ability to borrow at favorable rates. refer to note 15, "credit facilities and debt", of our consolidated financial statements for a description of limitations on obtaining additional funding.
we monitor our global funding requirements and seek to meet our liquidity needs on a cost-effective basis. as of december 31, 2020, the covid-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our borrowing costs or other costs of capital, however the future impact of the covid-19 pandemic is uncertain and may increase our borrowing costs and other costs of capital and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we have considered the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on our liquidity and capital resources and do not currently expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs or continue to comply with debt covenants. to provide for continued access to the full capacity of our credit facilities going forward, xylem entered into amendment no. 1 to the 2019 credit facility (as defined in note 15, "credit facilities and debt") on june 22, 2020 which modified the covenant calculation methodology through the quarter ending september 30, 2021 and restricts stock repurchases until march 31, 2021, except for shares of common stock in an amount not to exceed the number of shares issued after the date of the amendment, subject to customary exceptions. see note 15, "credit facilities and debt", of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt.
based on our current global cash positions, cash flows from operations and access to the capital markets, we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our funding requirements and service debt and other obligations in both the u.s. and outside of the u.s. over the next 12 months. in addition, we believe our existing committed credit facilities and access to the public debt markets would provide further liquidity if required. currently, we have available liquidity of approximately $2.7 billion, consisting of $1.9 billion of cash and $800 million of available credit facilities as disclosed in note 15, "credit facilities and debt", of our consolidated financial statements. our debt repayment obligations in 2021 consist of $600 million in senior notes which we expect to pay out of cash. our next long-term debt maturity is march 2023.
risk related to these items are described in our risk factor disclosures referenced under "item 1a. risk factors".
credit facilities & long-term contractual commitments see note 15, "credit facilities and debt" of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities and long-term debt.
non-u.s. operations for 2020 and 2019, we generated 53% and 51% of our revenue from non-u.s. operations, respectively. as we continue to grow our operations in the emerging markets and elsewhere outside of the u.s., we expect to continue to generate significant revenue from non-u.s. operations and expect that a substantial portion of our cash will be predominately held by our foreign subsidiaries. we expect to manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. we may transfer cash from certain international subsidiaries to the u.s. and other international subsidiaries when we believe it is cost-effective to do so. we continually review our domestic and foreign cash profile, expected future cash generation and investment opportunities and reassess whether there is a need to repatriate funds held internationally to support our u.s. operations. as of december 31, 2020, we have provided a deferred tax liability of $7 million for net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on $500 million of earnings expected to be repatriated to the u.s. parent as deemed necessary in the future.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december 31, 2020:
total commitments                                                    $875                     $878                       $187                     $2,451                     $4,391
in addition to the amounts presented in the table above, we have recorded liabilities for net investment hedges of $117 million and employee severance indemnities of $17 million. these amounts have been excluded from the contractual obligations table due to an inability to reasonably estimate the timing or amounts of such payments in individual years. further, benefit payments which reflect expected future service related to the company's pension and other post-retirement employee benefit obligations are presented in note 16, "post-retirement benefit plans" of the consolidated financial statements and deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions are presented in note 7, "income taxes" of the consolidated financial statements, and as such, these obligations are not included in the above table. finally, estimated environmental payments and workers' compensation and general liability reserves are excluded from the table above. we estimate, based on historical experience, that we will spend approximately $1 million to $2 million per year on environmental investigation and remediation and approximately $5 million to $6 million per year on workers' compensation and general liability. at december 31, 2020, we had estimated and accrued $3 million and $20 million related to environmental matters, and workers' compensation and general liability, respectively.
(1)refer to note 15, "credit facilities and debt," of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the use and availability of debt and revolving credit agreements. amounts represent principal payments of short-term and long-term debt including current maturities and exclude unamortized discounts.
(3)refer to note 11, "leases" of the consolidated financial statements for further lease discussion.
(4)represents unconditional purchase agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms to purchase goods or services, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase agreements that are able to cancel without penalty have been excluded.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2020, we have issued guarantees for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries in the normal course of business. we have determined that none of these arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements, financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
we obtain certain stand-by letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds from third-party financial institutions in the ordinary course of business when required under contracts or to satisfy insurance related requirements. as of december 31, 2020, the amount of surety bonds, bank guarantees, insurance letters of credit and stand-by letters of credit was $378 million.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," of the consolidated financial statements. accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain, involve significant judgments, include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used, and changes in the estimates that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
revenue recognition. xylem recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled for providing those goods and services. for each arrangement with a customer, we identify the contract and the associated performance obligations within the contract, determine the transaction price of that contract, allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognize revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
the satisfaction of performance obligations in a contract is based upon when the customer obtains control over the asset. depending on the nature of the performance obligation, control transfers either at a particular point in time, or over time which determines the recognition pattern of revenue.
for product sales, other than long-term construction-type contracts, we recognize revenue once control has passed at a point in time, which is generally when products are shipped. in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance, revenue is recognized when either (i) we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer-specified objective criteria or (ii) upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer-specified objective criteria. we recognize revenue on product sales to channel partners, including resellers, distributors or value-added solution providers, at the point in time when the risks and rewards, possession, and title have transferred to the customer, which usually occurs at the point of delivery.
revenue from performance obligations related to services is primarily recognized over time, as the performance obligations are satisfied. in these instances, the customer consumes the benefit of the service as xylem performs.
certain businesses also enter into long-term construction-type sales contracts where revenue is recognized over time. in these instances, revenue is recognized using a measure of progress that applies an input method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs. we also recognize revenue for certain of these arrangements using the output method and measure progress based on shipments of product where control has transferred to the customer.
for all contracts with customers, we determine the transaction price in the arrangement and allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract. judgment is required to determine the appropriate unit of account, and we separate out the performance obligations if they are capable of being distinct and are distinct within the context of the contract. the transaction price is adjusted for our estimate of variable consideration, which may include a right of return, discounts, rebates, penalties and retainage. to estimate variable consideration, we apply the expected value or the most likely amount method, based on whichever method most appropriately predicts the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to. the method applied is typically based on historical experience and known trends. we constrain the amounts of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price, to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when uncertainties around the variable consideration are resolved.
income taxes. deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse. based on the evaluation of available evidence, we recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits. we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback years and the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income. the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates.
due to the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act"), we have recorded net foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes on earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the u.s. parent. we have not recorded any deferred taxes on the amounts that the company currently does not intend to repatriate as the determination of any deferred taxes on this amount is not practicable.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. furthermore, we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities or upon completion of the litigation process, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional tax expense would result. if a payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
business combinations. we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. all of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration is recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. these assumptions and estimates include a market participant's use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and, when appropriate, includes assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms. significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the cost to build/recreate certain technology, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. in addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.
goodwill and intangible assets. we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. we also review the carrying value of our finite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise. we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter. for goodwill, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for that excess up to the amount of recorded goodwill. we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach. we estimate the fair value of our intangible assets with indefinite lives using either the income approach or the market approach. under the income approach, we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. under the market approach, we calculate fair value based on recent sales and selling prices of similar assets.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, particularly related to future operating results and cash flows. these estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates, future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data. in addition, the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also require judgment. goodwill is tested for impairment at either the operating segment identified in note 22, "segment and geographic data," of the consolidated financial statements, or one level below. the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions. actual future results may differ from those estimates.
in the third quarter of 2020, management updated forecasts of future cash flows for the aia businesses, which reflect significant negative volume impacts from the covid-19 pandemic, primarily on our assessment services business. our ongoing investment in the aia businesses also continues to impact near term profitability. based on these factors we determined that there were indicators that the aia reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired, and accordingly, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of july 1, 2020. the results of the impairment test showed that the fair value of the aia reporting unit was lower than the carrying value, resulting in a $58 million goodwill impairment charge. as of december 31, 2020 the remaining goodwill balance in our aia reporting unit after recording the goodwill impairment charge was $113 million.
also, during the third quarter of 2020, due to the factors discussed above, we assessed whether the carrying amounts of the aia reporting unit's long-lived assets may not be recoverable and therefore impaired. our assessment resulted in an impairment charge of $11 million, primarily related to software and proprietary technology. the charge was calculated using an income approach.
the uncertainty of the future impact of the covid-19 pandemic may also contribute to further deterioration of our future cash flows. if we do not achieve our forecasts it is possible that the goodwill of the aia reporting unit could be deemed to be impaired again in a future period. the risks and potential impacts of covid-19 on the fair value of our assets are included in our risk factor disclosures referenced under "item 1a. risk factors".
during the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed our annual impairment assessment and determined that the estimated fair values of our goodwill reporting units were substantially in excess of each of their carrying values. however, future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. we will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances require us to do so. we determined that no impairment of the indefinite-lived intangibles existed as of the measurement date in 2020. however, future indefinite-lived intangible impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. we will continue to evaluate indefinite-lived intangibles on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment.
post-retirement benefit plans. company employees around the world participate in numerous defined benefit plans. the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to these plans are dependent on various assumptions. these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, years of service and other factors (some of which are disclosed in note 16, "post-retirement benefit plans," of the consolidated financial statements). actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized on a straight-line basis only to the extent they exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value or projected benefit obligation, over the average remaining service period of active plan participants, or for plans with all or substantially all inactive participants, over the average remaining life expectancy.
significant assumptions management develops each assumption using relevant company experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each individual country in which such plans exist. all assumptions are reviewed annually with third-party consultants and are adjusted as necessary. the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate our defined benefit pension obligations and costs as of and for the years ended 2020 and 2019.

nm    not meaningful. the pension benefits for future service for all the u.s. pension plans are based on years of service and not impacted by future compensation increases.
we determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. specifically, the company analyzes the estimated future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns and evaluates historical broad market returns over long-term timeframes based on the strategic asset allocation, which is detailed in note 16, "post-retirement benefit plans," of the consolidated financial statements.
based on the approach described above, the chart below shows weighted average actual returns versus the weighted average expected long-term rates of return for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year.
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets            3.46   %                7.09   %
actual rate of return on plan assets                       14.06   %               12.59   %
for the recognition of net periodic pension cost, the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived by applying the expected long-term rate of return to the market-related value of plan assets. the market-related value of plan assets is based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years. the use of fair value, rather than a calculated value, could materially affect net periodic pension cost. the weighted average expected long-term rate of return for all of our plan assets to be used in determining net periodic benefit costs for 2021 is estimated at 3.24%. we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the expected return on plan assets impacts the expense by $1 million.
the discount rate reflects our expectation of the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date. a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaa/aa bonds, with maturities between zero and 30 years, developed by the plan's actuaries. annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single-point discount rate matching the plan's characteristics. our weighted average discount rate for all pension plans effective january 1, 2021, is 1.21%. we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the expense by $2 million.
the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future and near-term outlook. effective january 1, 2021, our expected rate of future compensation is 2.91% for all pension plans. the estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of future compensation is less than $1 million.
the company has initiated the process for a full buy-out of its largest defined benefit plan in the uk. upon completion of the buy-out, expected in 2021, we expect a material settlement charge primarily consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses.
we currently anticipate making contributions to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans in the range of $19 million to $27 million during 2021. we also anticipate an estimated payment of approximately $15-$17 million for the buy-out of the uk pension plan. approximately $6 million of contributions are expected to be made in the first quarter.
funded status funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets. we estimate that every 25 basis point change in the discount rate impacts the funded status by approximately $42 million.
fair value of plan assets the plan assets of our pension plans comprise a broad range of investments, including domestic and foreign equity securities, interests in hedge funds, fixed income investments, insurance contracts, and cash and cash equivalents.
a portion of our pension benefit plan assets portfolio comprises investments in hedge funds which are generally measured at net asset value. however, in certain instances, the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date. accordingly, we made estimate adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date. these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers, as well as general market information. the adjustment recorded at december 31, 2020 and 2019 for these assets represented less than one percent of total plan assets in each respective year. asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices. we estimate that a 5% change in asset values will impact funded status by approximately $32 million.

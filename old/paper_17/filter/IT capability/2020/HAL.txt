table of contents management's report on internal control over financial reporting the management of halliburton company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in the securities exchange act rule 13a-15(f).
internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2020 based upon criteria set forth in the internal control - integrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.
based on our assessment, we believe that, as of december 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. the effectiveness of halliburton's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2020 has been audited by kpmg llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report that is included herein.
table of contents report of independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders and board of directors halliburton company:
opinion on the consolidated financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of halliburton company and subsidiaries (the company)
as of december 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of december 31, 2020
and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended december 31, 2020, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2020, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission, and our report dated february 5, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.
change in accounting principle as discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of january 1, 2019 due to the adoption of accounting standards codification topic 842, leases.
basis for opinion these consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)
relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets as discussed in notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized, which is dependent upon the generation of the future taxable income. as of december 31,
2020, the company had gross deferred tax assets of $3.8 billion and a related valuation allowance of $1.4 billion.
table of contents carryforwards and foreign tax credits, required subjective auditor judgment to assess the forecasts of future taxable income over the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. changes in assumptions regarding forecasted taxable income, specifically revenue growth rates, could have an impact on the company's evaluation of the realizability of the domestic deferred tax assets.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter.
this included controls related to the development of forecasts of future taxable income. we evaluated the assumptions used in the development of forecasts of future taxable income, specifically revenue growth rates, by comparing to historical actuals while considering current and anticipated future commodity prices or market events.
we also evaluated the company's history of realizing domestic deferred tax assets by evaluating the expiration of domestic net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits.
assessment of the fair value of property, plant and equipment as discussed in notes 1, 2, and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the gross amount of property, plant and equipment as of december 31, 2020 was $15.4 billion and related accumulated depreciation was $11.0 billion. when events or changes in circumstances indicate that long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation is performed. the company compares estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. if the asset group's undiscounted cash flows are less than their carrying amount, then they determine the asset group's fair value. the fair value of an asset group is determined by using a discounted cash flow analysis, and an impairment is recognized in the event the fair value is less than the carrying value. the company recognized an impairment charge of $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31,
we identified the assessment of the company's estimate of the fair value of property, plant and equipment as a critical audit matter for certain asset groups. there was a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the significant assumptions used in determining the discounted cash flows used to estimate the fair value of certain asset groups, specifically the revenue growth rates, expected profitability margin and the discount rate used.
the following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the company's process to estimate the discounted cash flows of certain asset groups, including controls related to the significant assumptions. we evaluated the company's development of the revenue growth rates and expected profitability margin assumptions by identifying and assessing the sources of data that management used in their assessment. we evaluated the revenue growth rates and expected profitability margin for consistency with relevant historical data, changes in the business, and external industry data, as applicable. in addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist with evaluating the selected discount rate by comparing it against a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable companies.
/s/ kpmg llp we have served as the company's auditor since 2002.

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements halliburton company notes to consolidated financial statements note 1. description of company and significant accounting policies description of company halliburton company is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. its predecessor was established in 1919 and incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in 1924. we help our customers maximize asset value throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production throughout the life of the asset. we serve major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies throughout the world and operate under twodivisions, which form the basis for the twooperating segments we report, the completion and production segment and the drilling and evaluation segment.
use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles, requiring us to make estimates and assumptions that affect:
- the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and
we believe the most significant estimates and assumptions are associated with the forecasting of our income tax
(provision) benefit and the valuation of deferred taxes, legal reserves, long-lived asset valuations, and allowance for credit losses. ultimate results could differ from our estimates.
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and all of our subsidiaries that we control or variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. all material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. investments in companies in which we do not have a controlling interest, but over which we do exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. if we do not have significant influence, we use the cost method of accounting. in addition, certain reclassifications of prior period balances have been made to conform to the current period presentation.
revenue recognition our services and products are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with our customers that include fixed or determinable prices but do not include right of return provisions or other significant post-
delivery obligations. the vast majority of our service and product contracts are short-term in nature. we recognize revenue based on the transfer of control or our customers' ability to benefit from our services and products in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services and products. we also assess our customers' ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including our historical payment experience with, and the financial condition of our customers. rates for services are typically priced on a per day, per meter, per man-hour, or similar basis.see note 4 for further information on revenue recognition.
research and development we maintain an active research and development program. the program improves products, processes, and engineering standards and practices that serve the changing needs of our customers, such as those related to high pressure and high temperature environments, and also develops new products and processes. research and development costs are expensed as incurred and were $ 309million in 2020, $ 404million in 2019, and $ 390million in 2018.
cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three monthsor less to be cash equivalents.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. cost represents invoice or production cost for new items and original cost. production cost includes material, labor, and manufacturing overhead. our inventory is recorded on the weighted average cost method. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage, estimated product demand, and technological developments.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses we establish an allowance for credit losses through a review of several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and current financial condition of our customers. losses are charged against the allowance when the customer accounts are determined to be uncollectible.
property, plant and equipment other than those assets that have been written down to their fair values due to impairment, property, plant, and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation, which is generally provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. accelerated depreciation methods are often used for tax purposes, when permitted. upon sale or retirement of an asset, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized. planned major maintenance costs are generally expensed as incurred. expenditures for additions, modifications, and conversions are capitalized when they increase the value or extend the useful life of the asset.
goodwill and other intangible assets we record as goodwill the excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business acquisition. changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are detailed below by reportable segment.

the reported amounts of goodwill for each reporting unit are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, during the third quarter, and more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. as a result of our goodwill impairment assessments performed in the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net book value and, therefore, nogoodwill impairments were deemed necessary.for further information on our goodwill impairment assessments, see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting estimates."
we amortize other identifiable intangible assets with a finite life on a straight-line basis over the period which the asset is expected to contribute to our future cash flows, ranging from one yearto twenty-eight years. the components of these other intangible assets generally consist of patents, license agreements, non-compete agreements, trademarks, and customer lists and contracts.
evaluating impairment of long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that long-lived assets other than goodwill may be impaired, an evaluation is performed. for assets classified as held for use, we first group individual assets based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets. we then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. if the asset group's undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis and recognize any resulting impairment. when an asset is classified as held for sale, the asset's book value is evaluated and adjusted to the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. in addition, depreciation and amortization is ceased while it is classified as held for sale.see note 2 for further information on impairments and other charges recorded in 2020.
income taxes we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances.
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on continuing operations in our consolidated statements of operations.
derivative instruments at times, we enter into derivative financial transactions to hedge existing or projected exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value and reflected through the results of operations. if the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against:
- the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings; or
- recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
the ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is recognized in earnings. recognized gains or losses on derivatives entered into to manage foreign currency exchange risk are included in "other, net" on the consolidated statements of operations. gains or losses on interest rate derivatives are included in "interest expense, net."
foreign currency translation foreign entities whose functional currency is the united states dollar translate monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and nonmonetary items are translated at historical rates. revenue and expense transactions are translated at the average rates in effect during the year, except for those expenses associated with nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are translated at historical rates. gains or losses from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities due to changes in exchange rates are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in "other, net" in the year of occurrence.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employee's service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. additionally, compensation cost is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest, therefore, we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures.see note 13 for additional information related to stock-based compensation.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements note 2. impairments and other charges the oil and gas industry experienced an unprecedented disruption during 2020 as a result of a combination of factors, including the substantial decline in global demand for oil caused by the covid-19 pandemic and subsequent mitigation efforts. this disruption created a substantial surplus of oil and a decline in oil prices. west texas intermediate (wti) oil spot prices decreased during the first quarter of 2020 from a high of $ 63per barrel in early january of 2020 to approximately $ 21per barrel by the end of the first quarter of 2020. although oil prices recovered moderately to approximately $ 48per barrel by the end of december 2020, wti oil spot prices averaged approximately $ 43per barrel during the fourth quarter of 2020 and $ 39per barrel during the year 2020, which was approximately 25% and 31%, respectively, less than the average price per barrel during the same periods in 2019. as a result, oil and gas activity declined significantly during 2020, with the global rig count sinking to the lowest level since 1973. the u.s. and international average rig counts dropped 54% and 25%, respectively, during 2020, contributing to a global rig count decline of 38% since december 31, 2019. in the first and second quarters of
2020, we determined these events constituted triggering events that required us to review the recoverability of our long-lived assets and perform an interim goodwill impairment assessment as of march 31, 2020 and may 1, 2020.
we determined the fair value of our long-lived assets based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with the exception of real estate facilities which are classified as held for sale for which fair value was based on third party sales price estimates. we determined the fair value for each reporting unit in our goodwill impairment assessment using both a discounted cash flow analysis and a multiples-based market approach for comparable companies. given the current volatile market environment, we utilized third-party valuation advisors to assist us with these valuations.
these analyses included significant judgment, including management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, revenue growth rates, profitability margins, capital expenditures, the timing of future cash flows based on an eventual recovery of the oil and gas industry, and in the case of long-lived assets, the remaining useful life and service potential of the asset. these impairment assessments incorporate inherent uncertainties, including projected commodity pricing, supply and demand for our services and future market conditions, which are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts. based upon our impairment assessments, we determined the carrying amount of some of our long-lived assets exceeded their respective fair values. as a result of our goodwill impairment assessments, we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net book value and, therefore, nogoodwill impairments were deemed necessary.
as a result of the events described above, we recorded impairments and other charges of approximately $ 3.8billion during the year ended december 31, 2020. the following table presents various pre-tax charges we recorded during the years ended december 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 which are reflected within "impairments and other charges" on our consolidated statements of operations.

of the $ 3.8billion of impairments and other charges recorded during the year ended december 31, 2020, approximately $ 2.4billion was attributable to our completion and production segment and approximately $ 1.4billion was attributable to our drilling and evaluation segment. long-lived asset impairments include impairments of property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and real estate facilities. the $ 2.6billion of long-lived asset impairments during 2020 consisted of the following: $ 1.0billion attributable to hydraulic fracturing equipment, the majority of which was located in north america; $ 297million related to drilling-related services equipment; $
191million related to right-of-use assets, primarily operating leases; $ 131million related to intangible assets;
and $ 394million associated with other fixed asset impairments. also included in long-lived asset impairments is $
616million related to real estate properties, primarily related to a fair value adjustment for a contemplated structured transaction for most of our remaining north america real estate owned assets classified as held for sale, and to approximately 50% of north american facilities being closed, sold, consolidated, or reduced in size during 2020.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2019, the $ 1.6billion of long-lived asset impairments consisted of the following:
$ 759million attributable to hydraulic fracturing equipment, the majority of which was located in north america; $
243million related to legacy drilling equipment; $ 215million related to real estate owned and classified as held for sale; $ 139million related to right-of-use assets associated with operating leases; $ 98million related to intangible assets; and $ 148million of other fixed asset impairments. we also rationalized our portfolio of existing joint ventures and recorded resulting charges within "joint ventures" in the table above.
inventory costs and write-downs in the table above primarily represent disposal of excess inventory, including drilling fluids and other chemicals, and write-downs in which some of our inventory cost exceeded its market value.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, the $ 265million impairment related to a write-down of all of our remaining investment in venezuela.
given the dynamic nature of the covid-19 pandemic and related market conditions, we cannot reasonably estimate the period that these events will persist or the full extent of the impact they will have on our business. if market conditions continue to deteriorate, including crude oil prices further declining or remaining at low levels for a sustained period, we may record further asset impairments, which may include an impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill.
note 3. business segment and geographic information we operate under twodivisions, which form the basis for the twooperating segments we report: the completion and production segment and the drilling and evaluation segment. our equity in earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting are included within cost of services and cost of sales on our statements of operations, which is part of operating income of the applicable segment.

operations by geographic region the following tables present information by geographic area. in 2020, 2019, and 2018, based on the location of services provided and products sold, 38%, 51%, and 58%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the united states. no other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue or property, plant, and equipment during the periods presented. as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019, 49% and 59% of our property, plant, and equipment was located in the united states.
note 4. revenue revenue is recognized based on the transfer of control or our customers' ability to benefit from our services and products in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those services and products. the vast majority of our service and product contracts are short-term in nature. in recognizing revenue for our services and products, we determine the transaction price of purchase orders or contracts with our customers, which may consist of fixed and variable consideration. we also assess our customers' ability and intention to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including our historical payment experience with, and the financial condition of our customers. payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 20to 60 days. other judgments involved in recognizing revenue include an assessment of progress towards completion of performance obligations for certain long-term contracts, which involve estimating total costs to determine our progress towards contract completion, and calculating the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize.
disaggregation of revenue we disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers into types of services or products, consistent with our tworeportable segments, in addition to geographical area. based on the location of services provided and products sold, 38%, 51%, and 58% of our consolidated revenue was from the united states for the years ended december 31,
2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. no other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. the following table presents information on our disaggregated revenue.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements year ended december 31
drilling and evaluation                              6,606        8,377        8,022
contract balances we perform our obligations under contracts with our customers by transferring services and products in exchange for consideration. the timing of our performance often differs from the timing of our customer's payment, which results in the recognition of receivables and deferred revenue. deferred revenue represents advance consideration received from customers for contracts where revenue is recognized on future performance of service. deferred revenue, as well as revenue recognized during the period relating to amounts included as deferred revenue at the beginning of the period, was not material to our consolidated financial statements.
transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations remaining performance obligations represent firm contracts for which work has not been performed and future revenue recognition is expected. we have elected the practical expedient permitting the exclusion of disclosing remaining performance obligations for contracts that have an original expected duration of one yearor less. we have some long-term contracts related to software and integrated project management services such as lump sum turnkey contracts. for software contracts, revenue is generally recognized over time throughout the license period when the software is considered to be a right to access our intellectual property. for lump sum turnkey projects, we recognize revenue over time using an input method, which requires us to exercise judgment. revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations for these long-term contracts is not material.
note 5. receivables as of december 31, 2020, 32% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the united states. as of december
31, 2019, 36% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the united states. noother country or single customer accounted for more than 10% of our net trade receivables at these dates.
we routinely monitor the financial stability of our customers and employ an extensive process to evaluate the collectability of outstanding receivables. this process, which involves judgment utilizing significant assumptions, includes analysis of our customers' historical time to pay, financial condition and various financial metrics, debt structure, credit agency ratings, and production profile, as well as political and economic factors in countries of operations and other customer-specific factors.

table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements note 6. leases we adopted a comprehensive new lease accounting standard effective january 1, 2019. the details of the significant changes to our accounting policies resulting from the adoption of the new standard are set out below. we adopted the standard using the optional modified retrospective transition method; accordingly, the comparative information as of december 31, 2018 and for the year ended december 31, 2018 has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under the previous lease standard. under the new lease standard, assets and liabilities that arise from all leases are required to be recognized on the balance sheet for lessees. previously, only capital leases, which are now referred to as finance leases, were recorded on the balance sheet. the adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of approximately $1.0 billion of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1, 2019. the adoption of this standard did not materially impact our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2019.
beginning january 1, 2019, for all leases with a term in excess of 12 months, we recognized a lease liability equal to the present value of the lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. for operating leases, lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and accretion of the lease liability, while finance leases include both an operating expense and an interest expense component. for all leases with a term of 12 months or less, we elected the practical expedient to not recognize lease assets and liabilities. we recognize lease expense for these short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
we are a lessee for numerous operating leases, primarily related to real estate, transportation, and equipment. the vast majority of our operating leases have remaining lease terms of 10years or less, some of which include options to extend the leases, and some of which include options to terminate the leases. we generally do not include renewal or termination options in our assessment of the leases unless extension or termination for certain assets is deemed to be reasonably certain. the accounting for some of our leases may require judgment, which includes determining whether a contract contains a lease, determining the incremental borrowing rates to utilize in our net present value calculation of lease payments for lease agreements which do not provide an implicit rate, and assessing the likelihood of renewal or termination options. we also have some lease agreements with lease and non-
lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single lease component. for certain equipment leases, such as offshore vessels and drilling rigs, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately.
the following tables illustrate the financial impact of our leases as of and for the years ended december 31, 2020
and december 31, 2019, along with other supplemental information about our existing leases:

subsequently, on march 5, 2020, we completed a tender offer to purchase $ 1.5billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes using proceeds from the debt issuance and cash on hand. in the tender offer, we purchased $ 500million aggregate principal amount of our 3.50% senior notes due august 2023 and $ 1.0billion aggregate principal amount of our 3.80% senior notes due november 2025. this early debt repurchase resulted in a $ 168million loss on extinguishment, which included a tender premium, unamortized discounts and costs on the retired notes, and other tender fees. these costs are included in "loss on early extinguishment of debt" on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31, 2020.
senior debt the $ 1.0billion of senior notes issued in march rank equally with our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, have semiannual interest payments and have no sinking fund requirements. we may redeem all of our senior notes from time to time or all of the notes of each series at any time at the applicable redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest.our 6.75% notes due february 2027, 7.6% senior debentures due august 2096 and

guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business, we have agreements with financial institutions under which approximately $
1.9billion of letters of credit, bank guarantees, or surety bonds were outstanding as of december 31, 2020. some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization. none of these off balance sheet arrangements either has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

operations during the year ended december 31, 2020, we recorded a total income tax benefit of $ 278million on a pre-tax loss of $ 3.2billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 8.6%. the effective tax rate for 2020 was primarily impacted by our geographic mix of earnings, tax adjustments related to the reassessment of prior year tax accruals and valuation allowances on some of our deferred tax assets. the increase in our valuation allowances results from our decreased forecasted ability to generate sufficient taxable income before the expiration of foreign tax credits and net operating losses as a direct result of deteriorated market conditions that led to impairment charges of $
3.8billion in 2020 and $ 2.5billion in 2019. see note 2 for further information.
the primary components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

during the year ended december 31, 2020, we increased our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $
312million related to $ 16million associated with foreign deferred tax assets and $ 296million associated with foreign tax credits.
in accordance with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, a company's foreign earnings accumulated under the legacy tax laws are deemed to be repatriated into the united states. we have provided federal and state income tax related to this deemed repatriation. we have not provided incremental united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2020. the company generally does not provide for taxes related to its undistributed earnings because such earnings either would not be taxable when remitted or they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

(b) includes $ 17million that could be resolved within the next 12 months.
our tax returns are subject to review by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we file tax returns. in most cases we are no longer subject to examination by tax authorities for years before 2009. the only significant operating jurisdiction that has tax filings under review or subject to examination by the tax authorities is the united states. the united states federal income tax filings for tax years 2016 through 2019 are currently under review or remain open for review by the u.s. internal revenue service.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements note 12. shareholders' equity shares of common stock the following table summarizes total shares of common stock outstanding:
our board of directors has authorized a program to repurchase a specified dollar amount of our common stock from time to time. the program does not require a specific number of shares to be purchased and the program may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the market or in privately negotiated transactions. the program may be terminated or suspended at any time. during the year ended december 31, 2020 we repurchased approximately 7.4million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $ 100million. there were 4.5million repurchases made under the program during the year ended december 31, 2019. approximately $ 5.1billion remained authorized for repurchases as of december 31, 2020. from the inception of this program in february 2006 through december 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 224million shares of our common stock for a total cost of approximately $ 9.0billion.
paid-in capital in excess of par value during 2020, we issued common stock from treasury shares under our employee stock purchase plan awards and for restricted stock grants. as a result, additional paid in capital was reduced below zero, which resulted in a reduction of retained earnings by $ 75million. additional issuances from treasury shares could similarly impact additional paid in capital and retained earnings.

table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements our stock and incentive plan, as amended (stock plan), provides for the grant of any or all of the following types of stock-based awards:
- stock options, including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options;
- restricted stock unit awards;
- stock value equivalent awards.
there are currently no stock appreciation rights, stock value equivalent awards, or incentive stock options outstanding. under the terms of the stock plan, approximately 247million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to employees and non-employee directors. at december 31, 2020, approximately 23million shares were available for future grants under the stock plan. the stock to be offered pursuant to the grant of an award under the stock plan may be authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares.
in addition to the provisions of the stock plan, we also have stock-based compensation provisions under the restricted stock plan for non-employee directors and the employee stock purchase plan (espp).
stock options the majority of our options are generally issued during the second quarter of the year. all stock options under the stock plan are granted at the fair market value of our common stock at the grant date. employee stock options generally vest ratably over a period of three yearsand expire 10years from the grant date. compensation expense for stock options is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the entire vesting period.

of option restricted stock restricted shares issued under the stock plan are restricted as to sale or disposition. these restrictions lapse periodically generally over a period of five years. restrictions may also lapse for early retirement and other conditions in accordance with our established policies. upon termination of employment, shares on which restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to us, resulting in restricted stock forfeitures. the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant is amortized and charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
in 2020, we also granted performance based restricted stock units, with the actual number of shares earned to be determined at the end of a three year performance period based on our achievement of certain predefined targets.
these targets are based upon our average return on capital employed as compared to certain competitors and a modifier based upon stock performance compared to the oilfield services index (osx). a monte carlo simulation that uses a probabilistic approach was performed by an actuary to measure grant date fair value. the fair value of these performance based restricted stock units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the three year performance cycle.
the following table represents our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted, vested, and forfeited during 2020.

the weighted average grant-date fair value of shares granted was $ 16.53during 2020, $ 24.75during 2019, and $
47.43during 2018. the total fair value of shares vested was $ 79million during 2020, $ 107million during 2019, and
$ 219million during 2018. as of december 31, 2020, there was $ 330million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of three years.
employee stock purchase plan under the espp, eligible employees may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld, subject to some limitations, to be used to purchase shares of our common stock. the espp contains fourthree-month offering periods commencing on january 1, april 1, july 1 and october 1 of each year. the price at which common stock may be purchased under the espp is equal to 90% (85% for 2019 and 2018) of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date or last trading day of each offering period. under the espp, 74million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance, of which 65million shares have been sold through the espp since the inception of the plan through december 31, 2020 and 9million shares are available for future issuance. the stock to be offered may be authorized but unissued common shares or treasury shares.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements the fair value of espp shares was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. the expected volatility was a one-year historical volatility of our common stock. the assumptions and resulting fair values were as follows:

per share note 14. income per share basic income or loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. diluted income per share includes additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. antidilutive securities represent potentially dilutive securities which are excluded from the computation of diluted income or loss per share as their impact was antidilutive.
a reconciliation of the number of shares used for the basic and diluted income per share computations is as follows:

note 15. financial instruments and risk management the carrying amount of cash and equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.
the carrying amount and fair value of our total debt, including short-term borrowings and current maturities of long term debt, is as follows:
of               1            2         fair        value       level 1            2          fair        value doll...                                  value                                                 value total    $  10,856    $     700    $  11,556    $   9,827    $   11,093    $     868    $   11,961    $  10,327
debt the total fair value of our debt decreased during 2020, primarily due to the early repurchase of senior notes partially offset by lower average yields. see note 9 for further information.
our debt categorized within level 1 on the fair value hierarchy is calculated using quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities with transactions occurring on the last two daysof period-end. our debt categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy is calculated using significant observable inputs for similar liabilities where estimated values are determined from observable data points on our other bonds and on other similarly rated corporate debt or from observable data points of transactions occurring prior to two daysfrom period-end and adjusting for changes in market conditions. differences between the periods presented in our level 1
and level 2 classification of our long-term debt relate to the timing of when transactions are executed. we have nodebt categorized within level 3 on the fair value hierarchy based on unobservable inputs.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options and interest rate swaps. the objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. the fair value of our forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps was not material as of december 31, 2020 or december 31, 2019. the counterparties to our derivatives are primarily global commercial and investment banks.
foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in many international locations and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar, our functional currency, which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.
techniques in managing foreign currency exchange risk include, but are not limited to, foreign currency borrowing and investing, and the use of currency exchange instruments. we attempt to selectively manage significant exposures to potential foreign currency exchange losses based on current market conditions, future operating activities, and the associated cost in relation to the perceived risk of loss. the purpose of our foreign currency risk management activities is to minimize the risk that our cash flows from the purchase and sale of products and services in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
we use forward contracts and options to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the currencies of certain countries in which we do business internationally. these instruments are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes, generally have an expiration date of one yearor less, and are not exchange traded. while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, the fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being managed. the use of some of these instruments may limit our ability to benefit from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
derivatives are not utilized to manage exposures in some currencies due primarily to the lack of available markets or cost considerations (non-traded currencies). we attempt to manage our working capital position to minimize foreign currency exposure in non-traded currencies and recognize that pricing for the services and products offered in these countries should account for the cost of exchange rate devaluations. we have historically incurred transaction losses in non-traded currencies.
the notional amounts of open foreign exchange derivatives were $ 817million at december 31, 2020 and $ 513million at december 31, 2019. the notional amounts of these instruments do not generally represent amounts exchanged by the parties, and thus are not a measure of our exposure or of the cash requirements related to these contracts. the fair value of our foreign exchange derivatives as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019 is included in "other current assets" in our consolidated balance sheets and was immaterial. the fair value of these instruments is categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy and was determined using a market approach with certain inputs, such as notional amounts hedged, exchange rates, and other terms of the contracts that are observable in the market or can be derived from or corroborated by observable data.
9.8billion at december 31, 2020 and $ 10.3billion at december 31, 2019. we maintain an interest rate management strategy that is intended to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates in the aggregate for our debt portfolio. we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating libor-
based rates. our interest rate swaps, which expire when the underlying debt matures, are designated as fair value hedges of the underlying debt and are determined to be highly effective. these derivative instruments are marked to market with gains and losses recognized currently in interest expense to offset the respective gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of the hedged debt.
as of december 31, 2020, we had an interest rate swap relating to one of our debt instruments with a total notional amount of $ 100million. the fair value of this interest rate swap as of december 31, 2020 and december 31, 2019 is included in "other assets" in our consolidated balance sheets and was immaterial. the fair value of this interest rate swap is categorized within level 2 on the fair value hierarchy and was determined using a market approach with inputs, such as the notional amount, libor rate spread, and settlement terms that are observable in the market or can be derived from or corroborated by observable data.
table of contents    item 8 | notes to consolidated financial statements credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash equivalents and trade receivables. it is our practice to place our cash equivalents in high quality investments with various institutions. our trade receivables are from a broad and diverse group of customers and are generally not collateralized. as of december 31, 2020, 32% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the united states.
as of december 31, 2019, 36% of our net trade receivables were from customers in the united states. we maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon several factors, including historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts and financial condition of our customers. see note 5 for further information.
we do not have any significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty to our derivative contracts. we select counterparties to those contracts based on our belief that each counterparty's profitability, balance sheet, and capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is unlikely to be materially adversely affected by foreseeable events.
note 16. retirement plans our company and subsidiaries have various plans that cover a significant number of our employees. these plans include defined contribution plans, defined benefit plans, and other postretirement plans:
- our defined contribution plans provide retirement benefits in return for services rendered. these plans provide an individual account for each participant and have terms that specify how contributions to the participant's account are to be determined rather than the amount of pension benefits the participant is to receive.
contributions to these plans are based on a percentage of pre-tax income, after-tax income, or discretionary amounts determined on an annual basis. our expense for the defined contribution plans totaled $ 100million in 2020,
$ 206million in 2019, and $ 193million in 2018. the decrease in expense from 2019 to 2020 was due to significant headcount reductions during the year ended december 31, 2020, coupled with the suspension of discretionary contributions in 2020.
- our defined benefit plans, which include both funded and unfunded pension plans, define an amount of pension benefit to be provided, usually as a function of age, years of service and/or compensation. the unfunded obligations and net periodic benefit cost of our united states defined benefit plans were not material for the periods presented; and
- our postretirement plans other than pensions are offered to specific eligible employees. the accumulated benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost for these plans were not material for the periods presented.
funded status for our international pension plans, at december 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation was $ 1.2billion and the fair value of plan assets was $ 1.1billion, which resulted in an unfunded obligation of $ 152million. at december 31, 2019, the projected benefit obligation was $ 1.1billion and the fair value of plan assets was $
1.0billion, which resulted in an unfunded obligation of $ 111million. the accumulated benefit obligation for our international plans was $ 1.1billion at december 31, 2020 and $ 1.0billion at december 31, 2019.

item 7 | executive overview item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and combined financial statements included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" contained herein.
executive overview financial results we experienced challenging market dynamics in 2020 as we faced a global pandemic, record oil demand destruction, and an unprecedented downturn in the energy industry. despite these difficulties, we demonstrated resilience and a strong commitment to our execution culture. we delivered historic results across our key safety and service quality metrics and demonstrated our ability to generate competitive cash flow in different business environments. the following graph illustrates our revenue and operating margins for each operating segment over the past three years.
during 2020, we generated total company revenue of $14.4 billion, a 36% decrease from the $22.4 billion of revenue generated in 2019, with our completion and production (c&p) segment declining by 44% and our drilling and evaluation (d&e) segment declining by 21%. we reported a total company operating loss of approximately $2.4 billion in 2020 driven by $3.8 billion of impairments and other charges. this compares to operating loss of $448 million in 2019 that was driven by $2.5 billion of impairments and other charges. a significant decline in pressure pumping services in north america land during 2020 negatively impacted operating results.
our north america revenue declined 52% in 2020 compared to 2019, resulting from lower activity and pricing in north america land, primarily associated with reduced stimulation and well construction activity. while the u.s. land rig count recovered from its august 2020 low, it is still 60% below pre-pandemic levels. even without improved pricing, we took advantage of the recovery in completions and drilling activity in the fourth quarter of 2020 and delivered margin improvement, demonstrating the operating leverage from our cost reductions and service delivery improvements in north america.
internationally, revenue declined 17% in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by reduced activity for drilling and completions related services across all international regions. internationally, rig counts and customer spending declined more than 20%. despite this tough backdrop, we improved our overall international margin in 2020.
business outlook oil prices have returned to pre-pandemic levels. as oil demand recovers, we anticipate favorable market dynamics, with international short-cycle producers leading the activity recovery. our strategic priorities should continue to drive our success as markets around the world stabilize and begin to grow.
internationally, we expect activity recovery to vary widely across the regions, with both a cyclical and seasonal bottoming of activity expected in the first quarter. while the pace of recovery depends on demand improvement, the second half of 2021 could see an increase in international activity as compared to the second half of 2020. we have a strong presence in mature fields completions and interventions work, a number of resilient integrated contracts around the world, leverage to unconventional developments in latin america and the middle east, and opportunities in key active offshore areas. our new drilling technologies are penetrating the market and gaining customer confidence, and we have growth opportunities as we expand our production related businesses internationally. also, we have adopted digital solutions which help our customers reduce cost per barrel, improve economics, and increase efficiencies. our digital and other technology advances, geographic expansion of our products and services, along with continued discipline in cost management and cost efficiency, should achieve profitable returns-driven growth in international markets.
in north america, our focused approach to building a leaner and more profitable business allowed us to improve our operating margins and cash flows in 2020. activity has rebounded from its lows in 2020. completions activity in north america is expected to continue improving in the first half of 2021, as commodity prices remain supportive and customers complete their back log of drilled, but uncompleted wells. for the full year of 2021, provided that the impact of the pandemic moderates, economic activity continues to increase, and commodity prices remain strong, we believe that our customers will sustain activity in order to hold their production flat to 2020 exit levels, with completions spend expected to outpace drilling.
in 2021, we will focus on executing our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow. our service delivery improvements, structural cost reductions, deployment of digital and other technologies, and lower capital intensity are expected to deliver on both customers' expectations and shareholder objectives.
our operating performance and business outlook are described in more detail in "business environment and results of operations."
capital expenditures during 2020, our capital expenditures were approximately $728 million, a decrease of 52% from 2019, and were predominantly made in our sperry drilling, production enhancement, baroid, artificial lift, and wireline and perforating product service lines. we intend for our capital expenditures in 2021 to remain relatively flat at $750 million. our lower capital intensity, aided by technological innovation, should contribute to ongoing cash flow generation. we believe this level of spend will equip us to take advantage of an anticipated recovery in the market as 2021 unfolds.
financial markets, liquidity and capital resources we believe we have invested our cash balances conservatively and secured sufficient financing to help mitigate any near-term negative impact on our operations from adverse market conditions. as of december 31, 2020, we had $2.6 billion of cash and equivalents and $3.5 billion of available committed bank credit under our revolving credit facility which expires in 2024. we believe this provides us with sufficient liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. for additional information on market conditions, see "liquidity and capital resources" and "business environment and results of operations."
item 7 | liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2020, we had $2.6 billion of cash and equivalents, compared to $2.3 billion of cash and equivalents at december 31, 2019.
•cash flows from operating activities were $1.9 billion. this included a positive impact from the primary components of our working capital (receivables, inventories, and accounts payable) of a net $800 million, primarily associated with lower customer receivables, partially offset by approximately $350 million of severance payments.
•in march 2020, we executed two transactions resulting in a reduction of gross debt by $500 million. we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and used the net proceeds from issuance along with cash on hand to repurchase $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. inclusive of the tender premium and fees, these transactions resulted in a net payment of approximately $654 million.
•capital expenditures were $728 million.
•we repurchased approximately 7.4 million shares of our common stock in early march, largely before the significant decline in oil prices, under our share repurchase program, at a total cost of approximately $100 million.
future sources and uses of cash we manufacture most of our own equipment, which provides us with some flexibility to increase or decrease our capital expenditures based on market conditions. capital spending for 2021 is currently expected to be approximately $750 million. we believe this level of spend will allow us to invest in our key strategic areas. we will continue to maintain capital discipline, monitor the rapidly changing market dynamics, and adjust our capital spend accordingly. for additional information on capital expenditures, see "executive overview."
based on our market outlook, we reduced our quarterly dividend rate in the second quarter of 2020 from $0.18 per common share to $0.045 per common share and remained at this amount for the rest of 2020, reducing cash outflows by approximately $360 million in 2020. we will continue to maintain our focus on liquidity and review our quarterly dividend considering our priorities of future debt reduction and, as market conditions evolve, reinvesting in our business.
our board of directors has authorized a program to repurchase our common stock from time to time. approximately $5.1 billion remained authorized for repurchases as of december 31, 2020 and may be used for open market and other share purchases.
item 7 | liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities as of december 31, 2020:
other long-term liabilities (d)               26             -               -             -               -               -                26
(a)    represents principal amounts of long-term debt, including current maturities of debt, which excludes any unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts.
(c)    amounts in 2021 primarily represent certain purchase orders for goods and services utilized in the ordinary course of our business.
(d)    includes pension funding obligations. amounts for pension funding obligations, which include international plans and are based on assumptions that are subject to change, are only included for 2021 as we are currently not able to reasonably estimate our contributions for years after 2021.
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. therefore, gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. we had $355 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding penalties and interest, at december 31, 2020, of which we estimate $211 million may require a cash payment by us. we estimate that $193 million of the cash payment will not be settled within the next 12 months.
other factors affecting liquidity financial position in current market. as of december 31, 2020, we had $2.6 billion of cash and equivalents and $3.5 billion of available committed bank credit under our revolving credit facility. furthermore, we have no financial covenants or material adverse change provisions in our bank agreements, and our debt maturities extend over a long period of time. we believe our cash on hand, cash flows generated from operations, and our available credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market and our global cash needs, including capital expenditures, working capital investments, dividends, if any, debt repayment, and contingent liabilities.
guarantee agreements. in the normal course of business, we have agreements with financial institutions under which approximately $1.9 billion of letters of credit, bank guarantees, or surety bonds were outstanding as of december 31, 2020. some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization, however, none of these triggering events have occurred.
credit ratings. our credit ratings with standard & poor's (s&p) remain bbb+ for our long-term debt and a-2 for our short-term debt, with a negative outlook. our credit ratings with moody's investors service (moody's) remain baa1 for our long-term debt and p-2 for our short-term debt, with a negative outlook.
customer receivables. in line with industry practice, we bill our customers for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our customers delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay our invoices due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers' cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets, as well as unsettled political conditions. given the nature and significance of the pandemic and disruption in the oil and gas industry, we have experienced delayed customer payments and payment defaults associated with customer liquidity issues and bankruptcies. if our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
item 7 | business environment and results of operations business environment and results of operations we operate in more than 70 countries throughout the world to provide a comprehensive range of services and products to the energy industry. our revenue is generated from the sale of services and products to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide. the industry we serve is highly competitive with many substantial competitors in each segment of our business. in 2020, 2019, and 2018, based on the location of services provided and products sold, 38%, 51%, and 58%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from the united states. no other country accounted for more than 10% of our revenue.
operations in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, force majeure, war or other armed conflict, sanctions, expropriation or other governmental actions, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency exchange restrictions and highly inflationary currencies, as well as other geopolitical factors. we believe the geographic diversification of our business activities reduces the risk that an interruption of operations in any one country, other than the united states, would be materially adverse to our consolidated results of operations.
activity within our business segments is significantly impacted by spending on upstream exploration, development and production programs by our customers. also impacting our activity is the status of the global economy, which impacts oil and natural gas consumption. the covid-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate its effect have had a substantial negative impact on the global economy and demand for oil.
some of the more significant determinants of current and future spending levels of our customers are oil and natural gas prices and our customers' expectations about future prices, global oil supply and demand, completions intensity, the world economy, the availability of capital, government regulation, and global stability, which together drive worldwide drilling and completions activity. additionally, many of our customers in north america have shifted their strategy from production growth to operating within cash flow and generating returns. lower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets and lower rig count, while the opposite is usually true for higher oil and natural gas prices. our financial performance is therefore significantly affected by oil and natural gas prices and worldwide rig activity, which are summarized in the tables below.
the table below shows the average oil and natural gas prices for wti, united kingdom brent crude oil, and henry hub natural gas.
(1) oil price measured in dollars per barrel.(2) natural gas price measured in dollars per million british thermal units (btu), or mmbtu.
the historical average rig counts based on the weekly baker hughes rig count data were as follows:
item 7 | business environment and results of operations the oil and gas industry experienced an unprecedented disruption during 2020 as a result of a combination of factors, including the substantial decline in global demand for oil caused by the covid-19 pandemic and subsequent mitigation efforts. this disruption created a substantial surplus of oil and a decline in oil prices. west texas intermediate (wti) oil spot prices decreased during the first quarter of 2020 from a high of $63 per barrel in early january of 2020 to approximately $21 per barrel by the end of the first quarter of 2020. although oil prices recovered moderately to approximately $48 per barrel by the end of december 2020, wti oil spot prices averaged approximately $43 per barrel during the fourth quarter of 2020 and $39 per barrel during the year 2020, which was approximately 25% and 31%, respectively, less than the average price per barrel during the same periods in 2019. as a result, oil and gas activity declined significantly during 2020, with the global rig count sinking to the lowest level since 1973. the u.s. and international average rig counts dropped 54% and 25%, respectively, during 2020, contributing to a global rig count decline of 38% since 2019.
crude oil prices traded within a wide range during 2020. after averaging $63 a barrel in january 2020, brent prices fell to an average of $18 a barrel in april, the lowest monthly average price since february 1999. the low prices were the result of significant declines in oil consumption that caused a sharp rise in global oil inventories. however, brent prices increased through much of the rest of 2020 as rising oil demand and reduced production caused global oil inventories to fall. prices rose to a monthly average of $50 a barrel in december due to expectations of future economic recovery based on the roll out of multiple covid-19 vaccines. in the early part of january 2021, brent prices reached their highest levels in 10 months after saudi arabia announced a one-month unilateral cut in its crude oil production for february and march that is in addition to its opec+ commitments. oil prices are back to pre-pandemic levels, driven by global vaccine distribution, an unfolding demand recovery, opec+ agreement on production volume, and a declining production base. however, the surge in covid-19 infections globally and the expected gradual return of spare production capacity make us cautious about near term recovery.
in the united states energy information administration (eia) january 2021 "short term energy outlook," the eia projected brent prices to average $53 per barrel in 2021, while wti prices were projected to average approximately $3.00 less per barrel than brent prices. the international energy agency's (iea) january 2021 "oil market report" forecasts 2021 global demand to average approximately 96.6 million barrels per day, an increase of 6% from 2020.
the recent widespread escalation of covid-19 cases remains a significant factor impacting oil demand. vaccination campaigns are underway; however, several regions, including areas of the united states, are dealing with a rebound in the pandemic resulting in tighter mobility constraints and less travel. there is also concern about whether vaccines will be effective against different strains of the virus that have developed and may develop in the future.
the henry hub natural gas spot price in the united states averaged $2.04 per mmbtu in 2020, a decrease of $0.50 per mmbtu, or 20%, from 2019. the eia expects henry hub natural gas prices to rise to annual average of $3.01 per mmbtu in 2021 and forecasts prices will rise to an average of $3.27 per mmbtu in 2022.
north america operations the average north america rig count decreased 52% for the full year 2020 as compared to 2019. the decline in activity was rapid, but both rig count and completions activity have started to recover off their 2020 lows. we responded swiftly and aggressively to the market conditions, and as business conditions improve, our actions resulted in margin improvements through the second half of 2020. in the first quarter of 2021, we expect positive activity momentum to continue, with completions activity increasing more than drilling. the eia estimates that annual u.s. crude oil production averaged 11.3 million barrels per day as of the year ended 2020, down 1.0 million barrels per day compared to the year ended 2019 as a result of well curtailment and a drop in drilling activity related to low oil prices. the eia expects production to again decline in 2021, averaging 11.1 million barrels per day, and to increase to an annual average of 11.5 million barrels per day in 2022, as prices and drilling conditions become more favorable. we continue to focus on driving strategic changes, building on the operating leverage we have created in the business, and maximizing our cash flow generation in north america.
item 7 | business environment and results of operations the pace of oil consumption growth internationally may, to a significant extent, depend on the manufacture and distribution of effective vaccines on a global scale.
venezuela. the u.s. government imposed sanctions against venezuela have effectively required us to discontinue our operations there. consequently, in connection with us winding down our operations in venezuela, we wrote down all of our remaining investment in venezuela in 2020. as of december 29, 2020 we no longer have any employees in venezuela, although we continue to maintain our local entity, facilities, and equipment in-country, as permitted under applicable law. we are not currently conducting any other operational activities in venezuela.

we reported a consolidated operating loss of $2.4 billion in 2020 driven in part by $3.8 billion of impairments and other charges. this compares to an operating loss of $448 million in 2019, driven by $2.5 billion of impairments and other charges. a significant decline in stimulation activity and pricing in north america land during 2020 negatively impacted operating results, partially offset by increase in stimulation activity and completion tool sales in the middle east/asia. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on impairments and other charges.
operating segments completion and production completion and production revenue was $7.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of $6.2 billion, or 44%, compared to 2019. operating income was $1.0 billion in 2020, a 40% decrease from $1.7 billion in 2019. these results were primarily driven by reduced activity and pricing for pressure pumping services, lower completion tool sales, and reduced artificial lift activity in north america land. partially offsetting these results were higher completion tool sales in the eastern hemisphere.
drilling and evaluation drilling and evaluation revenue was $6.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $1.8 billion, or 21%, from 2019. these results were primarily driven by lower activity for drilling-related services in north america land, lower project management activity in the middle east/asia, and a global decrease in wireline activity.
item 7 | results of operations in 2020 compared to 2019
middle east/asia. partially offsetting these results were improvements in wireline profitability in the middle east/asia and the north sea, as well as drilling-related services in the north sea.
geographic regions north america north america revenue was $5.7 billion in 2020, a 52% decrease compared to 2019, resulting from lower activity and pricing in north america land, primarily associated with reduced stimulation, well construction, artificial lift, and wireline activity. this decline was partially offset by increased stimulation activity in the gulf of mexico and project management in north america land.
latin america latin america revenue was $1.7 billion in 2020, a 29% decrease compared to 2019, resulting primarily from decreased activity in multiple product service lines in argentina, colombia, ecuador, and brazil, partially offset by increased project management activity in mexico and drilling-related services in guyana.
europe/africa/cis europe/africa/cis revenue was $2.8 billion in 2020, a 14% decrease compared to 2019. the decrease was due to lower activity for multiple product service lines throughout the region, primarily in nigeria, egypt, and united kingdom, partially offset by increased completion tool sales in the north sea, algeria, and azerbaijan, and drilling-related activity in the north sea.
middle east/asia middle east/asia revenue was $4.2 billion in 2020, a 13% decrease compared to 2019. the decrease was due to lower activity throughout the region, primarily related to project management, stimulation in saudi arabia, and well construction activity, partially offset by increased completion tool sales and pipeline services in the middle east/asia.
other operating items impairments and other charges were $3.8 billion in 2020, consisting of asset and real estate impairments, primarily associated with pressure pumping and drilling equipment, as well as severance and other costs incurred as we continued to adjust our cost structure during the year. this compares to $2.5 billion of impairments and other charges recorded in 2019, consisting of asset impairments, primarily associated with pressure pumping and drilling equipment, as well as severance and other costs incurred as we adjusted our cost structure during the year. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these charges.
nonoperating items loss on early extinguishment of debt. during the year ended december 31, 2020, we recorded a $168 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt, which included a tender premium, unamortized discounts and costs on the retired notes, and tender fees. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
income tax (provision) benefit. our tax (provisions) benefits are sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings and our ability to use our deferred tax assets. during 2020, we recorded a total income tax benefit of $278 million on a pre-tax loss of $3.2 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 8.6%. during 2019, we recorded a total income tax provision of $7 million on a pre-tax loss of $1.1 billion, resulting in an effective tax rate of -0.6%. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for significant drivers of these tax (provisions) benefits.

item 7 | critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates. our critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our assumptions and judgments about future events and related estimates and how they can impact our financial statements. a critical accounting estimate is one that requires our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and assessments and is fundamental to our results of operations. we identified our most critical accounting estimates to be:
-    forecasting our income tax (provision) benefit, including our future ability to utilize foreign tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax assets (including net operating loss carryforwards), and providing for uncertain tax positions;
-    legal and investigation matters;
-    valuations of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill; and
-    allowance for credit losses.
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable according to the current facts and circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, as well as the significant estimates and judgments affecting the application of these policies. this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.
income tax accounting we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and use an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. we apply the following basic principles in accounting for our income taxes:
-    a current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year;
-    a deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards;
-    the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law, and the effects of potential future changes in tax laws or rates are not considered; and
-    the value of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
we determine deferred taxes separately for each tax-paying component (an entity or a group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. that determination includes the following procedures:
-    measuring the total deferred tax liability for taxable temporary differences using the applicable tax rate;
-    measuring the total deferred tax asset for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards using the applicable tax rate;
-    measuring the deferred tax assets for each type of tax credit carryforward; and
-    reducing the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
our methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment and the use of assumptions and estimates. additionally, we use forecasts of certain tax elements, such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization, as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies. given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables, there can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results that could have a material impact on our income tax accounts related to continuing operations.
item 7 | critical accounting estimates we have operations in more than 70 countries. consequently, we are subject to the jurisdiction of a significant number of taxing authorities. the income earned in these various jurisdictions is taxed on differing bases, including net income actually earned, net income deemed earned, and revenue-based tax withholding. our tax filings are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. the final determination of our income tax liabilities involves the interpretation of local tax laws, tax treaties and related authorities in each jurisdiction, as well as the significant use of estimates and assumptions regarding the scope of future operations and results achieved, the timing and nature of income earned and expenditures incurred. the final determination of tax audits or changes in the operating environment, including changes in tax law and currency/repatriation controls, could impact the determination of our income tax liabilities for a tax year and have an adverse effect on our financial statements.
tax filings of our subsidiaries, unconsolidated affiliates and related entities are routinely examined in the normal course of business by tax authorities. these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, which we work to resolve with the tax authorities and through the judicial process. predicting the outcome of disputed assessments involves some uncertainty. factors such as the availability of settlement procedures, willingness of tax authorities to negotiate, and the operation and impartiality of judicial systems vary across the different tax jurisdictions and may significantly influence the ultimate outcome. we review the facts for each assessment, and then utilize assumptions and estimates to determine the most likely outcome and provide taxes, interest and penalties, as needed based on this outcome. we provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to current accounting standards, which prescribe a minimum recognition threshold and measurement methodology that a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. the standards also provide guidance for derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
legal and investigation matters as discussed in note 10 of our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to various legal and investigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business. as of december 31, 2020, we have accrued an estimate of the probable and estimable costs for the resolution of some of our legal and investigation matters, which is not material to our consolidated financial statements. for other matters for which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable, we have not accrued any amounts. attorneys in our legal department monitor and manage all claims filed against us and review all pending investigations. generally, the estimate of probable costs related to these matters is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing us. our estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. the accuracy of these estimates is impacted by, among other things, the complexity of the issues and the amount of due diligence we have been able to perform. we attempt to resolve these matters through settlements, mediation, and arbitration proceedings when possible. if the actual settlement costs, final judgments or fines, after appeals, differ from our estimates, there may be a material adverse effect on our future financial results. we have in the past recorded significant adjustments to our initial estimates of these types of contingencies.
value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets and goodwill we carry a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and other intangibles. impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, and any impairment charge that we record reduces our operating income. goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. we conduct impairment tests on goodwill annually, during the third quarter, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. we conduct impairment tests on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
when conducting an impairment test on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, we first group individual assets based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets. this requires some judgment. we then compare estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group to its carrying amount. if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying amount, we then determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis. this analysis is based on estimates such as management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, estimates of the remaining useful life and service potential of the assets within the asset group, and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. an impairment loss is measured and recorded as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for impairments and other charges recorded during the year ended december 31, 2020.
item 7 | critical accounting estimates we perform our goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit, which is the same as our reportable segments, the completion and production division and the drilling and evaluation division, comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. we estimate the fair value for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. this analysis includes significant assumptions regarding discount rates, revenue growth rates, expected profitability margins, forecasted capital expenditures and the timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions. if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recorded.
the impairment assessments discussed above incorporate inherent uncertainties, including projected commodity pricing, supply and demand for our services and future market conditions, which are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts. if market conditions further deteriorate, including crude oil prices significantly declining and remaining at low levels for a sustained period of time, we could be required to record additional impairments of the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the future which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies related to long-lived assets.
allowance for credit losses we evaluate our global accounts receivable through a continuous process of assessing our portfolio on an individual customer and overall basis. this process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, financial condition of our customers, and whether the receivables involve retainages. we also consider the economic environment of our customers, both from a marketplace and geographic perspective, in evaluating the need for an allowance. based on our review of these factors, we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. this process involves judgment and estimation, and frequently involves significant dollar amounts. accordingly, our results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance due to actual write-offs that differ from estimated amounts.
at december 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses totaled $824 million, or 22.5% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. at december 31, 2019, our allowance for credit losses totaled $776 million, or 15.4% of notes and accounts receivable before the allowance. the allowance for credit losses in both years is primarily comprised of accounts receivable with our primary customer in venezuela. a hypothetical 100 basis point change in our estimate of the collectability of our notes and accounts receivable balance as of december 31, 2020 would have resulted in a $37 million adjustment to 2020 total operating costs and expenses. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
off balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2020, we had no material off balance sheet arrangements. in the normal course of business, we have agreements with financial institutions under which approximately $1.9 billion of letters of credit, bank guarantees or surety bonds were outstanding as of december 31, 2020. some of the outstanding letters of credit have triggering events that would entitle a bank to require cash collateralization, however, none of these triggering events have occurred.
financial instrument market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we selectively manage these exposures through the use of derivative instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign exchange options, and interest rate swaps. the objective of our risk management strategy is to minimize the volatility from fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates. we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. the counterparties to our forward contracts, options, and interest rate swaps are global commercial and investment banks.
we use a sensitivity analysis model to measure the impact of potential adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. with respect to foreign exchange sensitivity, after consideration of the impact from our foreign forward contracts and options, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the value of all our foreign currency positions relative to the united states dollar as of december 31, 2020 would result in a $83 million, pre-tax, loss for our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than united states dollars. with respect to interest rates sensitivity, after consideration of the impact from our interest rate swap, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the libor rate would result in approximately an additional $1 million of interest charges for the year ended december 31, 2020.
item 7 | financial instrument market risk there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates and interest rates change instantaneously in an equally adverse fashion. in addition, the analysis are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. while this is our best estimate of the impact of the various scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts.

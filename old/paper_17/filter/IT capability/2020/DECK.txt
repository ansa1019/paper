item 1a. risk factors our short and long-term success is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors that are difficult to predict or beyond our control. as a result, investing in our common stock involves substantial risk. before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, stockholders and potential stockholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this annual report, as well as the other information we file with the sec. if any of these risks are realized, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. in that case, the value of our common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment. furthermore, additional risks and uncertainties of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider to be immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
certain statements made in this section constitute "forward-looking statements," which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including those described in this section. refer to the section entitled "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" within this annual report for additional information.
risks related to our business and industry health epidemics, including the pandemic, have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse impact on our business, operations, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, the operations of our customers and business partners, and the markets and communities in which we, our customers, and our partners operate.
the pandemic has had, and other public health crises or epidemics in the future could have, repercussions across local, regional, and global economies and financial markets. the pandemic resulted in a rapid rise in unemployment and a sudden decrease in global economic activity, and many businesses experienced, and may continue to experience, a significant negative impact on their results of operations. during portions of our year ended march 31, 2021, nearly all of our company-operated stores, our partner retail stores, and we believe the retail stores of our wholesale customers were closed to comply with government orders or restrictions, and additional closures may occur in future periods. in response to restrictions resulting from the pandemic, we temporarily furloughed retail store employees and transitioned nearly all of our other employees to a remote work environment. furthermore, in an effort to manage the financial uncertainty involved with the pandemic, we implemented certain cost-saving measures, such as delaying the hiring of certain non-essential employees, which has delayed the completion of certain strategic objectives.
in addition, the demand for our products, as well as our results of operations, could be adversely impacted due to a number of other factors in connection with this or other pandemics, including the following:
•    reduced demand for certain products;
•    decreased store traffic due to retail store closures, social distancing restrictions or changes in consumer behavior;
•    a deterioration in our ability, or the ability of our wholesale customers, to operate in affected regions;
•    reduced availability of our supply of raw materials;
•    the failure of key business partners to provide services for our efficient operations, including the inability of our manufacturers or third-party distributors to timely fulfill their obligations to us;
•    financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers, which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us, or result in order cancellations for our product offerings;
•    seasonality impacts on the demand for certain products, and the ability of our dc and 3pls to timely process orders during periods of heightened demand; and
•    incremental costs resulting from adoption of health and safety preventative measures.
the full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and operations continues to be uncertain and subject to change, and will depend on a number of factors beyond our control. we expect any further spread of the pandemic or the threat or perception that this could occur, or any protracted duration of decreased economic activity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results. further, we have experienced an increase in sales of certain of our products that are desirable to wear within the work-from-home environment, and there can be no assurance that consumers will continue purchasing such products as they transition back into the workplace and restrictions on travel or gatherings are relaxed.
many of our products are inherently seasonal, and the sales of our products are highly sensitive to weather conditions, which makes it difficult to anticipate consumer demand for our products, manage our expenses, and forecast our financial results.
due to the nature of our product offerings, sales of our products are inherently seasonal. historically, the highest percentage of ugg brand net sales have occurred during the fall and winter (our second and third fiscal quarters), and the highest percentage of teva and sanuk brand net sales have occurred during the spring and summer (our first and fourth fiscal quarters). due to the magnitude of the ugg brand relative to our other brands, seasonal trends have resulted in our net sales for the second and third fiscal quarters significantly exceeding that of the first and fourth fiscal quarters. although our ongoing strategic efforts to diversify our offerings by creating additional year-round styles and expanding product offerings within our existing brands has had a meaningful positive impact on our seasonality trends, we expect our quarterly net sales to continue fluctuating for the foreseeable future. in particular, sales of our products are highly sensitive to weather conditions, which are difficult to predict and beyond our control. for example, extended periods of unseasonably warm weather during the fall or winter may significantly reduce demand for our ugg brand products. unfavorable or unexpected weather patterns may have a material, negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and the effects of climate change may pronounce these conditions. in addition, the unpredictability of weather conditions makes it more difficult for us to accurately forecast our financial results and meet the expectations of analysts and investors.
due to the relative concentration of our sales in certain months of the year, factors impacting consumer spending patterns in those months, such as unexpected weather patterns, declines in consumer confidence, changing consumer preferences, or uncertain economic conditions, will disproportionately impact our business and could result in our failure to achieve financial performance that is in line with our expectations or the expectations of market participants. in addition, significant fluctuations in our financial performance from period to period due to these or other factors could increase the volatility of our stock price, which could cause our stock price to decline.
the footwear, apparel, and accessories industry is subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences, and if we do not accurately anticipate and promptly respond to consumer demand and spending patterns, we could lose sales, our relationships with customers could be harmed, and our brand loyalty could be diminished.
the footwear, apparel, and accessories industry is subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and tastes, which make it difficult to anticipate demand for our products and forecast our financial results. we believe there are many factors that may affect the demand for our products, including:
•    seasonality, including the impact of anticipated and unanticipated weather conditions;
•    consumer acceptance of our existing and new products, and our ability to develop new products that address the needs and preferences of consumers;
•    consumer perceptions of and preferences for our products and brands, including as a result of evolving ethical, political or social standards;
•    consumer demand for our competitors' products;
•    whether consumers view certain of our products as substitutes for other products we manufacture;
•    publicity, including social media, related to us, our products, our brands, our marketing campaigns and our celebrity endorsers;
•    the life cycle of our products and consumer replenishment behavior;
•    legislation restricting our ability to use certain materials in our products; and
•    changes in general economic, political, and market conditions.
our success is driven to some extent by brand loyalty, and there can be no assurance that consumers will continue to prefer our brands. consumer demand for our products depends in part on the continued strength of our brands, which in turn depends on our ability to anticipate, understand and promptly respond to the rapidly changing preferences and fashion tastes for footwear, apparel, and accessories, as well as consumer spending patterns. as our brands and product offerings continue to evolve, it is necessary for our products to appeal to an even broader range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty. many of our products, particularly our ugg brand product offerings, include a fashion element and could go out of style at any time. further, the value of our brands is largely based on evolving consumer perceptions, and concerns with respect to factors such as product quality, product design, technical performance, product components or materials, including the sustainability of products or materials, or customer service, could result in negative perceptions and a corresponding loss of brand loyalty and value. in addition, negative claims or publicity regarding us, our products, our brands, our marketing campaigns, our partners or our celebrity endorsers, could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of containing any such negative claims. if consumers begin to have negative perceptions of our brands, whether or not warranted, our brand image would become tarnished and our products would become less desirable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
changes in economic conditions may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
volatile economic conditions and general changes in the market have affected, and will likely continue to affect, consumer spending generally and the buying habits and preferences of consumers. a significant portion of the products we sell, especially those sold under the ugg brand, are luxury retail products. the purchase of these products by consumers is largely discretionary and is therefore highly dependent upon the level of consumer confidence and discretionary spending, particularly among affluent consumers. sales of these products may be adversely affected by factors such as worsening economic conditions, consumer confidence in future economic conditions, increases in consumer debt levels, and increases in unemployment rates. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, particularly in light of the impacts of the pandemic, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. during an actual or perceived economic downturn, fewer consumers may shop for our products, and those who do shop may limit the amount of their purchases or substitute less costly products for our products. as a result, we could be required to reduce the price we can charge for our products or increase our marketing and promotional expenses to generate additional demand for our products. in either case, these changes could reduce our sales and profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
we sell a large portion of our products through higher-end specialty and department store retailers. the businesses of these retailer customers may be impacted by factors such as changes in economic conditions, reduced consumer demand for luxury products, decreases in available credit, and increased competition. if these or other factors result in financial difficulties or insolvency for our retail customers, such pressures would have an adverse impact on our estimated allowances and reserves, and potentially result in us losing key customers.
we face intense competition from both established companies and newer entrants into the market, and our failure to compete effectively could cause our market share to decline, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
the footwear, apparel, and accessories industry is highly competitive and subject to changing consumer preferences and tastes. we believe we compete on the basis of a number of factors, including our ability to:
•    predict and respond to changing consumer preferences and tastes in a timely manner;
•    produce products that meet our requirements and consumer expectations for quality and technical performance;
•    accurately predict and forecast consumer demand;
•    ensure product availability;
•    manage the impact of seasonality, including unexpected changes in weather conditions;
•    price our products in a competitive manner;
•    ensure availability of raw materials and production capacity;
•    implement our omni-channel strategy, including providing a unique customer service experience;
•    manage the impact of the rapidly changing retail environment, including with respect to rising competition within the e-commerce business, especially from online retailers such as amazon.com.
our inability to compete effectively with respect to one or more of these factors could cause our market share to decline, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, the disruptions caused by the pandemic may ultimately require us to reduce our opportunities in certain markets, which could negatively impact our prospects for long-term growth.
our competitors include both established companies, as well as newer entrants into the market. in particular, we believe that, as a result of the growth of the ugg brand, certain competitors have entered the marketplace specifically in response to the success of our brands, and that other competitors may do so in the future. a number of our larger competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution resources than we do, as well as greater brand awareness in the footwear, apparel, and accessories markets among consumers. further, these competitors may have relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. our competitors' greater resources and capabilities in these areas may enable them to more effectively compete on the basis of price and production, develop new products more quickly or with superior technical capabilities, market their products and brands more successfully, identify or influence consumer preferences, increase their market share, withstand the impacts of seasonality, and manage periodic downturns in the footwear, apparel, and accessories industry or in economic conditions generally. with respect to newer entrants into the market, we believe that factors such as access to offshore manufacturing and changes in technology will make it easier and more cost effective for these companies to compete with us.
as a result of the competitive environment in which we operate, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, intense pricing pressure. efforts by our competitors to dispose of their excess inventories may significantly reduce prices of competitive products, which may put pressure on us to reduce the pricing of our products to compete, or cause consumers to shift their purchasing decisions away from our products entirely. we have also faced, and expect to continue to face, intense pressure with respect to competition for key customer accounts and distribution channels. further, we believe that our key customers face intense competition from their competitors, which could negatively impact the financial stability of their businesses and their ability to conduct business with us.
if we fail to compete effectively in the future, our sales could decline, and our margins could be impacted, either of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
we use sheepskin to manufacture a significant portion of our products, and if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of sheepskin at acceptable prices that meets our quality expectations, or if there are legal or social impediments to our ability to use sheepskin, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.
for the manufacturing of our products, we purchase certain raw materials that are affected by commodity prices, the most significant of which is sheepskin. the supply of sheepskin, which is used to manufacture a significant portion of our ugg brand products, is in high demand and there are a limited number of suppliers that are able to meet our expectations for the quantity and quality of sheepskin that we require. in addition, our unique product design and animal welfare standards require sheepskin that may be found only in certain geographies. we presently rely on only two tanneries to provide the majority of our sheepskin. if the sheepskin provided by these tanneries and the resulting products we produce do not conform to our quality or sustainability specifications or fail to meet consumer expectations, we could experience reduced demand for our products, a higher rate of customer returns and negative impacts on the image of our brands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. similarly, if these tanneries are not able to deliver sheepskin in the quantities required, or were to cease operations, we may not be able to obtain suitable substitute materials in time to avoid interruption of our production schedules, which would limit our ability to meet demand for our products, lead to inventory shortages, result in a loss of sales, strain our customer relationships, and harm our reputation. in addition, any factors that negatively impact the business of these tanneries, or the businesses of the suppliers that warehouse their inventories, such as loss of customers, financial instability, loss or destruction of property, work stoppages, political instability, or acts of terrorism or catastrophic events, could result in shortages in our supply of sheepskin.
while we have experienced fairly stable pricing in recent years, historically there have been significant fluctuations in the price of sheepskin as the demand for this commodity from our consumers and our competitors has changed. we believe the significant factors affecting the price of sheepskin include weather patterns, harvesting decisions, incidence of disease, the price of other commodities, such as wool and leather, the demand for our products and the products of our competitors, and global economic conditions. any factors that increase the demand for, or decrease the supply of, sheepskin could cause significant increases in the price of sheepskin, which would increase our manufacturing costs and reduce our gross margins. in addition, we use purchasing contracts and other pricing arrangements to attempt to reduce the potential impact of fluctuations in sheepskin prices on our results of operations. however, in the event of a prolonged increase in sheepskin prices such as what we have experienced in the past, these strategies may not be sufficient to offset the negative impact on our results of operations. in that event, it is unlikely we would be able to adjust our product prices sufficiently to eliminate the impact on our gross margins and our financial results may suffer. in an effort to reduce our dependency on sheepskin, we are seeking sustainable alternatives for key product materials.
further, our industry is characterized by rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. we believe there is a growing trend within the fashion industry towards eliminating the use of certain animal products, most notably fur. for example, legislation has been passed in the us banning the sale of fur in certain cities, and similar legislation is being considered in other geographies. while the use of leather goods and sheepskin has typically not been subject to this type of legislation, it is possible that future legislation could restrict our ability to use sheepskin in the products we sell in certain geographies. in addition, notwithstanding whether specific legislation is passed, it is possible that consumer preferences may change based on evolving ethical or social standards, such that our products may potentially become less desirable to certain consumers. because sheepskin is currently used to manufacture a significant portion of our ugg brand products, any legal or social impediments to the sale of products that include sheepskin, especially within our large target markets, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
if we are unsuccessful at improving our operational systems and our efforts do not result in the anticipated benefits to us or result in unanticipated disruption to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and our business may become less competitive.
we continually strive to improve, automate and streamline our operational systems, processes and infrastructure as part of our ongoing effort to improve the overall efficiency and competitiveness of our business. while these efforts have resulted in some improvements to our operational systems, we expect to continue to incur expenses to implement additional improvements and upgrades to our systems. many of these expenditures have been, and may continue to be, incurred in advance of the realization of any direct benefits to our business. we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at improving our operational systems, or that our efforts will result in the anticipated benefits to us. if our operational system upgrades and improvements are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, and our business may become less competitive.
further, our future success and growth depend in part on the continued operation of our key business processes, including our information technology and global communications systems. our operational system upgrades have the potential to be disruptive to our existing business operations as our managers and employees attempt to learn new software programs and control systems while continuing to manage and operate our business. in addition, as our business grows and we expand our brands and products into additional distribution channels and geographic regions, these systems may require expansion. if we are unable to modify our systems to respond to changes in our business needs, or if we experience a failure or interruption in these systems, our ability to accurately forecast sales, report our financial position and results of operations, or otherwise manage and operate our business could be adversely affected.
if we are unsuccessful at managing product manufacturing decisions, we may be unable to accurately forecast our inventory and working capital requirements, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
like other companies in the footwear, apparel and accessories industry, we have an extended design and manufacturing process, which involves the initial design of our products, the purchase of raw materials, the accumulation of inventories, the subsequent sale of the inventories, and the collection of the resulting accounts receivable. this production cycle requires us to incur significant expenses relating to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products, including product development costs for new products, in advance of the realization of any revenue from the sale of our products, and results in significant liquidity requirements and working capital fluctuations throughout our fiscal year. because the production cycle typically involves long lead times, which require us to make manufacturing decisions several months in advance of an anticipated purchasing decision by the consumer, it is challenging for us to estimate and manage our inventory and working capital requirements. once manufacturing decisions are made, it is difficult for our management to predict and timely adjust expenses in reaction to various factors, including the following:
•    unfavorable weather patterns and related impacts on consumer spending and demand for our products;
•    changes in consumer preferences, tastes, discretionary spending, and prevailing fashion trends;
•    market acceptance of our current products and new products, and of competitive products;
•    future sales demand from our wholesale customers;
•    the competitive environment, including pricing pressure resulting from reduced pricing of competitive products, which may cause consumers to shift their purchasing decisions away from our products;
•    delays in resource or product availability due to impacts from widespread illness or disease; and
•    uncertain macroeconomic and political conditions.
the evolution and expansion of our brands and product offerings has made our inventory management activities more challenging. for example, if we overestimate demand for any products or styles, we may be forced to incur significant markdowns or sell excess inventories at reduced prices, which would result in lower revenues and reduced gross margins. on the other hand, if we underestimate demand, or if our independent manufacturing facilities are unable to supply products in sufficient quantities, we may experience inventory shortages that may prevent us from fulfilling customer orders or result in us delaying shipments to customers. if that occurred, we could lose sales, our relationships with customers could be harmed, and our brand loyalty could be diminished. in either event, these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
it may be difficult to identify new retail store locations that meet our requirements, and any new retail stores may not realize returns on our investments.
while we expect to identify additional retail stores for closure as part of our ongoing optimization efforts, we may simultaneously identify opportunities to open new retail stores in the future. global store openings involve substantial investments, including those relating to leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, equipment, information systems, inventory, and personnel. since a certain amount of our retail store costs are fixed, if we have insufficient sales at a new store location, we may be unable to reduce expenses to avoid losses or negative cash flows. due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the retail business, the closure of a retail store can result in a significant negative financial impact, including lost sales, write-offs of retail store assets and inventory, lease termination costs, and severance costs. in light of the significant costs and impairments that can be incurred upon the closure of a retail location, we expect to conduct a thorough diligence process and apply stringent financial parameters when assessing whether to open a new retail store location. however, there can be no assurance that any new retail location will generate a positive return on our investment or increase our sales. we will continue to evaluate our retail store fleet strategy in response to changes in consumer demand and retail store traffic patterns.
furthermore, we license the right to operate retail stores for our brands to third parties through our partner retail program. we currently plan for most of the partner retail stores to be operated in international markets, with the largest number anticipated to be in china. we provide training to support these stores and set and monitor operational standards. however, the quality of these store operations may decline due to the failure of these third parties to operate the stores in a manner consistent with our standards or our failure to adequately monitor these third parties, which could result in reduced sales and cause our brand image to suffer. we will continue to evaluate our partner retail strategy and our retail approach in international markets in response to changes in consumer demand, retail store traffic patterns, and our brand and regional strategies.
our financial success is influenced by the success of our customers, and the loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
much of our financial success is directly related to the ability of our retailer and distributor partners to successfully market and sell our brands directly to consumers. if a partner fails to satisfy contractual obligations or to otherwise meet our expectations, or experiences complete or partial closure or other operational issues resulting from government restrictions, reduced consumer demand or other factors, it may be difficult to locate an acceptable substitute partner. if we determine that it is necessary to make a change, we may experience increased costs, loss of customers, or increased credit or inventory risk. in addition, there is no guarantee that any replacement partner will generate results that are more favorable than the terminated party.
we currently do not have long-term contracts with any of our retailers. we do have contracts with our distributors with terms ranging up to five years, however, while these contracts may have annual purchase minimums which must be met in order to retain the distribution rights, the distributors are not otherwise obligated to purchase our products. sales to our retailers and distributors are generally on an order-by-order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by our wholesale customers. we use the timing of delivery dates for our wholesale customer orders as a key factor in forecasting our sales and earnings for future periods. if any of our major customers experience a significant downturn in business or fail to remain committed to our products or brands, these customers could postpone, reduce, or discontinue purchases from us, which could result in us failing to meet our forecasted results. these risks have been exacerbated recently as our key retail customers are operating within a retail industry that continues to undergo significant structural changes fueled by technology and the internet, changes in consumer purchasing behavior, and a shrinking retail footprint. these trends have been further impacted by the pandemic. we may lose key retail and wholesale customers if they fail to manage the impact of the rapidly changing retail environment. any loss of one of these key customers, or a significant reduction in purchases from one of these customers could result in a significant decline in sales, write-downs of excess inventory, or increased discounts to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. further, a key customer may dispose of their excess inventories to consumers or unauthorized sellers at significantly reduced prices, which may put pressure on us to reduce our prices to compete, or cause consumers to shift their purchasing decisions away from our authorized sellers entirely.
we depend on qualified personnel and, if we are unable to retain or hire executive officers, key employees and skilled personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our results of operations may suffer.
to execute our growth plan, we must continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, including executive officers and key employees. further, to continue to develop new products and successfully operate and grow our key business processes, it is important for us to continue hiring highly skilled footwear, apparel and accessories designers and information technology specialists. competition for executive officers, key employees and skilled personnel is intense within our industry and there continues to be upward pressure on the compensation paid to these professionals. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater name recognition and financial resources than we have. if we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that we or these employees have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. in addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the stock-based compensation they receive in connection with their employment when deciding whether to take a job. if the perceived value of our stock-based compensation declines, or if the price of our stock experiences significant volatility, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain and motivate qualified personnel.
further, our domestic headquarters are located in goleta, california, which is not generally recognized as a prominent commercial center, and it is difficult to attract qualified professionals due to our location. our european headquarters are located in the uk, and there remains significant uncertainty regarding the impact of brexit on the legal and commercial relationships between the uk and the eu, which could make it difficult for us to attract and retain key employees in the uk. if we are unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to execute our growth plan, we may be unable to achieve our strategic objectives, our results of operations may suffer, and we may be unable to compete in the market.
the continued service of our executive officers and key employees is particularly important, and the hiring or departure of such personnel may disrupt our business or result in the depletion of significant institutional knowledge. our executive officers and key employees are generally employed on an at-will basis, which means that they can terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees or significant turnover in our senior management, and the often-extensive process of identifying and hiring other personnel to fill those key positions, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we rely upon a number of warehouse and distribution facilities to operate our business, and any damage to one of these facilities, or any disruptions caused by incorporating new facilities into our operations, could have a material adverse impact on our business.
we rely upon a broad network of warehouse and distribution facilities to store, sort, package and distribute our products. in the us, we distribute products primarily through a self-managed dc in moreno valley, california. during fiscal year 2020, we transitioned all of our camarillo, california distribution operations to moreno valley, which features a complex warehouse management system that enables us to efficiently pack products for direct shipment to customers. further, during our fourth fiscal quarter ended march 31, 2021, we entered into a lease for a dc located in mooresville, indiana, to expand our distribution facilities. we could face a significant disruption in our domestic dc operations if our warehouse management system does not perform as anticipated or ceases to function for an extended period of time, which could occur due to damage to the facility, failure of software or equipment, cyber-security incidents, power outages or similar problems, or due to mandatory or elective closure in response to government orders addressing the pandemic. in addition, if our domestic dc operations and scaling efforts are impeded or delayed for any reason, it could result in shipment delays or the inability to deliver product at all, which would result in lost sales, strain our relationships with customers, and cause harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
internationally, we distribute our products through distribution centers managed by 3pls in canada, china, japan, the netherlands, and the uk. we also distribute our products through a domestic 3pl located in pennsylvania. we depend on these 3pls to manage the operation of their distribution centers as necessary to meet our business needs. if our 3pls fail to manage these responsibilities, our distribution operations could face significant disruptions. the loss of or disruption to the operations of any one or more of these facilities could materially adversely impact our sales, business performance, and results of operations. although we believe we possess adequate insurance to cover the potential impact of a disruption to the operations of these facilities, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
we rely upon independent manufacturers for most of our production needs, and the failure of these manufacturers to manage these responsibilities would prevent us filling customer orders, which would result in loss of sales and harm our relationships with customers.
we rely on independent manufacturers and their respective material suppliers for most of our production needs, and we do not have direct control over the manufacturers or their suppliers. we depend on these independent manufacturers for a number of functions that are critical to our operations, including financing the production of goods ordered, maintaining manufacturing capacity, complying with our policies, including our supplier code of conduct and restricted substances policy, and storing finished goods in a safe location pending shipment. if the independent manufacturers fail to manage these responsibilities, or if they were to experience significant disruption to their business, we may be unable to ensure timely delivery of products, products may not be delivered in sufficient quantities, and products may fail to meet our quality standards. if any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to fill customer orders or product may be inadvertently delivered that does not meet our quality standards, which would result in lost sales and harm to our relationships with customers.
we do not currently have long-term contracts with these independent manufacturers, and so are not assured of a long-term, uninterrupted supply of products from them. while we do have long-standing relationships with most of these independent manufacturers, any of them may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time, seek to increase the prices they charge, or extract other concessions from us. in the event of a termination of an existing relationship with a manufacturer, we may not be able to substitute alternative manufacturers that are capable of providing products of a comparable quality, in a sufficient quantity, at an acceptable price, or on a timely basis. if we are required to find alternative manufacturers, we could experience a delay in the manufacturing of our products, increased manufacturing costs, as well as substantial disruption to our business, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations.
interruptions in the supply of our products can also result from adverse events that impair the operations of our manufacturers. for example, we keep proprietary materials that are required for the production of our products, such as shoe molds and raw materials, under the custody of our independent manufacturers. if these independent manufacturers were to experience loss or damage to these proprietary materials, we cannot be assured that the manufacturers would have adequate insurance to cover such loss or damage, and, in any event, the replacement of such materials would likely result in significant delays in the production of our products, which could result in a loss of sales and earnings.
increasing scrutiny from investors and other key stakeholders with respect to our esg practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.
investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, stockholders, and customers are increasingly focused on corporate responsibility, specifically on the esg practices of companies. these parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. from time to time we communicate certain esg initiatives and goals to market participants and our customers and business partners. any corporate responsibility disclosure we make may include our policies, practices, initiatives and goals on a variety of social and ethical matters, corporate governance, environmental compliance, sustainability, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, product quality, supply chain management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. although we have undertaken expansive efforts to improve and implement our esg initiatives, it is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our esg practices or the speed of their adoption. if our esg practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, or if we are perceived to have not appropriately responded to the growing concern for esg issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, we may suffer from reputational damage and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. further, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, to achieve our esg initiatives or goals, or we could fail to fully and accurately report our progress on such initiatives and goals, which could negatively impact our business.
our corporate culture has contributed to our success and, if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the passion, creativity, teamwork, focus and innovation fostered by our culture.
we believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. if we do not maintain our culture and core values over time, we may be unable to foster the passion, creativity, teamwork, focus, and innovation that we believe have contributed to the growth and success of our business. any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel and to effectively focus on and pursue our strategic objectives. as we continue to pursue our goals and implement new strategies, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture, which may be exacerbated by restrictions adopted in response to the pandemic, which may make it difficult for employees to interact, communicate and innovate.
labor disruptions could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position.
our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. labor disputes, shortages, and stoppages that affect the operations of our independent manufacturers, tanneries, transportation carriers, retail stores, or distribution centers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, strikes, or similar disruptions. for example, labor disputes at us shipping ports have impacted the delivery of our products. in addition, there is the potential for labor disruptions in the uk as a result of ongoing uncertainty around the future trade relationship between the eu and uk. furthermore, we have experienced challenges attracting and retaining employees to staff our dc operations as we increasingly compete with companies with e-commerce businesses. any such challenges or disruptions may potentially result in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation, and increased transportation and labor costs, each of which may negatively impact our results of operations and financial position.
we face risks associated with pursuing strategic acquisitions, and our failure to successfully integrate any acquired business or product could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
as part of our overall strategy, we may periodically consider strategic acquisitions to expand our brands into complementary product categories and markets, or to acquire new brands, technologies, intellectual property, or other assets. our ability to do so depends on our ability to identify and successfully pursue suitable acquisition opportunities. such acquisitions involve numerous risks, challenges and uncertainties, including the potential to:
•    expose us to risks inherent in entering into a new market or geographic region;
•    lose significant customers or key personnel of the acquired business;
•    encounter difficulties managing and implementing acquired assets;
•    encounter difficulties marketing to new consumers or managing geographically remote operations;
•    divert management's time and attention away from other aspects of our business operations; and
•    incur costs relating to a potential acquisition that we fail to consummate, which we may not recover.
additionally, we may not be able to successfully integrate the assets or operations of any acquired businesses into our operations, or to achieve the expected benefits of any acquisitions. following an acquisition, we may also face cannibalization of existing product sales by our newly acquired products, unless we adequately integrate new products with our existing products, aggressively target different consumers for our newly acquired products and increase our overall market share. the failure to successfully integrate any acquired business or products in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
further, we may be required to issue equity securities to finance an acquisition, which would be dilutive to our stockholders, and the equity securities may have rights or preferences senior to those of our existing stockholders. if we incur indebtedness to finance an acquisition, it would result in debt service costs, and we may be subject to covenants restricting our operations or liens encumbering our assets.
risks related to our global business strategy and international commerce we may not succeed in implementing our growth strategies, in which case we may not be able to take advantage of certain market opportunities and may become less competitive.
as part of our overall growth strategy, we are continually seeking out opportunities to enhance the positioning of our brands, diversify our product offerings, extend our brands into complementary product categories and markets, expand geographically, optimize our retail presence both in stores and online, and improve our financial performance and operational efficiency. in addition, as part of our international growth strategy, we may continue to transition from a third-party distribution model to a direct distribution model for certain brands. conversely, we may shift from a direct distribution model to a third-party distribution model for certain other brands. further, we are exploring relationships with third parties for the expansion of the ugg brand into different product categories, including licensee and sourcing agent arrangements. such efforts may be mitigated or suspended as we navigate the impacts of the pandemic and implement prudent cost-saving measures. we anticipate that substantial further expansion will be required to realize our growth potential and take advantage of new market opportunities. failure to effectively implement our growth strategy could negatively impact our revenues and rate of growth and result in our business becoming less competitive. in addition, taking steps to implement our growth initiatives could have a number of negative effects, including increasing our working capital needs, causing us to incur costs without any corresponding benefits, and diverting management time and resources away from our existing business.
most of our independent manufacturers are located outside of the us, where we are subject to the risks associated with international commerce.
most of our independent manufacturers are located in asia. foreign manufacturing is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the following:
•    tariffs, import and export controls, and other non-tariff barriers;
•    increasing transportation costs, delays during shipping at the port of entry or port of departure, and a limited supply of international shipping capacity;
•    increasing labor costs and labor disruptions;
•    poor infrastructure and shortages of equipment, which can disrupt transportation and utilities;
•    restrictions on the transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions;
•    changing economic and market conditions;
•    changes in governmental regulations, including with respect to intellectual property, labor, safety, and the environment;
•    refusal to adopt or comply with our manufacturing policies;
•    customary business traditions in certain countries such as local holidays, which are traditionally accompanied by high levels of turnover in the factories;
•    decreased scrutiny by custom officials for counterfeit products;
•    practices involving corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft, and other fraudulent activity;
•    social unrest and political instability, including acts of war and other external factors;
•    use of unauthorized or prohibited materials or reclassification of materials;
•    health-related concerns that could result in a reduced workforce or scarcity of raw materials;
•    adverse changes in consumer perception of goods sourced from certain countries.
these risks and uncertainties, or others of which we are currently unaware, could interfere with the manufacture or shipment of our products by our independent manufacturers. this could make it more difficult to obtain adequate supplies of quality products, which could negatively impact our sales and earnings.
while we require our independent manufacturers and their suppliers to adhere to environmental, labor, ethical, health, safety, and other standard business practices and applicable local laws, and while we periodically visit and audit their operations, we do not control their business practices. if we discover non-compliant manufacturers or suppliers that cannot or will not become compliant, we would cease conducting business with them, which could increase our costs and interrupt our product supply chain. our manufacturers' violations of applicable laws and business standards could also result in negative publicity, which could damage our reputation and the value of our brands. further, if our manufacturers or suppliers violate us or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to extra duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of products we are attempting to import, or the loss of our import privileges, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
our sales in international markets are subject to a variety of legal, regulatory, political, cultural and economic risks that may adversely impact our results of operations in certain regions.
our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operation in our existing international markets is subject to risks associated with international operations that could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. these risks include:
•    foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations, which impact the prices at which products are sold to international consumers;
•    limitations on our ability to move currency out of international markets;
•    burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, which may change unexpectedly, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;
•    legal costs related to defending allegations of non-compliance with foreign laws;
•    inability to import products into a foreign country;
•    difficulties associated with promoting and marketing products in unfamiliar cultures;
•    political or economic uncertainty or instability;
•    changes in unemployment rates and consumer spending;
•    anti-american sentiment in international markets in which we operate;
•    changes in diplomatic and trade relationships between the us and other countries; and
•    general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.
we conduct business outside the us, which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk, and could have a negative impact on our financial results.
we operate on a global basis, with 30.8% of our net sales for the year ended march 31, 2021 from operations outside the us. as we continue to increase our international operations, our sales and expenditures in foreign currencies are expected to become more material and subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. a significant portion of our international operating expenses are paid in local currencies and our foreign distributors typically sell our products in local currency, which impacts the price to foreign consumers. many of our subsidiaries operate with their local currency as their functional currency. future foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and global credit markets may cause changes in the us dollar value of our purchases or sales and materially affect our sales, profit margins, and results of operations, when converted to us dollars. changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in material foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and, as a result, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected.we routinely utilize foreign currency exchange rate forward contracts or other derivative instruments for the amounts we expect to purchase and sell in foreign currencies to mitigate exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. as we continue to expand international operations and increase purchases and sales in foreign currencies, we may utilize additional derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. our hedging strategies depend on our forecasts of sales, expenses, and cash flows, which are inherently subject to inaccuracies. foreign currency exchange rate hedges, transactions, remeasurements, or translations could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
international trade and import regulations may impose unexpected duty costs, the revision of current trade agreements may require us to alter current practices, changes in trade relations may result in tariffs, and transportation challenges and security procedures may cause significant delays and additional costs. products manufactured overseas and imported into the us and other countries are subject to import duties. while we have implemented internal measures to comply with applicable customs regulations and to properly calculate the import duties applicable to imported products, customs authorities may disagree with our claimed tariff treatment for certain products, resulting in unexpected costs that may not have been factored into the sales price of such products and our forecasted gross margins. in addition, we cannot predict whether future domestic and foreign laws, regulations, or specific or broad trade remedy actions, or international agreements may impose additional duties or other restrictions on the importation of products from one or more of our sourcing venues.
international trade policy is undergoing review and revision, introducing significant uncertainty with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements. changes in tax policy or trade regulations could cause us to encounter new customs duties, which in turn may require us to implement new supply chains, withdraw from certain markets or change our business methods, which could make it difficult to obtain products of our customary quality at a competitive price and could lead to an increase in the cost of our products. the continued negotiation of free trade agreements with countries other than our principal sourcing venues may stimulate competition for manufacturers. manufacturers in these locations may seek to export footwear, apparel, and accessories to our target markets at preferred rates of duty which may negatively impact our sales and operations.
trade relations between our sourcing venues, particularly those in china, and the us have created uncertainty for all us businesses that source or market in china. in january 2020, the us and china reached a trade deal which, among other things, limits import duties and tariffs. although the trade deal currently remains in effect, there is no guarantee that the agreement will be honored by either party. further, the potential for additional import duties or other restrictions on imports from china remains, which could increase the cost of sourcing in china, our own margins, and possibly the price of our products to consumers. we have transitioned most of our footwear sourcing from china to vietnam as part of our supplier optimization strategy. if we are unable to source our products from the countries where we wish to purchase them, or if the cost of doing so increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
transportation and distribution costs may be adversely impacted by new regulations, increased demand, increased fuel and labor costs, and political and economic instability. due to the pandemic, reductions in the number of ocean carrier voyages and capacity may delay the arrival of imports. after the pandemic, we anticipate cost increases in ocean transports globally. ongoing ocean carrier consolidation, reduced capacity, congestion at major international gateways and other economic factors are challenging ocean transportation. further, in the us, trucking costs have risen dramatically due to driver shortages, increased labor costs, and safety, environmental, and labor regulations. these changes, as well as pandemic-related restrictions on trucking and our dc operations, may disrupt our supply chain and delay the shipment of our products, causing us to incur significant additional costs. additionally, the increased threat of terrorist activity, and law enforcement responses to this threat, have required greater levels of inspection of imported goods and caused delays in bringing imported goods to market. any tightening of security procedures could worsen these delays and increase our costs.
risks related to our legal, compliance, and regulatory environment failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to prevent counterfeiting of our products, or to defend claims against us related to our intellectual property rights, could reduce sales and adversely affect the value of our brands.
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our intellectual property rights. we believe our competitive position is largely attributable to the value of our trademarks, patents, trade dress, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights. an unfortunate reaction to the success of our brands is that we have become a target of counterfeiting and product imitation strategies. although we are aggressive in legal and other actions in pursuing those who infringe on our intellectual property rights, we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken will be adequate to protect our brands in the future, especially because some countries' laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws. if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, it would allow our competitors to sell products that are similar to and directly competitive with our products, or we could otherwise lose opportunities to sell our products to consumers who may instead purchase a counterfeit or imitation product, which could reduce sales of our products and adversely affect the value of our brands. in addition, any intellectual property lawsuits in which we are involved could cost a significant amount of time and money and distract management's attention from operating our business, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. in addition to fighting intellectual property infringement, we may need to defend claims against us related to our intellectual property rights. for example, we have faced claims that the word "ugg" is a generic term. such a claim was successful in australia, but similar claims have been rejected by courts in the us, china, turkey, and the netherlands. any court decision or settlement that invalidates or limits trademark protection of our brands, that allows a third-party to continue to sell products similar to our products, or that allows a manufacturer or distributor to continue to sell counterfeit products, could lead to intensified competition and a material reduction in our sales, and could have a material adverse effect on the value of our brands.
a security breach or other disruption to our information technology systems could result in the loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access of customer, supplier, or sensitive company information or could disrupt our operations, which could damage our relationships with customers, suppliers or employees, expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings, or harm our reputation, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
our business involves the storage and transmission of a significant amount of personal, confidential, or sensitive information, including the personal information of our customers and employees, credit card information, and our proprietary financial, operational, and strategic information. the protection of this information is vitally important to us as the loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access of such information could lead to significant reputation or competitive harm, result in litigation involving us or our business partners, expose us to regulatory proceedings, and cause us to incur substantial losses. as a result, we believe our future success and growth depends, in part, on the ability of our key business processes and systems, including our information technology and global communication systems, to prevent the theft, loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access of this personal, confidential, and sensitive information, and to respond quickly and effectively if data security incidents do occur. we are subject to numerous data privacy and security risks, which may prevent us from maintaining the privacy of this information, result in the disruption of our business, and require us to expend significant resources attempting to secure and protect such information and respond to incidents, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
the frequency, intensity, and sophistication of cyber-attacks, ransom-ware attacks, and other data security incidents have significantly increased in recent years. like other businesses, we have experienced, and are continually at risk of, attacks and incidents. due to the increased risk of such attacks and incidents, we expend significant resources on information technology and data security tools, measures, and processes designed to protect our information technology systems, as well as the personal, confidential, or sensitive information stored on or transmitted through those systems, and to ensure an effective response to any attack or incident. whether these measures are ultimately successful, these expenditures could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and divert management's attention from pursuing our strategic objectives.
although we take the security of our information technology systems seriously, there can be no assurance that the measures we employ will prevent unauthorized persons from obtaining access to our systems and information. despite our implementation of reasonable security measures, our systems and information may be susceptible to cyber-attacks or data security incidents. these risks may be exacerbated in a remote work environment. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems are constantly evolving, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate protective measures in response. cyber-attacks or data incidents could remain undetected for some period, which could result in significant harm to our systems, as well as unauthorized access to the information stored on and transmitted by our systems. further, despite our security efforts and training, our employees may purposefully or inadvertently cause security breaches. a cyber-attack or other data security incident could result in significant disruption of our business such that:
•    critical business systems become inoperable or require significant time or cost to restore;
•    key personnel are unable to perform their duties or communicate with employees or third-party partners;
•    it results in the loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information;
•    we are prevented from accessing information necessary to conduct our business;
•    we are required to make unanticipated investments in equipment, technology or security measures;
•    customers cannot place or receive orders, and we are unable to timely ship orders or at all; or
•    we become subject to other unanticipated liabilities, costs, or claims.
if any of these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and result in harm to our reputation. in addition, if a cyber-attack or other data incident results in the loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access of personal, confidential, or sensitive information belonging to our customers, suppliers, or employees, it could put us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the deterioration of our customers' confidence in our brands, cause our suppliers to reconsider their relationship with our company or impose more onerous contractual provisions, and subject us to potential litigation, liability, fines, and penalties. for example, we could be subject to regulatory or other actions pursuant to domestic and international privacy laws, which could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties, operational changes, and negative publicity that could adversely affect our reputation, as well as our results of operations and financial condition.
if we are found to have violated laws concerning the privacy and security of consumers' or other individuals' personal information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.
there are a number of domestic and international laws protecting the privacy and security of personal information. these laws include us state laws such as the california consumer privacy act, as well as the general data protection regulation in the eu, eu member state directives, or similar applicable laws. these laws place limits on how we may collect, use, share and store personal information, and they impose obligations to protect that information. further, we may be subject to new data privacy and security laws and regulations. if we, or any of our service providers who have access to the personal data for which we are responsible, are found to be in violation of the privacy or security requirements of applicable data protection laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. although we utilize a variety of measures to secure the data that we control, even compliant entities can experience security breaches or have inadvertent failures despite employing reasonable practices and safeguards.
our revolving credit facility agreements expose us to certain risks.
from time to time, we have financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our revolving credit facilities. our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facilities may be limited if the lenders believe there has been a material adverse change to our business. in addition, our revolving credit facility agreements contain a number of customary financial covenants and restrictions, which may limit our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests, or otherwise respond to changing business and economic conditions, and may therefore have a material impact on our business. failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default, allowing our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. in addition, in some cases, a default under one revolving credit facility could result in a cross-default under other revolving credit facilities. certain of our revolving credit facility agreements bear interest at a rate that varies depending on the london interbank offered rate. any increases in interest rates applicable to borrowings under our credit facilities would increase our cost of borrowing, which would result in a decline in our net income and liquidity.
the tax laws applicable to our business are very complex and changes in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate, or audits by various taxing authorities may subject us to additional tax liabilities, and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.
we are subject to changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties in and between the jurisdictions in which we operate. these tax laws are highly complex, and significant judgment and specialized expertise is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision for income taxes. our tax expense is based on our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. a change in these tax laws, or in their interpretation, could result in a materially higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings. for example, the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act (tax reform act) resulted in changes to the existing us tax laws that have and will continue to affect us, and could impact our effective tax rate. in addition, in response to the pandemic, the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act (cares act) and american rescue plan act were signed into law, both of which contain numerous income tax provisions. this legislation made broad changes to the us tax code and we expect to see future regulatory or legislative guidance issued. if the guidance differs from our preliminary interpretation of the law, it could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. additional changes in tax laws or proposed regulations, interpretations and other changes to the tax reform act may ultimately be enacted in a future period, which could increase our income tax liability or adversely affect our long-term effective tax rates and net income, and we are continually monitoring and assessing proposed changes in tax laws and regulations. one example is the recently announced american families plan, which, if enacted into law, would increase the corporate tax rate and would implement other changes to existing tax law that may result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide results of operations.
many countries in the eu and around the globe have adopted or proposed changes to current tax laws. further, organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development have published action plans that, if adopted by countries where we do business, could increase our tax obligations in these countries. due to the large scale of our us and international business activities, many of these enacted and proposed changes could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. further, we are subject to tax audits in each of the various jurisdictions where we conduct business, and any of these jurisdictions may assess additional taxes against us as a result of these audits. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, and we undertake to prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical tax provisions and accruals. the results of a tax audit or other tax proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made and may require a restatement of prior financial reports.
risks related to our common stock our common stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantial losses for stockholders.
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. the trading price of our common stock could be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following:
•    changes in expectations of our future financial performance and results of operations;
•    changes in estimates of our performance by securities analysts and other market participants, or our failure to meet such estimates;
•    changes in our stockholder base or public actions taken by investors;
•    market research and opinions published by securities analysts and other market participants, and the response to such publications;
•    quarterly fluctuations in our sales, margins, expenses, financial position, and results of operations;
•    the financial stability of our customers, manufacturers, and suppliers;
•    legal proceedings, regulatory actions, and legislative changes;
•    announcements regarding the potential repurchase of our common stock, and our actual stock repurchase activity;
•    consumer confidence and discretionary spending levels;
•    broad market fluctuations in volume and price;
•    general market, political, and economic conditions, including recessionary conditions; and
•    a variety of risk factors, including the ones described herein and in our other sec filings.
in addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. accordingly, the price of our common stock is volatile and any investment in our stock is subject to risk of loss. these broad market and industry factors and other general macroeconomic conditions unrelated to our financial performance may also affect our common stock price.
anti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (certificate) and amended and restated bylaws (bylaws), as well as provisions of delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.
our certificate and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult hostile takeovers, change-in-control transactions, or changes in our board of directors or management. among other things, these provisions:
•    authorize the issuance of preferred stock with powers, preferences and rights that may be senior to our common stock, which can be created and issued by our board of directors without prior stockholder approval;
•    provide that the number of directors will be fixed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the whole board of directors;
•    prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent without holding a meeting of stockholders;
•    require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.
as a delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of delaware law, including section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which may delay, deter, or prevent a change-in-control transaction. any provision of delaware law, our certificate, or our bylaws, that has the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, deterring, or preventing a change-in-control transaction could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could affect the price that investors are willing to pay for our common stock.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report. this discussion includes an analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended march 31, 2021 and 2020 and year-over-year comparisons between those periods. for year-over-year comparisons between the years ended march 31, 2020 and 2019, refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2020 filed with the sec on june 1, 2020.
certain statements made in this section constitute "forward-looking statements," which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including those described in this section. refer to the section entitled "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" within this annual report for additional information.
overview we are a global leader in designing, marketing, and distributing innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high-performance activities. we market our products primarily under five proprietary brands: ugg, hoka, teva, sanuk and koolaburra. we believe that our products are distinctive and appeal to a broad demographic. we sell our products through quality domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to our global consumers through our direct-to-consumer (dtc) business, which is comprised of our e-commerce websites and retail stores. we seek to differentiate our brands and products by offering diverse lines that emphasize authenticity, functionality, quality, and comfort, and products tailored to a variety of activities, seasons, and demographic groups. all of our products are currently manufactured by independent third-party manufacturers.
trends and uncertainties impacting our business and industry we expect our business and the industry in which we operate will continue to be impacted by several important trends and uncertainties, as follows:
•    throughout fiscal year 2021, the covid-19 pandemic (referred to herein as the pandemic) spread globally, including throughout the geographic regions in which we operate our business, and in which our wholesale customers, retail stores, manufacturers, and suppliers are located.
•    the overall impacts of the pandemic on our business, and the businesses of our wholesale customers and partners, continue to be highly uncertain and subject to change, especially in light of the significant recent increases in the number of positive covid-19 cases in certain geographic regions. however, we believe that the actions we have taken to respond to the pandemic, combined with our strong brands, diversified product portfolio, and favorable liquidity position, have resulted in strong operational performance throughout the pandemic, and position us to emerge from the pandemic poised for continued long-term growth.
retail environment
•as a result of various government orders and restrictions imposed in connection with the pandemic, as well as changes in consumer behavior in response, we closed many of our company-owned-and-operated stores at various times during fiscal year 2021. the largest impact on our retail business was from disruption at tourism-dependent locations, including both limited capacity and closure requirements that impacted store traffic. however, approximately 77% of our global retail stores were open for our entire fourth fiscal quarter, although in most cases with limited capacity. we expect temporary retail store closures in certain geographies to continue for at least a portion of our first fiscal quarter ending june 30, 2021, and that there is risk of ongoing or additional retail stores closures and operating limitations based on expert agency guidance and local authority mandates.
•we expect the scope of allowable retail activities and retail consumer traffic patterns to vary by geographic region due to the continued impact of the pandemic, including those associated with governmental restrictions and consumer responses. in an attempt to mitigate the impact of operating our retail stores at limited capacity, we have continued expanding the use of technology at these locations. however, we could continue to experience decreased demand or capacity threshold constraints at our retail stores.
•we believe that many of our wholesale customers and retail partners have experienced temporary retail store closures similar to those impacting our company-owned retail stores. although many of our customers have reopened their retail stores, we believe that many of these stores continue to operate at limited capacity.
e-commerce environment
•we have observed a prolonged and meaningful shift in the way consumers shop for products and make purchasing decisions, evidenced by decreases in consumer retail store activity as consumers accelerated their migration to online shopping. these trends, which have been exacerbated by the impacts of the pandemic, have been positively impacting the performance of our e-commerce business, while creating headwinds for our traditional retail business, as well as the retail businesses of our wholesale customers and retail partners.
•we operate our e-commerce business through various websites and platforms, which have remained operational and experienced increased consumer traffic throughout the pandemic. we continue to look for ways to expand consumer access to and improve ease of use of our e-commerce platforms, which has contributed to increased consumer traffic.
•during fiscal year 2021, we observed strong demand for all of our brands within our e-commerce business. many of our wholesale customers also experienced strong demand trends for our brands, which have consistently experienced strong sell-through on our wholesale partners' e-commerce platforms. however, we do not expect that the growth rate that our e-commerce business experienced during fiscal year 2021 will continue in future periods.
brand strategy
•within the ugg brand, we have experienced strong sell-through in all channels of certain product lines, such as the slipper category, as consumers seek out luxurious comfort in the current work-from-home environment. in addition, the ugg brand continues to experience success with counter-seasonal products, such as spring and summer collections for women's, men's, and kids' categories. the brand is attracting new and younger, more diverse consumers, including through strategic fashion collaborations and design innovation. however, the brand continues to experience softness internationally within the wholesale channel. we expect to see continued ugg brand progress during fiscal year ending march 31, 2022 in europe due to our marketplace reset strategy, as well as in asia due to our localized marketing activations.
•as the ugg brand continues to amplify its audience with younger, more diverse consumers, it has been critical to continue our development of the brand's e-commerce channel and expanding its digital marketing presence. the ugg brand's e-commerce platform has continued to evolve as part of our overall digital transformation and has become a strategic driver of our product development process through the launch of exclusive products.
•within the hoka brand, we continue to see strong demand across our product offerings through both wholesale and dtc channels, which we believe is being fueled by an emphasis on running and outdoor exercise and introducing innovative products that resonate globally with younger, more diverse consumers. further, the hoka brand's performance was driven by balanced growth across the brand's ecosystem of access points. for example, the hoka brand's optimized digital marketing increased online consumer acquisition and retention rates, which we believe will collectively continue to drive dtc channel revenues as a percentage of total brand revenue.
supply chain
•we maintain a network of strategic sourcing partners which includes material vendors and third-party manufacturers. we experienced certain capacity constraints within our sourcing network during fiscal year 2021. while we have mitigated the effects of these disruptions, it is possible that we will experience additional disruptions to our supply chain, including from shipping delays and container shortages from congestion at port facilities, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic. congestion at united states (us) and international ports could affect the capacity at ports to receive deliveries of products or the loading of shipments on to vessels. in anticipation of this, we are evaluating mitigation strategies.
•our warehouse and dc in moreno valley, california, as well as our global third-party logistics providers (3pls) and third-party carriers, remain open although they continue to operate at reduced capacity. we are experiencing certain operational and logistical challenges as a result of limited and modified operations. this includes challenges associated with shipping higher quantities of product through our e-commerce channel compared to prior periods in parallel with increased nationwide demand placed on delivery companies, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic. these impacts may continue to have an adverse effect on our ability to fulfill orders through our e-commerce platform.
•we continue to recognize the need for additional infrastructure investments to support our scaling business, including investments in and upgrades to our end-to-end planning systems as well as our global distribution and logistics capabilities. for example, we are currently in the early stages of opening a new us dc located in mooresville, indiana that is intended to expand our logistical capabilities. at the same time, we are encountering challenges in attracting and retaining quality candidates to staff our dc operations in the us as we increasingly compete with other companies with growing e-commerce operations.
omni-channel strategy
•we have implemented a channel and product segmentation strategy, as well as franchise management for key product allocation strategies for the ugg brand's core classics franchise, in the us wholesale marketplace. these strategies are designed to assist us in controlling product inventory, reducing the impact of discounts and closeouts on our sales and gross margins, and increasing full-priced selling across our product offerings. similarly, we have implemented a multi-year marketplace reset strategy in europe and asia to drive ugg brand demand and build a foundation of diversified product acceptance, which is driving a healthier product mix and reducing the need for promotional activity.
•as a result of changes in consumer purchasing behavior, we continue to enhance our omni-channel strategy to bolster our e-commerce capabilities and enable us to better engage with consumers and expose them to our brands. our strategy is transforming the way we approach marketing, including through a sustained focus on digital marketing efforts, as well as localized marketing activations and authentic collaborations to drive global brand demand. we have also enhanced our focus on adaptive digital marketing as we seek to target consumers within the work-from-home environment and promote products that are desirable based on current consumer preferences, working conditions, and lifestyle choices.
•to mitigate the adverse impacts the pandemic has had on our business and operations, we implemented a number of temporary measures to reduce our operating expenses. as we return to a more normal business environment, we expect to make significant investments related to our infrastructure and other strategic initiatives to support opportunities to further scale our business.
reportable operating segment overview our six reportable operating segments include the worldwide wholesale operations of the ugg brand, hoka brand, teva brand, sanuk brand, and other brands, as well as dtc (collectively, our reportable operating segments). information reported to the chief operating decision maker (codm), who is our chief executive officer, president, and principal executive officer, is organized into these reportable operating segments and is consistent with how the codm evaluates our performance and allocates resources.
ugg brand. the ugg brand is one of the most iconic and recognized brands in our industry, which highlights our successful track record of building niche brands into lifestyle and fashion market leaders. with loyal consumers around the world, the ugg brand has proven to be a highly resilient line of premium footwear, apparel, and accessories with expanded product offerings and a growing global audience that appeals to a broad demographic.
we believe demand for ugg brand products will continue to be driven by the following:
•high consumer brand loyalty due to consistent delivery of quality and luxuriously comfortable footwear, apparel, and accessories.
•diversification of our footwear product offerings, such as women's spring and summer lines, as well as expanded category offerings for men's products.
•expanding apparel, home goods, and accessories business.
hoka brand. the hoka brand is an authentic premium line of year-round performance footwear and apparel that offers enhanced cushioning and inherent stability with minimal weight. originally designed for ultra-runners, the brand now appeals to world champions, taste makers, and everyday athletes. the hoka brand is quickly becoming a leading brand within run specialty wholesale accounts, with strong marketing fueling both domestic and international sales growth, driving the brand's net sales to continue to increase as a percentage of our aggregate net sales. we continue to build product extensions in trail and fitness.
we believe demand for hoka brand products will continue to be driven by the following:
•leading product innovation and key franchise management.
•increased brand awareness and adoption through enhanced global marketing activations and online customer acquisition, including building a more diverse outdoor community.
•category extensions in authentic performance footwear offerings such as lifestyle acceleration through the trail and hiking categories.
teva brand. the teva brand created the very first sport sandal when it was founded in the grand canyon in 1984. since then the teva brand has grown into a multi-category modern outdoor lifestyle brand offering a range of performance, casual, and trail lifestyle products, and has emerged as a leader in footwear sustainability observed through recent growth fueled by young and diverse consumers passionate for the outdoors and the planet. we believe demand for teva brand products will continue to be driven by the following:
•authentic outdoor heritage and a reputation for quality, comfort, sustainability, and performance in any terrain.
•increasing brand awareness due to outdoor lifestyle participation amongst younger consumers.
•category extensions in performance hike footwear.
sanuk brand. the sanuk brand originated in southern california surf culture and has emerged into a lifestyle brand with a presence in the relaxed casual shoe and sandal categories with a focus on innovation in comfort and sustainability. the sanuk brand's use of unexpected materials and unconventional constructions, combined with its fun and playful branding, are key elements of the brand's identity.
other brands. other brands consist primarily of the koolaburra by ugg brand. the koolaburra brand is a casual footwear fashion line using sheepskin and other plush materials and is intended to target the value-oriented consumer in order to complement the ugg brand offering.
direct-to-consumer. our dtc business for all our brands is comprised of our retail stores and e-commerce websites which, in an omni-channel marketplace, are intertwined and interdependent. we believe many of our consumers interact with both our retail stores and websites before making purchasing decisions.
e-commerce business. our e-commerce business provides us with an opportunity to communicate a consistent brand message to consumers that is in line with our brands' promises, drives awareness of key brand initiatives, offers targeted information to specific consumer demographics, and drives consumers to our retail stores. as of march 31, 2021, we operated our e-commerce business through company-owned websites and mobile platforms in 58 different countries, for which the net sales are recorded in our dtc reportable operating segment.
retail business. our retail stores are predominantly ugg brand concept stores and ugg brand outlet stores. through our outlet stores, we sell some of our discontinued styles from prior seasons, full price in-line products, as well as products made specifically for the outlet stores.
as of march 31, 2021, we had a total of 140 global retail stores, which includes 71 concept stores and 69 outlet stores. generally, we open retail store locations during our second or third fiscal quarters and consider closures of retail stores during our fourth fiscal quarter; however, the timing of such openings and closures may vary. we evaluate potential retail store closures based on historic and anticipated store performance and timing of lease expirations and options. while we expect to identify additional stores for closure, we may simultaneously identify opportunities to open new stores in the future to further enhance our overall dtc business. we currently do not anticipate incurring material incremental retail store closure costs, primarily because any store closures we may pursue are expected to occur as, or near to when, retail store leases expire to avoid incurring potentially significant lease termination costs, as well as through conversions to partner retail stores, further discussed below. we will continue to evaluate our retail store fleet strategy in response to changes in consumer demand and retail store traffic patterns.
flagship stores. included in the total count of global concept stores are seven ugg brand flagship stores, which are lead concept stores in certain key markets and prominent locations designed to showcase the ugg brand products. primarily located in major tourist locations, these stores are typically larger with broader product offerings and greater traffic than our general concept stores. we anticipate operating a curated fleet of flagship stores to enhance the interaction with our consumers and increase brand loyalty. for example, in november 2020 we opened a flagship store in new york city, which highlights the expansive collection of the brand's product offerings while showcasing the breadth and depth of ugg as a lifestyle brand. the net sales for these stores are recorded in our dtc reportable operating segment.
shop-in-shop stores. included in the total count of global concept stores are 26 shop-in-shop (sis) stores, defined as concept stores for which we own the inventory and that are operated by us or non-employees within a department store, which we lease from the store owner by paying a percentage of sis store sales. the net sales for these stores are recorded in our dtc reportable operating segment.
partner retail stores. we rely on partner retail stores for the ugg brand and hoka brand. partner retail stores are branded stores that are wholly owned and operated by third-parties and not included in the total count of global retail stores. when a partner retail store is opened, or a store is converted into a partner retail store, the related net sales are recorded in each respective brand wholesale reportable operating segments, as applicable.
use of non-gaap financial measures throughout this annual report we provide certain financial information on a constant currency basis, excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which we disclose in addition to the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (us gaap). we provide these non-gaap financial measures to provide information that may assist investors in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. however, the information included within this annual report that is presented on a constant currency basis, as we present such information, may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled information presented by other companies, and may not be appropriate measures for comparing the performance of other companies relative to us. for example, in order to calculate our constant currency information, we calculate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period, excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate hedges and remeasurements in the consolidated financial statements.
further, we report comparable dtc sales on a constant currency basis for dtc operations that were open throughout the current and prior reporting periods, and we may adjust prior reporting periods to conform to current year accounting policies.
these non-gaap financial measures are not intended to represent and should not be considered to be more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with us gaap. constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation as an alternative to us dollar measures that reflect current period foreign currency exchange rates or to other financial measures presented in accordance with us gaap. we believe evaluating certain financial and operating measures on a constant currency basis is important as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are not indicative of our core results of operations and are largely outside of our control.
seasonality our business is seasonal, with the highest percentage of ugg and koolaburra brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending september 30th and december 31st and the highest percentage of teva and sanuk brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending march 31st and june 30th. net sales for the hoka brand occur more evenly throughout the year reflecting the brand's year-round performance product offerings. due to the magnitude of the ugg brand relative to our other brands, our aggregate net sales in the quarters ending september 30th and december 31st still significantly exceed our aggregate net sales in the quarters ending march 31st and june 30th. as we continue to take steps to diversify and expand our product offerings by creating more year-round styles, and as net sales of the hoka brand continue to increase as a percentage of our aggregate net sales, we expect the impact from seasonality to continue to decrease over time. however, it is unclear whether seasonal impacts will be minimized or exaggerated in future periods as a result of the disruptions and uncertainties caused by the pandemic. refer to note 14, "quarterly summary of information (unaudited)," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information on our results of operations by quarterly period.

total net sales increased primarily due to higher dtc sales as well as higher hoka brand wholesale sales, partially offset by lower ugg brand, teva brand, and sanuk brand wholesale sales. further, we experienced an increase of 13.9% in total volume of pairs sold to 41,900 from 36,800 compared to the prior period. on a constant currency basis, net sales increased by 18.4%, compared to the prior period. drivers of significant changes in net sales, compared to the prior period, were as follows:
•dtc net sales increased due to higher e-commerce net sales across all brands, partially offset by lower retail sales attributed to lower tourism traffic and store closures related to the pandemic. due to the meaningful disruption of our retail store base for closures, we are not reporting a comparable dtc net sales metric for the year ended march 31, 2021.
•wholesale net sales of the hoka brand increased primarily due to global expansion of market share, including reaching new customers, driven by increased brand awareness combined with key franchise updates.
•wholesale net sales of the ugg brand decreased primarily due to lower international sales, partially offset by strong domestic sales. the global wholesale channel was impacted by lower global sell-in of product, driven by pandemic related sales losses resulting from decreased store traffic and more conservative purchasing from our global wholesale partners. international wholesale sales were also lower due to the near-term impact of the marketplace reset strategies in europe and asia.
•wholesale net sales of the teva brand and sanuk brand decreased primarily due to the pandemic related sales losses during our first fiscal quarter caused by decreased store traffic for our wholesale customers during the respective brands' peak sell-in period.
•international net sales, which are included in the reportable operating segment net sales presented above, represented 30.8% and 34.3% of total net sales for the years ended march 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. international net sales increased by 7.3%, compared to the prior period, primarily due to higher net sales for the hoka brand across all channels in europe and asia, partially offset by lower net sales in both these regions in the wholesale and retail channels for the ugg brand. the decrease in international net sales as a percentage of total sales was driven by higher domestic sales growth, primarily due to higher e-commerce sales.
gross profit. gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross margin, increased to 54.0% from 51.8%, compared to the prior period, primarily due to favorable channel mix resulting from increased penetration of dtc, higher full-priced selling, favorable brand mix, and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher freight costs.
•increased payroll costs of approximately $50,700, primarily due to higher performance-based compensation, including long-term incentive plan performance-based restricted stock units, as well as warehousing costs for higher headcount and wages.
•increased variable advertising and promotion expenses of approximately $44,000, primarily due to higher digital marketing and advertising for the ugg brand and hoka brand to drive brand demand and awareness.
•increased other variable net selling expenses of approximately $21,500, including information technology, as well as transaction and warehousing fees and shipping supplies, primarily due to higher dtc sales and commissions, partially offset by insurance recovery proceeds.
•increased impairments of operating lease and long-lived assets of approximately $16,300 due to flagship retail store impairments driven by lower traffic and strategic changes in the fleet, as well as lower retail sales and early store closures, and an impairment loss for international intangible assets for the sanuk brand.
•increased depreciation expense of approximately $2,600 due to an increase in capital projects.
•decreased variable operating expenses of approximately $18,000, primarily due to lower travel related expenses, as well as lower sales meeting expenses related to the impacts of the pandemic.
•decreased rent and occupancy expenses of approximately $8,500, primarily due to lower retail store operating costs, including due to company-owned retail store closures related to the pandemic and lower company-owned retail store count.
•decreased foreign currency-related losses of $5,400, primarily driven by favorable changes in canadian, european, and chinese foreign currency exchange rates.

the increase in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, primarily driven by dtc and hoka brand wholesale, partially offset by higher sg&a expenses. drivers of significant net changes in total income from operations, compared to the prior period, were as follows:
•the increase in income from operations of dtc was due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, as well as lower company-owned retail store operating costs, partially offset by higher variable marketing and selling expenses, as well as higher e-commerce expenses.
•the increase in income from operations of hoka brand wholesale was primarily due to higher net sales, partially offset by higher variable marketing expenses.
•the decrease in income from operations of ugg brand wholesale was due to lower net sales at lower gross margins as well as higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower variable selling expenses.
•the increase in income from operations of other brands wholesale was due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher variable marketing expenses.
•the increase in loss from operations of sanuk brand wholesale was primarily due the impairment of a definite-lived international trademark, as well as lower net sales at lower gross margins, partially offset by lower variable selling and marketing expenses.
•the increase in unallocated overhead costs was primarily due to higher performance-based compensation, as well as warehousing expenses, including for payroll and outside services, in addition to higher information technology expenses, and higher depreciation expenses, partially offset by lower foreign currency-related losses driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, insurance recovery proceeds, and lower travel related expenses.
the increase in our effective income tax rate, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of worldwide income before income taxes for the year ended march 31, 2021 in jurisdictions with higher effective tax rates, higher non-deductible executive compensation, as well as less favorable settlement of tax audits, partially offset by higher employee share based compensation excess tax benefits.
foreign income before income taxes was $133,186 and $134,755 and worldwide income before income taxes was $501,514 and $340,866 during the years ended march 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. the decrease in foreign income before income taxes as a percentage of worldwide income before income taxes, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to higher domestic sales and higher foreign operating expenses as a percentage of worldwide sales.
for the years ended march 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not generate significant pre-tax earnings from any countries which do not impose a corporate income tax. a small portion of our unremitted accumulated earnings of non-us subsidiaries, for which no us federal or state income tax have been provided, are currently expected to be reinvested outside of the us indefinitely. such earnings would become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries. refer to the section titled "liquidity" below for further information.
we expect our foreign income or loss before income taxes, as well as our effective income tax rate, will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on several factors, including the impact of our global product sourcing organization, our actual results of operations from sales generated in domestic and foreign markets, and changes in domestic and foreign tax laws (or in the application or interpretation of those laws). foreign income before income taxes will continue to grow in the long-term, in both absolute terms and as a percentage of worldwide income before income taxes, as we focus on the global composition of our business, localized strategies for international markets, and investments in international regions. in addition, we believe our effective income tax rate will be impacted by our actual foreign income or loss before income taxes relative to our actual worldwide income or loss before income taxes. for further information on the impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act (tax reform act), refer to note 5, "income taxes," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report.
net income. the increase in net income, compared to the prior period, was due to higher net sales at higher gross margins, partially offset by higher sg&a expenses. net income per share increased, compared to the prior period, due to higher net income, combined with lower weighted-average common shares outstanding, driven by stock repurchases in prior periods.
total other comprehensive income, net of tax. the increase in total other comprehensive income, net of tax, compared to the prior period, was due to higher foreign currency translation gains relating to changes to our net asset position for favorable asian and european foreign currency exchange rates.
liquidity we finance our working capital and operating requirements using a combination of our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash provided from ongoing operating activities and, to a lesser extent, available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. our working capital requirements begin when we purchase raw materials and inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting trade accounts receivable. given the historical seasonality of our business, our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout the fiscal year, and we are required to utilize available cash to build inventory levels during certain quarters in our fiscal year to support higher selling seasons.
while we are subject to uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balances, cash provided from ongoing operating activities, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our working capital requirements and timely service our debt obligations for at least the next 12 months.
we repatriated $175,000 and $150,000 of cash and cash equivalents during the years ended march 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. as of march 31, 2021, we had $180,951 of cash and cash equivalents outside the us and held by all foreign subsidiaries, a portion of which may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes if it were to be repatriated. at march 31, 2019, we completed the calculation of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiaries' earnings pursuant to the tax reform act and previously recorded a net cumulative tax expense of $57,895, net of foreign tax credits. beginning with the tax year ended march 31, 2018, an installment election was made to pay these taxes over eight years with 40% paid in equal installments over the first five years and the remaining 60% to be paid in installments of 15%, 20% and 25% in years six, seven and eight, respectively. the cumulative remaining balance as of march 31, 2021 is $41,452. we continue to evaluate our cash repatriation strategy and we currently anticipate repatriating current and future unremitted earnings of non-us subsidiaries, to the extent they have been and will be subject to us tax, if such cash is not required to fund ongoing foreign operations. our cash repatriation strategy, and by extension, our liquidity, may be impacted by several additional considerations, which include clarifications of or changes to the tax reform act and our actual earnings for current and future periods. for further information on the impacts of the tax reform act, refer to note 5, "income taxes," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report.
we continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy, and to consider further opportunities to utilize our global cash resources in a way that will profitably grow our business, meet our strategic objectives and drive stockholder value, including by potentially repurchasing additional shares of our common stock. as of march 31, 2021, the aggregate remaining approved amount under our stock repurchase program was $60,660. our board of directors approved an additional authorization of $750,000 during april 2021 to repurchase our common stock under the same conditions as the prior stock repurchase program. subsequent to march 31, 2021 through may 13, 2021, we repurchased 70,881 shares for $23,466 at an average price of $331.06 per share, and had $787,194 remaining authorized under the stock repurchase program. our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any amount of common stock and may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
our liquidity may be further impacted by additional factors, including our results of operations, the strength of our brands, impacts of seasonality and weather conditions, our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences and tastes, the timing of capital expenditures and lease payments, our ability to collect our trade accounts receivables in a timely manner and effectively manage our inventories, our ability to respond to the impacts and disruptions caused by the pandemic, and our ability to respond to economic, political and legislative developments. furthermore, we may require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions, strategic initiatives, or stock repurchase strategy, a national or global economic recession, or other future developments, including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue, although we do not have any present commitments with respect to any such investments or acquisitions.
if our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements, we may seek to borrow under our revolving credit facilities, seek new or modified borrowing arrangements, or sell additional debt or equity securities. the sale of convertible debt or equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and equity securities may have rights or preferences that are superior to those of our existing stockholders. the incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in additional debt service obligations, as well as covenants that would restrict our operations and further encumber our assets. in addition, there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
capital resources primary credit facility. in september 2018, we refinanced in full and terminated our second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of november 13, 2014, as amended. the refinanced revolving credit facility agreement (credit agreement) is with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. (jpmorgan), as the administrative agent, citibank, n.a., comerica bank (comerica) and hsbc bank usa, n.a., as co-syndication agents, mufg bank, ltd. and us bank national association as co-documentation agents, and the lenders party thereto, with jpmorgan and comerica acting as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners. the credit agreement provides for a five-year, $400,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (primary credit facility), contains a $25,000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit, and matures on september 20, 2023.
as of march 31, 2021, we had no outstanding balance, outstanding letters of credit of $549, and available borrowings of $399,451 under our primary credit facility.
china credit facility. our revolving credit facility in china (china credit facility) is an uncommitted revolving line of credit of up to cny 300,000, or $45,736.
as of march 31, 2021, we had no outstanding balance, outstanding bank guarantees of $30, and available borrowings of $45,706 under our china credit facility.
japan credit facility. our revolving credit facility in japan (japan credit facility) is an uncommitted revolving line of credit of up to jpy 3,000,000, or $27,099. we renewed the japan credit facility through january 31, 2022 substantially under the terms of the original credit agreement.
as of march 31, 2021, we had no outstanding balance and had available borrowings of $27,099 under our japan credit facility.
debt covenants. as of march 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities.

2021                                                               2020                                       change amount                         amount               amount                         %
net cash provided by operating activities          $596,217                       $286,334                    $309,883           108.2                 %
net cash used in investing activities              (32,169)                       (31,964)                    (205)                          (0.6)
net cash used in financing activities             (129,581)                      (192,114)                    62,533             32.5
operating activities. our primary source of liquidity is net cash provided by operating activities, which is primarily driven by our net income, other cash receipts and expenditure adjustments, and changes in working capital.
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended march 31, 2021, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to a net positive change in operating assets and liabilities of $185,994 and net income after non-cash adjustments of $123,889. the changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to net positive changes in inventories, net, accrued expenses, trade accounts payable, income taxes payable, and income tax receivable, partially offset by net negative changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and trade accounts receivable, net. the positive change in inventories, net, made up a majority of the net positive change in operating assets and liabilities, which was driven by higher net sales and lower inventory on-hand due to more disciplined purchasing that focused on key products in response to the pandemic, as well as the positive change in accrued expenses, primarily driven by higher payroll related accruals.
investing activities. the net cash used in investing activities during the year ended march 31, 2021, was consistent with the prior period, and was primarily comprised of capital expenditures for improvements to our warehouse and dc, the build-out or refreshes made to our retail store locations, as well as information technology.
financing activities. the decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended march 31, 2021, compared to the prior period, was primarily due to lower stock repurchases occurring in the current period, partially offset by repayment of the mortgage in full on our corporate headquarters.
purchase obligations for product (2)                  566,820                    566,820                            -                  -                          -
purchase obligations for commodities (3)              150,594                    114,342                       36,252                  -                          -
net unrecognized tax benefits (5)                       6,359                      1,038                        5,321                  -                          -
(1)our operating lease commitments consist primarily of building leases for our retail locations, our warehouse and dc, and regional offices, and include the undiscounted cash lease payments owed under the terms of our operating lease agreements. in addition to the above operating lease commitments outstanding, there is $20,284 of legally binding minimum lease payments due pursuant to a lease signed but not yet commenced, nor recorded in our consolidated financial statements, as of march 31, 2021 for a new us distribution center. refer to note 7, "leases and other commitments," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information on our operating lease assets and liabilities.
(2)our purchase obligations for product consist mostly of open purchase orders issued in the ordinary course of business. outstanding purchase orders are primarily issued to our third-party manufacturers and are expected to be paid within one year. we can cancel a significant portion of the purchase obligations under certain circumstances; however, the occurrence of such circumstances is generally limited. as a result, the amount does not necessarily reflect the dollar amount of our binding commitments or minimum purchase obligations, and instead reflects an estimate of our future payment obligations based on information currently available. due to increased demand for certain products combined with the impacts of the pandemic that may result in supply chain disruptions, we are currently expecting that our inventory purchases with our third-party manufacturers will be significantly higher for the fiscal year ending march 31, 2022 compared to prior fiscal years.
(3)our purchase obligations for commodities include sheepskin and leather, and represent remaining commitments under existing supply agreements, which are subject to minimum volume commitments. we expect that purchases made by us under these agreements in the ordinary course of business will eventually exceed the minimum commitment levels.
during the year ended march 31, 2021, we experienced a shift in product mix that used less of a certain sheepskin grade. as a result, we negotiated a deferral of additional deposit payments, which represent remaining minimum commitments under certain expired sheepskin supply agreements. as of march 31, 2021, the remaining minimum purchase commitment under these expired agreements was approximately $28,000. subsequent to march 31, 2021 through may 13, 2021, this deposit was paid.
(4)our other purchase obligations consist of non-cancellable minimum commitments for logistics arrangements, an it agreement for a new inventory planning system, requirements to pay promotional expenses, and other commitments under service contracts, which are due during fiscal years 2022 through 2026. amounts excluded from other purchase obligations above include any capital expenditures that will be purchased before the end of the fiscal year ending march 31, 2022, which we estimate will range from approximately $65,000 to $70,000. we anticipate these expenditures will primarily relate to the build-out of our new us dc, it infrastructure and system upgrades, and refreshes to our global retail store fleet including new retail stores. other anticipated expenditures include upgrades to our existing warehouse and dc as well as our global office facilities. however, the actual amount of our future capital expenditures may differ significantly from this estimate depending on numerous factors, including the timing of facility openings, as well as unforeseen needs to replace existing assets, and the timing of other expenditures.
(5)net unrecognized tax benefits are defined as gross unrecognized tax benefits, less federal benefit for state income taxes, related to uncertain tax positions taken in our income tax return that would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized. as of march 31, 2021, the timing of future cash outflows is highly uncertain related to statute of limitations liabilities of $17,524, therefore we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement. refer to note 5, "income taxes," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information on our uncertain tax positions.
refer to note 7, "leases and other commitments," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information on our operating leases, purchase obligations, capital expenditures, and other contractual obligations and commitments.
impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had an incremental positive impact on the year ended march 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended march 31, 2020.
refer to "results of operations," above within this part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and note 9, "derivative instruments," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information on the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations.
critical accounting policies and estimates management must make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements, based on historical experience, existing and known circumstances, authoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable, but actual results could differ materially from these estimates. management believes the following critical accounting estimates are most significantly affected by judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: allowances for doubtful accounts; estimated returns liability; sales discounts and customer chargebacks; inventory valuations; valuation of goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets; and performance-based stock compensation. the full impact of the ongoing pandemic is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated for these key estimates. however, we made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. to the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.
refer to note 1, "general," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and use of estimates, as well as the impact of recent accounting pronouncements.
revenue recognition. revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is completed at a point in time and when the customer has obtained control. control passes to the customer when they have the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from, the goods transferred. the amount of revenue recognized is based on the transaction price, which represents the invoiced amount less known actual amounts or estimates of variable consideration. we recognize revenue and measure the transaction price net of taxes, including sales taxes, use taxes, value-added taxes, and some types of excise taxes, collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities. we present revenue gross of fees and sales commissions. sales commissions are expensed as incurred and are recorded in sg&a expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
wholesale and international distributor revenue are each recognized either when products are shipped or when delivered, depending on the applicable contract terms. retail store and e-commerce revenue are recognized at the point of sale and upon shipment, respectively. shipping and handling costs paid to third-party shipping companies are recorded as cost of sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. shipping and handling costs are a fulfillment service, and, for certain wholesale and all e-commerce transactions, revenue is recognized when the customer is deemed to obtain control upon the date of shipment.
refer to note 2, "revenue recognition," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information regarding the components of variable consideration, including allowances for sales discounts, chargebacks, and our sales return liability.
accounts receivable allowances. the following table summarizes critical accounting estimates for accounts receivable allowances and reserves:
allowance for doubtful accounts            (9,730)                          (4.0)                       (6,989)                          (3.4)
allowance for sales discounts              (3,016)                          (1.2)                       (1,030)                          (0.5)
allowance for chargebacks                 (13,770)                          (5.8)                      (13,127)                          (6.3)
allowance for doubtful accounts. we provide an allowance against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers' inability to pay. we determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts, aged trade accounts receivable, economic conditions and forecasts, historical experience, and the customers' creditworthiness. trade accounts receivable that are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance. the allowance includes specific allowances for trade accounts, of which all or a portion are identified as potentially uncollectible based on known or anticipated losses. our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results. for example, a 1.0% change in the rate used to estimate the reserve for accounts which we consider having credit risk and are not specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts as of march 31, 2021 by approximately $1,800.
allowance for sales discounts. we provide a trade accounts receivable allowance for sales discounts for our wholesale channel sales, which reflects a discount that our customers may take, generally based on meeting certain order, shipment or prompt payment terms. we use the amount of the discounts that are available to be taken against the period end trade accounts receivable to estimate and record a corresponding reserve for sales discounts.
allowance for chargebacks. we provide a trade accounts receivable allowance for chargebacks and markdowns from wholesale customers. when customers pay their invoices, they may take deductions against their invoices that can include chargebacks for price differences, markdowns, short shipments, and other reasons. therefore, we record an allowance for known or unknown circumstances based on historical trends related to the timing and amount of chargebacks taken against wholesale channel customer invoices.
sales return liability. the following tables summarize estimates for our sales return liability as a percentage of the most recent quarterly net sales by channel:
direct-to-consumer             235,082                           41.9                          144,233                           38.5
amount                          % of net sales            amount                          % of net sales sales return liability wholesale                     $(23,987)                         (7.4)      %            $(21,846)                         (9.5)      %
direct-to-consumer            (13,730)                          (5.8)                   (3,821)                           (2.6)
reserves are recorded for anticipated future returns of goods shipped prior to the end of the reporting period. in general, we accept returns for damaged or defective products for up to one year. we also have a policy whereby returns are generally accepted from customers between 30 to 90 days from the point of sale for cash or credit. amounts of these reserves are based on known and actual returns, historical returns, and any recent events that could result in a change from historical return rates. sales returns are an asset for the right to recover the inventory and a refund liability for the stand-ready right of return. changes to the refund liability are recorded against gross sales and changes to the asset for the right to recover the inventory are recorded against cost of sales. for our wholesale channel, we base our estimate of sales returns on any approved customer requests for returns, historical returns experience, and any recent events that could result in a change from historical returns rates, among other factors. for our dtc channel and reportable operating segment, we estimate sales returns using a lag compared to the same prior period and consider historical returns experience and any recent events that could result in a change from historical returns, among other factors. our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results. for example, a 1.0% change in the rate used to estimate the percentage of sales expected to ultimately be returned would change the sales return liability as of march 31, 2021 by approximately $5,000.
inventory reserves. the following tables summarize estimates for our inventory reserves:
write-down of inventories           (19,632)                              (6.6)                        (12,227)                              (3.8)
we review inventory on a regular basis for excess, obsolete, and impaired inventory to evaluate write-downs to the lower of cost or net realizable value. our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results. for example, a 10.0% change in the estimated selling prices of our potentially obsolete inventory would change the inventory write-down reserve as of march 31, 2021 by approximately $1,600.
operating lease assets and lease liabilities. key accounting policy elections for the new lease standard applied to our consolidated financial statements are as follows:
•we recognize operating lease assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets on the lease commencement date, based on the present value of the outstanding lease payments over the reasonably certain lease term. the lease term includes the non-cancelable period at the lease commencement date, plus any additional periods covered by our options to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) a lease that is controlled by the lessor.
•we discount unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if the rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate (ibr). generally, we cannot determine the interest rate implicit in the lease because we do not have access to the lessor's estimated residual value or the amount of the lessor's deferred initial direct costs. therefore, we generally derive a discount rate at the lease commencement date by utilizing our ibr, which is based on what we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to our lease payments under similar terms. because we do not currently borrow on a collateralized basis under our revolving credit facilities, we use the interest rate we pay on our non-collateralized borrowings under our primary credit facility as an input for deriving an appropriate ibr, adjusted for the amount of the lease payments, the lease term, and the effect on that rate of designating specific collateral with a value equal to the unpaid lease payments for that lease.
refer to note 7, "leases and other commitments," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information, including more details of our accounting policy elections and disclosures.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. we do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets but instead test for impairment annually, or when an event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable at the reporting unit level. first, we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. qualitative factors considered include significant or adverse changes in customer demand, historical financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, macroeconomic and industry conditions, and the legal and regulatory environment. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. the quantitative assessment requires an analysis of several best estimates and assumptions, including future sales and results of operations, discount rates, and other factors that could affect fair value or otherwise indicate potential impairment. we also consider the reporting units' projected ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods, as well as perceived changes in customer demand and acceptance of products, or factors impacting the industry generally. the fair value assessment could change materially if different estimates and assumptions were used.
during the years ended march 31, 2021 and 2020, we performed our annual impairment assessment and evaluated the ugg and hoka brands' wholesale reportable operating segment goodwill as of december 31st and evaluated our teva indefinite-lived trademarks as of october 31st. based on the carrying amounts of the ugg and hoka brands' goodwill and teva brand indefinite-lived trademarks, each of the brands' actual fiscal year sales and results of operations, and the brands' long-term forecasts of sales and results of operations as of their evaluation dates, we concluded that these assets were not impaired.
refer to note 1, "general," and note 3, "goodwill and other intangible assets," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and annual impairment assessment results.
definite-lived intangible and other long-lived assets. definite-lived intangible and other long-lived assets, including definite-lived trademarks, machinery and equipment, internal-use software, operating lease assets, and leasehold improvements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. at least quarterly, we evaluate factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment, which include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others.
when an impairment-triggering event has occurred, we test for recoverability of the asset group's carrying value using estimates of undiscounted future cash flows based on the existing service potential of the applicable asset group. in determining the service potential of a long-lived asset group, we consider the remaining useful life, cash-flow generating capacity, and physical output capacity. these estimates include the undiscounted future cash flows associated with future expenditures necessary to maintain the existing service potential. these assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. if impaired, the asset or asset group is written down to fair value based on either discounted future cash flows or appraised values. an impairment loss, if any, would only reduce the carrying amount of long-lived assets in the group based on the fair value of the asset group.
during the year ended march 31, 2021, we recorded an impairment loss of $3,522 for the sanuk brand definite-lived international trademark, driven by the strategic decision to focus primarily on future domestic growth, within our sanuk brand wholesale reportable operating segment in sg&a expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. we did not identify any definite-lived intangible asset impairments during the year ended march 31, 2020.
during the years ended march 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded impairment losses for other long-lived assets, primarily for certain retail store operating lease assets and related leasehold improvements due to performance or store closures, of $14,084 and $1,365, respectively, within our dtc reportable operating segment in sg&a expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
refer to note 1, "general," and note 3, "goodwill and other intangible assets," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information on our definite-lived intangible and other long-lived assets.
performance-based compensation. in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we recognize performance-based compensation expense, including performance-based stock compensation and annual cash bonus compensation, when it is deemed probable that the applicable performance criteria will be met. performance-based compensation does not include time-based awards subject only to service-based conditions. we evaluate the probability of achieving the applicable performance criteria on a quarterly basis. our probability assessment can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we assess our projected results against performance criteria. as a result, the related performance-based compensation expense we recognize may also fluctuate from period to period.
at the beginning of each fiscal year, our compensation committee reviews our results of operations from the prior fiscal year, as well as the financial and strategic plan for future fiscal years. our compensation committee then establishes specific annual financial and strategic goals for each executive. vesting of performance-based stock compensation or recognition of cash bonus compensation is based on our achievement of certain targets for annual revenue, operating income, pre-tax income, and earnings per share, as well as achievement of predetermined individual financial performance criteria that is tailored to individual employees based on their roles and responsibilities with us. the performance criteria, as well as our annual targets, differ each fiscal year and are based on many factors, including our current business stage and strategies, our recent financial and operating performance, expected growth rates over the prior fiscal year's performance, business and general economic conditions and market and peer group analysis.
performance-based compensation expense increased approximately $28,300 during the year ended march 31, 2021 compared to the year ended march 31, 2020. the primary reason for this increase was the achievement of the maximum performance criteria for the 2020 and 2019 long-term incentive plan restricted stock units as well as the over achievement of the performance criteria governing our cash bonuses compared to the prior period. performance-based compensation expense is primarily recorded in sg&a expenses, with cash bonuses for certain employees recorded in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
refer to note 8, "stock-based compensation," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information on our performance-based stock compensation.
income taxes. income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover our deferred tax assets. in the event that we determine all or part of our net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, we will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made.
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of us gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recorded in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
we determine on a regular basis the amount of undistributed earnings that will be indefinitely reinvested in our non-us operations. this assessment is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our us and foreign subsidiaries. a cash distribution of income from foreign subsidiaries that was previously taxed earnings and profits (ptep) by the us internal revenue service does not require recognition of a deferred tax liability as the liability has already been recognized under the tax reform act. we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment assertion of foreign earnings other than ptep.
refer to note 5, "income taxes," of our consolidated financial statements in part iv within this annual report for further information on our income taxes and tax strategy.

item 1a:                     risk factors this risk factors section contains references to our capital stock and to our stockholders.  unless expressly stated otherwise, the references to our capital stock represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock, while the references to our stockholders represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock.
in order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties.  the acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures.
we face competition in the acquisition and operation of property. we expect competition from:
·                  other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.
some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. this competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.
negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, re-lease space, collect rent or renew leases, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.
cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. we could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:
·                  inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;
·                  declines in our tenants creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations, the current economic situation and competition within their industries from other operators;
·                  defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants, failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations;
·                  deterioration of the physical condition of our properties.
at any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. as a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent, or declare bankruptcy. any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenants lease and material losses to us.
if tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties.  furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements, or lease transaction costs. negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness. a significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. in a weakened financial condition, tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them.
further, the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenants lease or leases. in addition, a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us. if that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases or we may elect not to pursue claims against the tenant for terminated leases. in addition, any claim we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full, or at all. moreover, in the case of tenants leases that are not terminated as a result of its bankruptcy, we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions, reducing amounts we receive under those leases. as a result, tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  any of these events could adversely affect cash from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness.
seventy of our properties were available for lease or sale at december 31, 2014, all of which were single-tenant properties. at december 31, 2014, thirty-nine of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current with their rent and other obligations. during 2014, each of our tenants accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue.
individually, each of the industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue for 2014. nevertheless, downturns in these industries could also adversely affect our tenants, which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common and preferred stock.
in addition, some of our properties are leased to tenants that may have more limited financial and other resources, and therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional, national, or international economy.
furthermore, we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-tenant, net lease retail locations in the united states. we may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and/or new jurisdictions outside the united states and properties leased to tenants engaged in non-retail businesses. for example, our acquisition of arct included tenants in the aerospace, freight, governmental services, healthcare, home maintenance, manufacturing, pharmacy, retail banking, technology, and telecommunications businesses, some of which are non-retail businesses and none of which was in an industry segment that was within our property portfolio prior to our acquisition of arct.  these risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties, new types of real estate locations and lease structures, and the laws and culture of any non-u.s. jurisdiction.
as a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities.
investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. an owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. we can face such liability regardless of:
there may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware. in that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators of oil change and tune-up facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products. these facilities, and some other of our properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances.
the presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims. although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest. there also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition, or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness.
in addition, several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings with asbestos in the future. environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or acms, and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately
inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.
it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and/or that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. our tenants are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of tenants activities on the properties. for properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the tenants generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations, including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements, obtaining environmental insurance, or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation.  however, it is possible that one or more of our tenants could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations, and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities.
compliance.  we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability, or claim relating to hazardous substances, toxic substances, or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties. in addition, we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal, state, and local laws relating to acms. nevertheless, if environmental contamination should exist, we could be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest.
insurance and indemnity.  in july 2012, we entered into a ten-year environmental insurance policy that expires in july 2022 and replaced our previous seven-year environmental insurance policy. the limits on our current policy are $10 million per occurrence and $60 million in the aggregate.  the limits on the excess policy are $5 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate.  therefore, the primary and excess ten-year policies together provide a total limit of $15 million per occurrence and $70 million in the aggregate.
it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. our tenants are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties.  for properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation.
if we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities.
commencing with our taxable year ended december 31, 1994, we believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the code. however, we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a reit, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit.
qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.
for example, in order to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).
in the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.
if we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a reit, we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to qualify as a reit.  if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year:
·                  we could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost;
·                  this treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.
even if we qualify for and maintain our reit status, we may be subject to certain federal, state, and local taxes on our income and property. for example, if we have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100% tax. in addition, our taxable reit subsidiaries, including crest, are subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property.  any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.
distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility.
to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding net capital gains, each year. we also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.
in addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years.
we intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit.
future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock.
our future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. if we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. the interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans. likewise, our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by our board of directors). accordingly, our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock.
we may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets.
we have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership, which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that, under certain circumstances, may
be exchanged for shares of our common stock.  this acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of, or refinance the debt on, the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain.  similarly, we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases.  these restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.
we are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing.
we intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility. at december 31, 2014, we had $223.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, a total of $3.8 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities (excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of $14.6 million), $70 million of borrowings outstanding under a senior unsecured term loan and approximately $836.0 million of outstanding mortgage debt (excluding net premiums totaling $16.6 million on these mortgages). to the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. as a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt. we also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our acquisition credit facility, our term loan and some of our mortgage debt are variable and could therefore increase over time.  we also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. given past disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing global financial crisis, we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our acquisition credit facility may not be able to lend us money.
in addition, our acquisition credit facility, term loan facility, and mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions on our common stock and preferred stock.  in particular, our acquisition credit facility provides that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit facility) exists, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make any dividends or other distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock, during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of:
·                  the sum of (a) 95% of our adjusted funds from operations (as defined by the credit facility agreement) for that period plus (b) the aggregate amount of cash distributions on our preferred stock for that period, and
·                  the minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our shareholders in order to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes, except that we may repurchase or redeem preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock. the acquisition credit facility further provides that, in the event of a failure to pay principal, interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to any of our subsidiaries that have guaranteed amounts payable under the credit facility or that meet a significance test set forth in the credit facility, we and our subsidiaries may not pay any dividends or other distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock.  if any such event of default under our acquisition credit facility were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities, could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable on our common stock and preferred stock or prevent us from paying those dividends or other distributions altogether, and may adversely affect our ability to qualify, or prevent us from qualifying, as a reit.  likewise, one of our subsidiaries is the borrower under our $70 million term loan facility and that facility requires that this subsidiary maintain its consolidated tangible net worth (as defined in the term loan facility) above a certain minimum dollar amount and comply with certain other financial covenants.  this minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant may limit the ability of this subsidiary, as well as other subsidiaries that are owned by this subsidiary, to provide funds to us in order to pay dividend and other distributions on our common stock, including the shares of common stock offered hereby, and preferred stock and amounts due on our indebtedness.  any failure by this subsidiary to comply with these financial covenants will, and any failure by this subsidiary to comply with other covenants in the term loan facility may, result in an event of default under that facility, which could have adverse consequences similar to those that may result from an event of default under our acquisition credit facility as described above.
our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock and debt securities, including:
·                  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
·                  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;
·                  requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and general corporate requirements;
·                  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and
·                  putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.
our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.
our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness, and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.
the market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.
the market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control, including:
·                  prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities;
·                  the market for similar securities issued by other reits;
·                 general economic and financial market conditions;
·                  the financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our tenants and our competitors;
·                  litigation and regulatory proceedings;
·                  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry;
·                  changes in our credit ratings; and
·                  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.
in addition, over the last several years, prices of common stock and debt securities in the u.s. trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations, and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period. as a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.
real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue.
we are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate.  in particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur, and distributions on our capital stock. additional real estate ownership risks include:
·                  adverse changes in general or local economic conditions;
·                  competition for tenants;
·                  inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases;
·                  inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;
·                  uninsured property liability;
·                  unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;
real estate investments are relatively illiquid. our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. no assurances can be given that we will recognize full value, at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us, for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.
we are engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, underwriting, and negotiating possible acquisition transactions. we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions. our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions.
an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.
under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. additionally, tenants are generally required, at the tenants expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. the insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily excluded improvements. our tenants are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates.
in addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above, many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by the tenants as part of their risk management programs. additionally, we have obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the tenants fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss. however, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. we also face the risk that our insurance carriers may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies, and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire.
in addition, although we obtain title insurance policies of our properties to protect us and our properties against unknown title defects (such as claims of ownership, liens or other encumbrances), there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover. if a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property, cause a financial misstatement or lead to reputational damage to the company.
compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations.
our properties are generally required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990, or the ada. the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities, but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the u.s. government or an award of damages to private litigants. the retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions, and we believe that these retailers may be obligated to cover costs associated with compliance. if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. in addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.
litigation risks could affect our business.
from time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims. an unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management.
property taxes may increase without notice.
the real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities.
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. the loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. it is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry.
natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations.
natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations, the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. there can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our tenants, our business or the united states generally.
if events like these were to occur, they could materially interrupt our business operations, cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the u.s. and worldwide financial markets and economy. they also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the u.s. or abroad. any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities. it could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.
we rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.
we rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information. although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning, or the theft of intellectual property, personal information, or personal property, such as in the event of cyber-attacks. any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, result in theft of company assets, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock.
over the last several years, the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. in addition, the ongoing global financial crisis (which includes concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt) has had a similar effect. these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. unrest in certain middle eastern countries and resultant fluctuation in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets.  continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms, which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions. a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. in addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing. these events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock or debt securities. these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties, as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general.
inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. likewise, even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect the tenants ability to pay rent.
current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements.
various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments), and various receivables. often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess, as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict. although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates, it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates.
inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement accuracy and safeguarding of assets. any failure of these internal controls could result in decreased investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, civil litigation or investigations by the nyse, the sec or other regulatory authorities, which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.
the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, in conjunction with the sec, has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions, including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board. at this time, we are unable to predict with certainty which, if any, proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements, our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants.
campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. if we become engaged in a process or proxy contest with an activist stockholder in the future, our business could be adversely affected, as such activities could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan. additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of stockholder activism or actual or potential changes to the composition of our board of directors or management team may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to current or potential sellers of properties, tenants and financing sources, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. if potential or existing sellers of properties, tenants or financing sources choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our results of operations could be adversely affected. similarly, we may suffer damage to our reputation (for example, regarding our corporate governance or stockholder relations) or brand by way of actions taken or statements made by outside constituents, including activist investors and shareholder advisory firms, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock and the value of our debt securities, including the notes, resulting in significant loss of value, which could impact our ability to access capital, increase our cost of capital, and decrease our ability to acquire properties on attractive terms.
item 7: managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income, the monthly dividend company®, is a publicly traded real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations.  our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from our property portfolio. we have in-house acquisition, portfolio management, asset management, credit research, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting, information technology, and capital markets capabilities. over the past 46 years, realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements.
realty income (nyse: o) was founded in 1969, and in 1994 was listed on the nyse.  we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or reit, requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).
we seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties.
·                  with an occupancy rate of 98.4%, or 4,257 properties leased and 70 properties available for lease;
·                  with over 70.7 million square feet of leasable space; and
·                  with an average leasable space per property of approximately 16,350 square feet, including approximately 11,290 square feet per retail property.
of the 4,327 properties in the portfolio, 4,308, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining are multi-tenant properties. at december 31, 2014, of the 4,308 single-tenant properties, 4,238 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 10.2 years.
liquidity and capital resources capital philosophy historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. in addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities. however, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.
our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the table of obligations, which is presented later in this section. we expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowing on our $1.5 billion credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings.
conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. at december 31, 2014, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, term loan, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $4.93 billion, or approximately 30.6% of our total market capitalization of $16.11 billion.
we define our total market capitalization at december 31, 2014 as the sum of:
·                  shares of our common stock outstanding of 224,881,192, plus total common units of 816,568, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of $47.71 per share on december 31, 2014, or $10.77 billion;
·                  outstanding borrowings of $223.0 million on our credit facility;
mortgage debt as of december 31, 2014, we had $836.0 million of mortgages payable, all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions.  additionally, at december 31, 2014, we had net premiums totaling $16.6 million on these mortgages.
we expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that will make it economically feasible to do so.  during 2014, we made $85.2 million of principal payments, including the repayment of six mortgages in full for $77.8 million.
term loan in january 2013, in conjunction with our acquisition of arct, we entered into a $70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in january 2018.  borrowing under the term loan bears interest at libor, plus 1.20%.  in conjunction with this term loan, we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 2.15%.
$1.5 billion acquisition credit facility we have a $1.5 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility with an initial term that expires in may 2016 and includes, at our election, a one-year extension option. under this credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate, commonly referred to as libor, plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% over libor. the borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling. we also have other interest rate options available to us under this credit facility. our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.
at december 31, 2014, we had a borrowing capacity of $1.28 billion available on our credit facility (subject to customary conditions to borrowing) and an outstanding balance of $223.0 million.  the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, at december 31, 2014, was 1.2% per annum.  we must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility.  at december 31, 2014, we remain in compliance with these covenants. we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes. any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. we regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend or replace our credit facility, to the extent we deem appropriate.
we generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. thereafter, when capital is available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. we cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms.
in september 2014, we issued $250 million of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due october 2026, or the 2026 notes.  the price to the investors for the 2026 notes was 99.499% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 4.178% per annum.  a portion of the total net proceeds of approximately $246.4 million from this offering was used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, and the remaining proceeds were used for other general corporate purposes and working capital, including additional property acquisitions.
in june 2014, we issued $350 million of 3.875% senior unsecured notes due july 2024, or the 2024 notes.  the price to the investors for the 2024 notes was 99.956% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 3.88% per annum.  the total net proceeds of approximately $346.7 million from this offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility.
cash reserves we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties.  we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital.  at december 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $3.9 million.
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months.  we intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility.
acquisitions during 2014
during 2014, we invested $1.4 billion in 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 7.1%. the 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 42 states, will contain approximately 9.8 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. the tenants occupying the new properties operate in 32 industries and the property types consist of 85.7% retail, 6.6% industrial and distribution, 6.4% office, and 1.3% manufacturing, based on rental revenue.  none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10% or more of our total assets at december 31, 2014.
the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate base rent under the lease for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property.  since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.
in the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return.  when the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows: estimated net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs. of the $1.4 billion we invested during 2014, $81.9 million was invested in 40 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 8.4%.  we may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future.
of the 203 properties re-leased during 2014, 173 properties were re-leased to existing tenants, nine were re-leased to new tenants without vacancy, and 21 were re-leased to new tenants after a period of vacancy.  the annual rent on these 203 leases was $33.9 million, as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of $34.2 million.
at december 31, 2014, our average annualized rental revenue was approximately $13.07 per square foot on the 4,257 leased properties in our portfolio.  at december 31, 2014, we classified eight properties with a carrying amount of $14.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. the disposal of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results.
investments in existing properties in 2014, we capitalized costs of $6.0 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $821,000 for re-leasing costs and $5.2 million for building and tenant improvements.  in 2013, we capitalized costs of $8.5 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $1.3 million for re-leasing costs and $7.2 million for building and tenant improvements.
as part of our re-leasing costs, we typically pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions.  leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal.  we do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations.
the majority of our building and tenant improvements relate to roof repairs, hvac improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements.  it is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives.  the amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, tenant credit worthiness, and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases.
impact of real estate and credit markets in the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. likewise, during certain periods, the u.s. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. we continually monitor the commercial real estate and u.s. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly. see our discussion of risk factors in this annual report.
increases in monthly dividends to common stockholders we have continued our 46-year policy of paying monthly dividends.  in addition, we increased the dividend four times during 2014, and two times during 2015.  as of february 2015, we have paid 69 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 79 times since our listing on the nyse in 1994.
universal shelf registration in february 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in february 2016. this replaces our prior shelf registration statement.  in accordance with sec rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. the securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. the specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.
issuance of common stock in april 2014, we issued 13,800,000 shares of common stock, including 1,800,000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares.  after underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $22.8 million, the net proceeds of $528.6 million were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility.
dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan in march 2011, we established a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, or the drspp, to provide our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions.  the drspp also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions.  the drspp authorizes up to 6,000,000 common shares to be issued.  during 2014, we issued 3,527,166 shares and raised approximately $158.5 million under the drspp.
credit agency ratings the borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. we are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds:  moodys investors service has assigned a rating of baa1 with a stable outlook, standard & poors ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb+ with a stable outlook to our senior notes, and fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb+ with a stable outlook.
based on our current ratings, the current facility interest rate is libor plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% over libor.  the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) libor plus 1.85% if our credit rating is lower than bbb-/baa3 and (ii) libor plus 1.00% if our credit rating is a-/a3 or higher.  in addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which range from: (i) 0.45% for a rating lower than bbb-/baa3, and (ii) 0.15% for a credit rating of a-/a3 or higher.
we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease.
the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.
notes outstanding our senior unsecured note and bond obligations consist of the following as of december 31, 2014, sorted by maturity date (dollars in millions):
all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates and contain various covenants, which we remain in compliance with at december 31, 2014. additionally, interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually.
the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our senior notes and bonds. these calculations, which are not based on u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or gaap, measurements, are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our senior notes and bonds as well as to disclose our current compliance with such covenants, and are not measures of our liquidity or performance.  the actual amounts as of december 31, 2014 are:
limitation on incurrence of total debt          ≤ 60% of adjusted assets    43.8%
limitation on incurrence of secured debt        ≤ 40% of adjusted assets     7.6%
(1) this covenant is calculated on a pro forma basis for the preceding four-quarter period on the assumption that: (i) the incurrence of any debt (as defined in the covenants) incurred by us since the first day of such four-quarter period and the application of the proceeds therefrom (including to refinance other debt since the first day of such four-quarter period), (ii) the repayment or retirement of any of our debt since the first day of such four-quarter period, and (iii) any acquisition or disposition by us of any asset or group since the first day of such four-quarters had in each case occurred on january 1, 2014, and subject to certain additional adjustments.  such pro forma ratio has been prepared on the basis required by that debt service covenant, reflects various estimates and assumptions and is subject to other uncertainties, and therefore does not purport to reflect what our actual debt service coverage ratio would have been had transactions referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence occurred as of january 1, 2014, nor does it purport to reflect our debt service coverage ratio for any future period.  the following is our calculation of debt service coverage at december 31, 2014 (in thousands, for trailing twelve months):
fixed charge coverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as the debt service coverage ratio, except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator.  similar to debt service coverage ratio, we consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a companys ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments.  our calculations of both debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios may be different from the calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.  the presentation of debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios should not be considered as alternatives to any u.s. gaap operating performance measures.  below is our calculation of fixed charges at december 31, 2014 (in thousands, for trailing twelve months):
table of obligations the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december 31, 2014 (dollars in millions):
leases          leases notes                                                 paid by         paid by year of       credit                  and      term       mortgages                        realty             our maturity       facility(1)        bonds(2)      loan      payable(3)     interest(4)     income(5)      tenants(6)      other(7)        totals
(1)                             the initial term of the credit facility expires in may 2016 and includes, at our option, a one-year extension, which has been assumed to occur in the table above.
(4)   interest on the term loan, notes, bonds, mortgages payable, and credit facility has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december 31, 2014 through their respective maturity dates.
(7)   other consists of $33.6 million of commitments under construction contracts and $735,000 of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs.
our credit facility and notes payable obligations are unsecured. accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations.
preferred stock and preferred units outstanding in 2006, we issued 8,800,000 shares of class e preferred stock at a price of $25.00 per share. since december 2011, the shares of class e preferred stock were redeemable at our option, for $25.00 per share. in october 2014, we redeemed all of the 8,800,000 shares of our class e preferred stock for $25.00 per share, plus accrued dividends. we incurred a charge of $6.0 million, representing the class e preferred stock original issuance costs that we paid in 2006.
in february 2012, we issued 14.95 million shares of our class f preferred stock at $25.00 per share. in april 2012, we issued an additional 1.4 million shares of class f preferred stock at $25.2863 per share. beginning february 15, 2017, shares of our class f preferred stock are redeemable at our option for $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. dividends on the shares of our class f preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears. we are current on our obligations to pay dividends on our class f preferred stock.
as part of our acquisition of arct in january 2013, we issued 6,750 partnership units, with a carrying value of $6.75 million. payments on these preferred units are made monthly in arrears at rate of 2% per annum, or $135,000, and are included in interest expense. in january 2015, we redeemed all 6,750 tau operating partnership preferred units for $1,000 per unit, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
no unconsolidated investments we have no unconsolidated investments, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts.
results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap, and are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap, many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies. one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties. depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 25 to 35 years for buildings and 4 to 15 years for improvements, which we believe are appropriate estimates of useful life. if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.
management must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  when acquiring a property for investment purposes, we typically allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to: (1) land, (2) building and improvements, and (3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their estimated fair values. intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market or below-market lease value of in-place leases, the value of in-place leases, and tenant relationships, as applicable.  in an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties.  the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and is often based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located.  in addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued noncontrolling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values. the estimated fair values of our mortgages payable have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable interest rates that have been adjusted for factors, such as industry type, tenant investment grade, maturity date, and comparable borrowings for similar assets.  the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on managements preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available.  subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year.  the use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired properties and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenue and expenses.
another significant judgment must be made as to if, and when, impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property. key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates, estimated holding periods, capital expenditures, and property sales capitalization rates. if a property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell. the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheets. our strategy of primarily holding properties, long-term, directly decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable, thus requiring the recognition of an impairment. however, if our strategy, or one or more of the above assumptions were to change in the future, an impairment may need to be recognized. if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment, they could have a material impact on our results of operations.
for purposes of determining the same store rent property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entire year-to-date period, for both the current and prior year except for properties during the current or prior year that; (i) were vacant at any time, (ii) were under development or redevelopment, and (iii) were involved in eminent domain and rent was reduced. each of the exclusions from the same store pool is separately addressed within the applicable sentences above explaining the changes in rental revenue for the period.
of the 4,327 properties in the portfolio at december 31, 2014, 4,308, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties and the remaining nineteen are multi-tenant properties. of the 4,308 single-tenant properties, 4,238, or 98.4%, were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 10.2 years at december 31, 2014. of our 4,238 leased single-tenant properties, 3,789 or 89.4% were under leases that provide for increases in rents through:
our portfolio of real estate, leased primarily to regional and national tenants under net leases, continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders.  at december 31, 2014, our portfolio of 4,327 properties was 98.4% leased with 70 properties available for lease as compared to 98.2% occupancy, or 70 properties available for lease at december 31, 2013. it has been our experience that approximately 2% to 4% of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time; however, it is possible that the number of properties available for lease could exceed these levels in the future.
tenant reimbursements contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses were $37.1 million in 2014, compared to $24.9 million in 2013 and $14.6 million in 2012.  the increase in tenant reimbursements from 2013 to 2014 is primarily due to our 2013 and 2014 acquisitions.  our tenant reimbursements are equal to our reimbursable property expenses for any given period.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was $374.7 million in 2014, compared to $306.8 million in 2013 and $147.5 million in 2012. the increases in depreciation and amortization in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2014 and 2013, which was partially offset by property sales in those same years.  as discussed in the sections entitled funds from operations available to common stockholders (ffo) and adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders (affo), depreciation and amortization is a non-cash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo and affo.

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by $5.8 million to $51.1 million in 2014, as compared to $56.9 million in 2013. general and administrative expenses were $38.1 million in 2012.  included in general and administrative expenses are acquisition transaction costs (excluding arct merger-related costs) of $453,000 for 2014, $2.1 million for 2013 and $2.4 million for 2012. general and administrative expenses decreased during 2014 primarily due to lower stock compensation costs, including the $3.7 million for accelerated vesting that occurred in july 2013, and lower acquisition transaction costs. in january 2015, we had 125 employees, as compared to 116 employees in january 2014 and 97 employees in january 2013.
property expenses consist of costs associated with unleased properties, non-net leased properties and general portfolio expenses, as well as contractually obligated reimbursements from tenants for recoverable real estate taxes and operating expenses. expenses related to unleased properties and non-net leased properties include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections, bad debt expense and legal fees. general portfolio costs include, but are not limited to, insurance, legal, property inspections, and title search fees. at december 31, 2014, 70 properties were available for lease, as compared to 70 at december 31, 2013 and 84 at december 31, 2012.
property expenses were $53.9 million (including $37.1 million reimbursable) in 2014, $38.9 million (including $24.9 million reimbursable) in 2013 and $21.3 million (including $14.6 million reimbursable) in 2012. the increase in property expenses in 2014 is primarily attributable to the increased portfolio size, which contributed to higher maintenance and utilities, property taxes, ground rent expenses, legal costs, and bad debt expense, along with higher contractually obligated reimbursements primarily due to our 2013 and 2014 acquisitions, partially offset by lower insurance costs.
income taxes income taxes were $3.5 million in 2014, as compared to $2.4 million in 2013 and $1.1 million in 2012. these amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income and its subsidiaries.  the increase for 2014 is primarily related to higher city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income and its subsidiaries, primarily related to increased portfolio size.
merger-related costs merger-related costs include, but are not limited to, advisor fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing fees and transfer taxes related to our acquisition of arct.  merger-related costs were $13.0 million in 2013 and $7.9 million in 2012.  on a diluted per common share basis, these expenses represented $0.07 for 2013 and $0.06 for 2012.  no merger-related costs were incurred in 2014.
crest sold one property for $820,000 and one property for $597,000 during 2014 and 2013, respectively.  neither of these sales resulted in a gain. the results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations.  during 2012, crest did not sell any properties.
·                  enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;
at december 31, 2014, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $14.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. in 2015, we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately $50 million in yet to be identified property sales for all of 2015.  we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. however, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties.
discontinued operations during the first quarter of 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued guidance that changes the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have, or will have, a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results.  we early adopted the requirements of this accounting pronouncement in the first quarter of 2014.  as a result, our results of operations for all disposals and properties classified as held for sale that were not previously reported in discontinued operations in our 2013 annual report on form 10-k are presented within income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income.
net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders was $227.6 million in 2014, compared to $203.6 million in 2013, an increase of $24.0 million. on a diluted per common share basis, net income was $1.04 in 2014, as compared to $1.06 in 2013, a decrease of $0.02, or 1.9%.  net income available to common stockholders was $114.5 million in 2012. net income available to common stockholders for 2014 includes a non-cash redemption charge of $6.0 million on the shares of class e preferred stock that were redeemed in october 2014, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis. this charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006. net income available to common stockholders for 2013 was impacted by an unusually large gain on property sales, which represents $0.18 on a diluted per common share basis.  additionally, net income available to common stockholders for 2013 includes $13.0 million of merger-related costs for the acquisition of arct, which represents $0.07 on a diluted per common share basis, and $3.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from ten-year vesting to five years, which represents $0.02 on a diluted per common share basis.
redemption value over the carrying value of the class e preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006.  ffo in 2013 and 2012 was normalized to exclude $13.0 million and $7.9 million of merger-related costs, which represents $0.07 and $0.06 on a diluted per common share basis for 2013 and 2012, respectively.  ffo for 2013 includes $3.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in july 2013 from ten-year vesting to five years, which represents $0.02 on a diluted per common share basis.   all references to ffo for 2013 and 2012 reflect the adjustments for merger-related costs for the acquisition of arct.

(2)   the computation of diluted ffo does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible to common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted ffo per share in a given period.
we define ffo, a non-gaap measure, consistent with the national association of real estate investment trusts definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairments of depreciable real estate assets, reduced by gains on property sales and extraordinary items.  our ffo for 2013 and 2012 has also been normalized to exclude arct merger-related costs.
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reits operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back items such as depreciation and impairments for ffo. the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a reit, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure. in addition, ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility.

(2)                 includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in march 2003, november 2003, march 2005, september 2005, september 2006, september 2007, june 2010, june 2011, october 2012, july 2013, june 2014 and september 2014.  additionally, this includes the amortization of deferred financing costs incurred and capitalized in connection with our assumption of the mortgages payable and the issuance of our term loan.  the deferred financing costs are being amortized over the lives of the respective mortgages and term loan.  no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included.
(3)                 includes adjustments allocable to both non-controlling interests and capital lease obligations.
(4)                 the computation of diluted affo does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible to common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted affo per share in a given period.
we believe the non-gaap financial measure affo provides useful information to investors because it is a widely accepted industry measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that is used by industry analysts and investors who look at and compare those companies.  in particular, affo provides an additional measure to compare the operating performance of different reits without having to account for differing depreciation assumptions and other unique revenue and expense items which are not pertinent to measuring a particular companys on-going operating performance.  therefore, we believe that affo is an appropriate supplemental performance metric, and that the most appropriate gaap performance metric to which affo should be reconciled is net income available to common stockholders.
presentation of the information regarding ffo and affo is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits, although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo and affo in the same way, so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful. furthermore, ffo and affo are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance. ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.  in addition, ffo and affo should not be considered as measures of liquidity, of our ability to make cash distributions, or of our ability to pay interest payments.
impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes, increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), or fixed increases. we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation.

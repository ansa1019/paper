item 1a. risk factors cautionary statement about forward-looking statements we describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition, results of operations and in other parts of this report (including this item 1a). such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934.
forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. they are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. they are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. these forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this form 10-k, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on forms 10-q and 8-k.
risk factors our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.
macroeconomic and industry risks industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.
   aerospaceoperating results of our business units within aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. the operating results of our commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket business units may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impacts business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. operating results in our defense and space systems business unit may be affected by the mix of u.s. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs. operating results in our transportation systems business unit may be affected by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays in launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms.
   automation and control solutionsoperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, and inventory levels in distribution channels.
   performance materials and technologiesoperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. pricing of certain chemical products are driven by
raw materials that are correlated to the price of oil, hence revenue could be significantly impacted by volatility in the price of oil.
an increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-u.s. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.
our international operations, including u.s. exports, represent more than half of the companys sales. risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.
operating outside of the united states also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. however, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in eliminating such volatility. finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the united states that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. while we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss.
a change in the level of u.s. government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact aerospaces defense and space sales and results of operations.
a shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations.
risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.
significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. with regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.
operational risks raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.
the cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in pmt (cumene, fluorspar, r240, natural gas, perchloroethylene, sulfur and ethylene) and aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices
to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.
many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.
failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.
our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. in addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to employee attrition. we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations.
our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in highly competitive markets with acceptable margins.
our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.
the failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.
we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.
we regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. we may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. in addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies, (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.
as a supplier of military and other equipment to the u.s. government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the u.s. government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.
u.s. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. our contracts with the u.s. government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. when appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.
we are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. if, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.
our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.
mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. in addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.
global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (it) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers. while we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the company. we seek to deploy comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our it networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers. the potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.
legal and regulatory risks our u.s. and non-u.s. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.
our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives.
changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.
the sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. within aerospace, the operating results of our commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket business units may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. our defense and space business unit may be effected by changes in government procurement regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact the transportation systems business unit. within acs, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. pmts results of operations can be affected by environmental, safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations.
we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.
we are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. while we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. the incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of honeywell international inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (honeywell or the company) for the three years ended december 31, 2014. all references to notes relate to notes to financial statements in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data.
in april 2014, the company announced the realignment of our honeywell process solutions business from automation and control solutions (acs) into performance materials and technologies (pmt). the company has reported its financial performance based on the inclusion of honeywell process solutions in performance materials and technologies for all periods presented.
in july 2014, following the closing of the sale of its friction materials business, the company announced the realignment of its transportation systems business segment with its aerospace business segment. under the realigned segment reporting structure, the company has three business segments: aerospace, automation and control solutions and performance materials and technologies. the company has reported its financial performance based on the inclusion of transportation systems in aerospace for all periods presented.
these realignments have no impact on the companys historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
executive summary for honeywell, 2014 represented a year of strong performance despite a continued slow growth global environment. honeywells 2014 revenues were $40.3 billion representing a 3% improvement compared to 2013 revenues of $39.1 billion. our segment profit improved by 5%, more than one and one-half times revenue growth, evidencing the companys continued focus on operational excellence. we achieved strong segment profit expansion while reinvesting in our businesses through seed planting and continued focus on effective repositioning. the companys operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent, methodical application of several key internal business processes, the honeywell enablers, which drive improvements in organizational efficiency and service quality, bringing world-class products and services to markets faster and more cost effectively for our customers. we continued to execute on our key strategies for growth including penetration of high growth regions and investments in high return capital expenditures and new products and technologies, while maintaining our cost disciplines and leveraging the honeywell enablers.
the company continues to invest for future growth as measured by a number of important metrics:
   r&amp;d spending at 4.7% of revenues was targeted at such high growth areas as natural gas processing, low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents, avionics equipment and technology, connected voice and wireless control devices and technologies, software and mobile app development and data science to deliver value.
   capital expenditures of $1,094 million (in addition to $947 million in 2013) principally related to the construction and expansion of aerospace and pmt manufacturing facilities, as well as continued investment in our acs facilities.
   the company recognized $184 million of charges relating to repositioning actions to support sustainable productivity in years to come.
   the company continued to monitor its portfolio of businesses to ensure they fit our long-term strategic plan. in 2014, the company sold its friction materials business for approximately $155 million. in addition, the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire datamax-oneil,
a global manufacturer of fixed and mobile printers, for $185 million (the transaction is expected to close in early 2015).
   expansion of honeywells presence and sales in high growth regions and countries such as china, india, latin america, the middle east and eastern europe. sales to customers outside the united states increased by 5% in 2014 and now account for approximately 55% of total revenues.
   operating cash flow grew by 16% in 2014 to $5,024 million. this operating cash flow performance enabled us to invest $1,094 million in capital expenditures, repay $600 million in long-term debt, provide a 15% increase in the companys cash dividend rate (vs. 2013) and repurchase 10.0 million shares of common stock.

% change compared with prior period                            2%                      
cost of products and services sold increased in 2014 compared with 2013 principally due to an increase in direct material and labor costs of approximately $645 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions, net of divestitures) and an increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $35 million, partially offset by a decrease in repositioning and other charges of approximately $40 million.
gross margin percentage increased in 2014 compared with 2013 principally due to higher gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 0.7 percentage point impact collectively) and lower repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact), partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefit expense (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact).
cost of products and services sold increased in 2013 compared with 2012 principally due to an increase in direct material costs of approximately $585 million and indirect material costs of approximately $115 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions) and increased repositioning and other charges of approximately $140 million partially offset by a decrease in pension expense of approximately $760 million, primarily driven by the $650 million decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately $30 million in 2013 versus approximately $680 million in 2012).
gross margin percentage increased in 2013 compared with 2012 principally due to lower pension expense (approximately 2.0 percentage point impact primarily driven by the decrease in the pension mark-to-market adjustment allocated to cost of products and services sold), higher segment gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact collectively) and lower other postretirement expense (0.1 percentage point impact) partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.4 percentage point impact).
selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a) increased in 2014 compared with 2013 as a percentage of sales primarily driven by an estimated $435 million increase in labor costs (primarily acquisitions, incentive compensation, merit increases and investment for growth) and an estimated $30 million increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense, partially offset by a $25 million decrease in repositioning charges.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2013 compared with 2012 as a percentage of sales primarily driven by (i) higher sales as a result of the factors discussed in the review of business segments section of this md&a, (ii) an estimated $270 million decrease in pension expense primarily driven by an approximately $250 million decrease in the pension mark-to-market charge allocated to sg&a (approximately $20 million in 2013 versus approximately $270 million in 2012) partially offset by an estimated $215 million increase in labor costs (primarily acquisitions, merit increases and investment for growth) and an $80 million increase in repositioning charges.
for discussion of income taxes and the effective income tax rate, see note 5 income taxes in the notes to financial statements.
the effective income tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 reflect pension mark-to-market adjustments and tax benefits associated with lower tax rates on non-u.s. earnings, the vast majority of which we intend to permanently reinvest outside the united states.
earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to increased segment profit in each of our business segments and lower repositioning and other charges, partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement expense and increased tax expense.
earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower pension expense, increased segment profit in each of our business segments and higher other income, partially offset by increased tax expense and higher repositioning and other charges.
business overview our consolidated operating results are principally impacted by:
   change in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;
   overall sales mix, in particular the mix of aerospace original equipment and aftermarket sales and the mix of acs products, distribution and services sales;
   the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the euro), relative to the u.s. dollar;
   the extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation; and
   the impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements.
our 2015 areas of focus are supported by the honeywell enablers, including the honeywell operating system (hos gold), velocity product development, functional transformation and the honeywell user experience. these areas of focus are generally applicable to each of our operating segments and include:
   driving profitable growth through r&amp;d, technological excellence and optimized manufacturing capability to deliver innovative products that customers value;
   expanding margins by maintaining and improving the companys cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other actions, which will drive productivity and enhance the flexibility of the business as it works to proactively respond to changes in end market demand;
   proactively managing raw material costs through formula and long-term supply agreements and hedging activities, where feasible and prudent;
   driving strong cash flow conversion through effective working capital management which will enable the company to undertake strategic actions to benefit the business including capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, and returning cash to shareholders;
   driving inorganic growth through the identification of appropriate acquisition targets and deployment of our disciplined, rigorous m&amp;a and integration processes;
   aligning and prioritizing capital expenditures for long-term growth, while considering short-term demand volatility;
   monitoring both suppliers and customers for signs of liquidity constraints, limiting exposure to any resulting inability to meet delivery commitments or pay amounts due, and identifying alternate sources of supply as necessary; and
   controlling corporate and other non-operating costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement expenses and tax expense.

2014 compared with 2013
aerospace sales decreased primarily due to the friction materials divestiture and an increase in incentive payments due to air transport and regional and business and general aviation original equipment (oe) manufacturers (oem incentive payments), partially offset by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below.
   commercial original equipment sales decreased by 2% (increased by 3% organic) primarily due to an increase in oem incentive payments to air transport and regional oe manufacturers, partially offset by higher air transport volumes, consistent with the oe manufacturers higher production rates, and business and general aviation engine shipments.
   commercial aftermarket sales increased by 3% driven primarily by higher sales of spare parts to air transport and regional customers, partially offset by a decline in retrofits, modifications and
upgrades and lower repair and overhaul activities for our business and general aviation customers.
   transportation systems sales decreased by 3% (increased by 5% organic) primarily due to the friction materials divestiture, partially offset by continued growth from new platform launches, higher global turbo gas penetration and increased commercial vehicle demand in europe.
aerospace segment profit increased by 2% due to an 8% increase in operational segment profit, partially offset by a 6% unfavorable impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other (predominantly higher oem incentive payments and the absence of a prior year royalty gain), as discussed above. the increase in operational segment profit is driven primarily by favorable price and productivity, net of inflation. cost of products and services sold totaled $11.7 billion in 2014, a decrease of $190 million, primarily due to the factors discussed above (excluding price).
2013 compared with 2012
aerospace sales increased primarily due to favorable pricing, increased volumes in our commercial original equipment business and increased licensing revenue (primarily due to a royalty gain in the fourth quarter), offset by decreased volumes in our defense and space and commercial aftermarket businesses and an increase in incentive payments due to business and general aviation and air transport and regional oe manufacturers to partially offset their pre-production costs associated with new aircraft platforms.
   commercial original equipment sales increased by 3% driven primarily by higher air transport volumes, consistent with the oe manufacturers higher production rates, and strong demand in the business jet mid to large cabin segment, partially offset by an increase in oem incentive payments to business and general aviation customers.
   commercial aftermarket sales increased by 2% driven primarily by higher retrofits, modifications and upgrades activities and higher repair and overhaul activities for air transport and regional customers, partially offset by fewer repair and overhaul activities for business and general aviation customers.
   transportation systems sales increased by 5% primarily due to an increase in organic sales driven by continued strong growth from new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration.
aerospace segment profit increased by 6% primarily due to an increase in operational segment profit driven by commercial sales growth, as discussed above, including favorable pricing and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by lower defense and space sales, as discussed above. cost of products and services sold totaled $11.9 billion in 2013, an increase of approximately $26 million, primarily due to the factors discussed above (excluding price).

pmt sales increased by 4% due to 5% increase in organic sales partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.
   uop sales increased by 8% driven primarily by higher catalyst and gas processing volumes partially offset by lower equipment and service revenues in the first nine months. catalyst sales decreased in the fourth quarter due to the timing of shipments as well as stronger volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to 2014 which was partially offset by increased licensing revenues.
   sales in our process solutions business increased by 1% (4% organic) driven primarily by volume growth in advanced solutions software and services and field products partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange, predominately in the fourth quarter. project and service orders and backlog increased in
   advanced materials sales increased by 3% primarily driven by increased volume in fluorine products and resins and chemicals, partially offset by unfavorable pricing most significantly in fluorine products and resins and chemicals. we anticipate unfavorable pricing to continue in 2015 primarily in resins and chemicals where sales fluctuate with the market price of certain raw materials, which are correlated to the price of oil.
pmt segment profit increased by 5% due to a 6% increase in operational segment profit partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. the increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to higher sales volumes, as discussed above, and productivity, net of inflation partially offset by unfavorable advanced materials pricing, continued investment for growth and unfavorable foreign exchange. cost of products and services sold totaled $7.2 billion in 2014, an increase of $247 million which is primarily due to higher volume and continued investment for growth partially offset by productivity, net of inflation and the favorable impact of foreign exchange.
2013 compared with 2012
pmt sales increased by 6% due to 5% growth from acquisitions and 1% increase in organic growth.
   uop sales increased by 31% (9% organic) primarily driven by (i) the favorable impact of acquisitions, (ii) higher volume of petrochemical catalysts, (iii) increased revenue from gas processing and (iv) increased equipment revenue in the first half of 2013, partially offset by decreased service revenues related to scheduled project completions and lower licensing revenues.
   sales in our process solutions business were flat (increased 1% organic) principally due to decreased volume reflecting the completion of several large projects as expected offset by service and software solutions volume growth.
   advanced materials sales decreased by 3% primarily driven by (i) lower flourine products volume (due to the unfavorable impact of unseasonably cool weather on refrigerant volume and planned plant outages in the first half of 2013) and price, (ii) soft end market conditions in electronic materials and (iii)
pmt segment profit increased by 11% due to a 6% increase in operational segment profit and a 5% increase from acquisitions. the increase in operational segment profit is primarily due to higher uop sales volume and positive impact of productivity, net of inflation and investment for growth. cost of products and services sold totaled $6.9 billion in 2013, an increase of $347 million which is primarily due to acquisitions and inflation, partially offset by productivity.
repositioning charges see note 3 repositioning and other charges of notes to financial statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2014, 2013 and 2012. these repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of $100 million to $125 million in 2015 compared with 2014 principally from planned workforce reductions. cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $161 million, $160 million and $136 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and was funded through operating cash flows. in 2015, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $150 million and to be funded through operating cash flows.
liquidity and capital resources the company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. in addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. we continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends.
cash flow summary our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, are summarized as follows:
cash provided by (used for):
operating activities                               $        5,024                       $    4,335                       $    3,517

2014 compared with 2013
cash provided by operating activities increased by $689 million primarily due to (i) a $508 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (ii) reduced net payments for repositioning and other charges of $233 million (primarily due to the collection of a $130 million asbestos receivable due from one of our insurance carriers and lower asbestos related payments of $98 million), (iii) reduced cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $131 million and (iv) lower cash tax payments of approximately $129 million, partially offset by a $93 million unfavorable impact from working capital (primarily driven by higher inventory to support sales growth).
cash used for investing activities decreased by $83 million primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $1,129 million (most significantly intermec and rae systems, inc. in 2013) and an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $157 million (most significantly friction materials), partially offset by (i) a net $688 million increase in investments (primarily short-term marketable securities), (ii) an increase of approximately $371 million in settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a $147 million increase in expenditures for property, plant and equipment.
cash used for financing activities increased by $1,839 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $1,589 million, an increase in cash dividends paid of $157 million and lower net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $33 million.
2013 compared with 2012
cash provided by operating activities increased by $818 million primarily due to (i) reduced cash contributions to our pension plans of $883 million, (ii) a $447 million increase of net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (iii) a $135 million favorable impact from working capital (driven by improved accounts payable performance and inventory, partially offset by higher receivables primarily due to sales growth and timing of sales), partially offset by higher cash tax payments of approximately $352 million and a $260 million increase in net payments for repositioning and other charges (most significantly the narco trust establishment payments of $164 million).
cash used for investing activities increased by $531 million primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $695 million (most significantly intermec and rae systems inc.), partially offset by an increase of approximately $190 million in settlement receipts of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
cash used for financing activities decreased by $773 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $1,462 million, partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $651 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $142 million.
liquidity each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. in addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. at december 31, 2014, a substantial portion of the companys cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. if the amounts held outside of the u.s. were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the u.s. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting u.s. income tax liability.
we monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.
a source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. the weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 0.60% and 0.79%, respectively.
our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. as of december 31, 2014, standard and poors (s&p), fitch, and moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of a, a and a2 respectively, and short-term debt of a-1, f1 and p1 respectively. s&p, fitch and moodys have honeywells rating outlook as stable. to date, the company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity.
we also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures and acquisitions.
on december 10, 2013, the company entered into a $4 billion amended and restated five year credit agreement (credit agreement) with a syndicate of banks. commitments under the credit agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. the credit agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. there have been no borrowings under the credit agreement.
during 2014, the company repurchased $924 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. in december 2013, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of honeywell common stock, $4.1 billion remained available as of december 31, 2014 for additional share repurchases.
in addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments.
specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2015 to be as follows:
   capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $1.3 billion for capital expenditures in 2015 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement.
   share repurchasesunder the companys share repurchase program, $4.1 billion is available as of december 31, 2014 for additional share repurchases. honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. the amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.
   dividendswe increased our dividend rate by 15% to $.5175 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2014 dividend. the company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2015.
   asbestos claimswe expect our cash spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $350 million and $30 million, respectively, in 2015.
   pension contributionsin 2015, we are not required to make contributions to our u.s. pension plans. we plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $140 million ($109 million of marketable securities were contributed in january 2015) to our non-u.s. plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. the timing and amount of contributions to both our u.s. and non-u.s. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans.
   repositioning actionswe expect that cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $150 million in 2015.
   environmental remediation costswe expect to spend approximately $275 million in 2015 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs.
we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. we identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. we also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. these businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. in 2014 and 2013, we realized $160 million and $3 million, respectively, in cash proceeds from sales of non-strategic businesses.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. our available cash, committed credit lines, access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities.
contractual obligations and probable liability payments following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at december 31, 2014:

(5)   these amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of december 31, 2014. see asbestos matters in note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for additional information.
(6)   the table excludes tax effects as well as $659 million of uncertain tax positions. see note 5 income taxes of notes to financial statements for additional information.
environmental matters accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $268 million, $272 million and $234 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. in addition, in both 2014 and 2013 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $88 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations.
spending related to known environmental matters was $321 million, $304 million and $320 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $275 million in 2015. we expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. the timing of cash expenditures depends on a numbers of factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties.
see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for further discussion of our environmental matters.

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
contingent liabilitieswe are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of
managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies.
asbestos related contingencies and insurance recoverieshoneywells involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. regarding north american refractories company (narco) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with narco, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection. we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the narco trust through 2018. in light of the inherent uncertainties in making long term projections and in connection with the initial operation of a 524(g) trust, as well as the stay of all narco asbestos claims from january 2002 through the effective date of the narco trust on april 30, 2013, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating narco asbestos claims beyond 2018. regarding bendix asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. in light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years.
in connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. in assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. while the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.
see note 19 commitments and contingencies of notes to financial statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries.
defined benefit pension planswe sponsor both funded and unfunded u.s. and non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. annual pension (income) expense is comprised of a potential mark-to-market adjustment (mtm adjustment) and service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization (pension ongoing (income) expense).
the key assumptions used in developing our 2014, 2013 and 2012 net periodic pension (income) expense for our u.s. plans included the following:
assets:
the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor. net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the
various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. the mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustments. mtm charges were $249 million, $51 million and $957 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
we determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see note 20 pension and other postretirement benefits of notes to financial statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2015 as this is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and the asset mix of the plans investments.
the discount rate reflects the market rate on december 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. the discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. we will use a 4.08% discount rate in 2015, reflecting the significant decline in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end.
in addition to the potential for mtm adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. the following table highlights the sensitivity of our u.s. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. these estimates exclude any potential mtm adjustment:
change in assumption   impact on 2015         impact on pbo pension ongoing expense
0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets   increase $41 million   
0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets   decrease $41 million   
pension ongoing income for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $385 million in 2015 compared with pension ongoing income of $254 million in 2014. the increase in pension ongoing income in 2015 compared with 2014 results primarily from lower interest cost due to a decline in discount rates at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013 and an increase in the plans assets at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013 mainly due to strong asset returns in 2014. also, if required, an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mtm adjustment in 2015, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. mtm adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.
long-lived assets (including tangible and finite-lived intangible assets)the determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. the principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows:
   significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;
   annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;
   significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.
once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. the impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. the key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include expected industry growth rates, our assumptions as to volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testingin testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. these impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions.
income taxeson a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences.
sales recognition on long-term contractsin 2014, we recognized approximately 15% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion method for long-term contracts in our aerospace, acs and pmt segments. these long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenue and cost. contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. we maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

risk factors we may not be able to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.
we operate in a highly competitive industry. our revenues and earnings may be affected by changes in competitors
prices, and general economic issues. we compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies, for a finite number of customers. we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are service quality, and product availability, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service is excellent, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position.
economic conditions may adversely affect our business pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers. as consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures, we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines.
economic downturns can also adversely affect our commercial customers, including food service, hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies. for example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider.
we may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions.
acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. we cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future. we cannot assure investors that we will be able to integrate successfully the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own business. any inability on our part to integrate and manage the growth from acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions.
our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions across the united states and canada. the business of the company is affected by the seasonal nature of the companys pest and termite control services. the increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of the companys pest and termite control operations during such periods. the business of the company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods.
our inability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.
our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers. our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. the demand for skilled employees is high, and the supply is very limited. a significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force, increases in wage rates paid by us, or both. if either of these events occurred, our capacity and profitability could be diminished, and our growth potential could be impaired.
our operations could be affected by pending and ongoing litigation.
in the normal course of business, some of the companys subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits or arbitrations, which allege that plaintiffs have been damaged. the company does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual year .
our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with regulatory and environmental laws.
our business is significantly affected by environmental laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry and by changes in such laws and the level of enforcement of such laws. we are unable to predict the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how such laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings, or whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted. we believe our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations. we also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations to date. however, such environmental laws are changed frequently. we are unable to predict whether environmental laws will, in the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition. penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include cancellation of licenses, fines, and other corrective actions, which would negatively affect our future financial results.
the companys management has a substantial ownership interest; public stockholders may have no effective voice in the companys management the company has elected the controlled company exemption under section 303a of the new york stock exchange
(nyse) listed company manual. the company is a controlled company because a group that includes the companys chairman of the board, r. randall rollins and his brother, gary w. rollins, who is the vice chairman and chief executive officer, and a director of the company and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the companys voting power. as a controlled company, the company need not comply with certain nyse rules.
rollins, inc.s executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, approximately 57 percent of the companys outstanding shares of common stock. as a result, these persons will effectively control the operations of the company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. this concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the company at a premium.
item 1.b.  unresolved staff comments none item 2.  properties.
the companys administrative headquarters are owned by the company, and are located at 2170 piedmont road, n.e., atlanta, georgia 30324. the company owns or leases over 500 branch offices and operating facilities used in its business as well as the rollins training center located in atlanta, georgia, the rollins customer service center located in covington, georgia, and the pacific division administration and training center in riverside, california. none of the branch offices, individually considered, represents a materially important physical property of the company. the facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the company.
item 3.  legal proceedings.
in the normal course of business, certain of the companys subsidiaries are defendants in a number of lawsuits, claims or arbitrations which allege that the subsidiaries services caused damage. in addition, the company defends employment related cases and claims from time to time. we are involved in certain environmental matters primarily arising in the normal course of business. we are actively contesting each of these matters.

on december 2, 2014, plaintiff jose luis garnica, on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated customers, sued rollins, inc., its subsidiary hometeam pest defense, and alleged that hometeams exclusive use of its tubes in the walls system violates the federal sherman antitrust act. the plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the alleged misconduct violates the sherman act; a permanent injunction against continuing violations; and monetary damages. the lawsuit is pending in the united states district court, northern district of california. the company cannot currently estimate the loss, if any, because the lawsuit is at an early stage and involves unresolved issues of law and fact. the company intends to defend this matter vigorously.
management does not believe that any pending claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters, however unlikely, could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an individual quarter or year.

cash provided by operating activities the companys operations generated cash of $194.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily from net income of $137.7 million, compared with cash provided by operating activities of $162.7 million in 2013 and $141.9
million in 2012. the company believes its current cash and cash equivalents balances, future cash flows expected to be generated from operating activities and available borrowings under its $175.0 million credit facility will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations, and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future.
the company made contributions totaling $5.3 million to the rollins, inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
defined benefit retirement plans (the plans) during the year ended december 31, 2014 and $5.0 million and $5.2
the company is considering making contributions to its plans of approximately $3.3 million during fiscal 2015. in the opinion of management, additional plan contributions will not have a material effect on the companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
cash used in investing activities the company used $89.5 million on investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $30.8
million and $42.7 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively, and of that, invested approximately $28.7 million in capital expenditures during 2014 compared to $18.6 million and $19.0 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively.
capital expenditures for the year consisted primarily of property purchases, equipment replacements and technology related projects. the company expects to invest between $20.0 million and $25.0 million in 2015 in capital expenditures. during 2014, the companys subsidiaries acquired several small companies totaling $63.3 million compared to $12.6 million in acquisitions during 2013 and $25.0 million in 2012. the expenditures for the companys acquisitions were funded with cash on hand and stock in one instance. the company continues to seek new acquisitions.
cash provided by financing activities the company used cash of $106.5 million on financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to $75.7 million and $81.0 million during 2013 and 2012, respectively. a total of $75.8 million was paid in cash dividends ($0.52
the company used $29.3 million to repurchase on the open market 1.0 million shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $29.19 per share during 2014 compared to $8.4 million to purchase 0.3 million shares at an average price of $24.56 in 2013 and $16.4 million to purchase 0.8 million shares at a weighted average price of
$20.93 in 2012. there remain 4.0 million shares authorized to be repurchased under prior board approval. in addition to the shares purchased on the open market, the company repurchased $6.2 million, $5.3 million and $3.5
million of common stock for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, from employees for the payment of taxes on vesting restricted shares.
the company's $108.4 million of total cash at december 31, 2014, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. approximately $35.0 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $73.3 million is primarily held in federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") insured non-interest-bearing accounts at various domestic banks which at times may exceed federally insured amounts.
the companys international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. repatriation of cash from the companys foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the companys current business plan.
the company maintains a large cash position in the united states while having no third-party debt to service.
rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources, without regard to its foreign deposits, that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business.
on october 31, 2012, the company entered into a revolving credit agreement with suntrust bank and bank of america, n.a. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. the credit agreement was amended on october 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to october 31, 2018 and add three optional one year extensions. as of december 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility. the company maintains approximately $35.5 million in letters of credit. these letters of credit are required by the companys fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the companys self-insured status, to secure various workers
compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.
the revolving credit agreement is guaranteed by certain of rollins' domestic-subsidiaries. the maturity date of the credit agreement is october 31, 2018, subject to up to three optional extensions of the credit agreement for one year each. revolving loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the company's election:
●  to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50% per annum, and (iii) the adjusted libor rate
(which equals libor as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the u.s.
federal reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month, plus 1.0% per annum.
with respect to any eurodollar borrowings, the adjusted libor rate plus an additional amount, which varies between .75% and 1.00%, based upon rollins then-current debt-to-ebitda ratio. as of december 31, 2014, the additional rate allocated
the revolving credit agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the companys ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. further, the revolving credit agreement contains financial covenants restricting the companys ability to permit the ratio of the companys consolidated debt to ebitda to exceed certain limits.
the company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at december 31, 2014 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2015.

critical accounting policies the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require managements most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:
accrual for termite contracts- the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the companys business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the companys consolidated statements of financial position.
accrued insurance- the company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers compensation and vehicle liability. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-
(although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semi-
annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with managements knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. managements judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside managements knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, and pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing. the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited-duty basis.
revenue recognition- the companys revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. for certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. in general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. for pest control customers, the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. at the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. this portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits.
the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions.
baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.
revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. for outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term.
as the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. the company accrues for noticed claims. the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.
contingency accruals- the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification
("asc") topic 450 "contingencies,"management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations. contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
defined benefit pension plans- in 2005, the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins, inc.
defined benefit plan, although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june
2005. the company terminated the waltham services, llc salaried pension plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum distribution in december 2012. the company also includes the waltham services, llc hourly employee pension plan to the companys financial statements. the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 compensation- retirement benefits, and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. with the assistance of the actuary, the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.
the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense. the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from the prior year.
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company utilizes a yield curve approach. the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the companys expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. the discount rate was 4.15% as of december 31, 2014 compared to 5.20% in 2013 and 4.17% in 2012. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation.
as set forth in note 13 to the company's financial statements, included among the asset categories for the plan's investments are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-
observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. in accordance with accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2009-12 " investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent),"these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.
as of december 31, 2014, the defined benefit plans were under-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders equity by $41.7 million before tax and $25.6 million after tax.
new accounting standards recently adopted accounting standards in february 2013, the financial accounting standard board (fasb) issued accounting standard update (asu) no.
2013-02, reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (asu 2013-02) to comprehensive income. the guidance requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
in february 2013, the fasb issued asu no. 2013-04, liabilities (topic 405): obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force). this guidance requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date. this stipulates that (1) it will include the amount the entity agreed to pay for the arrangement between them and the other entities that are also obligated to the liability and (2) any additional amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of the other entities. the objective of this update is to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
in july 2013, the fasb issued asu no 2013-11, income taxes (topic 740): presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. topic 740, income taxes, does not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. there is diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in those instances. some entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a liability unless the unrecognized tax benefit is directly associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results in, or that resulted in, the recognition of a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward for that year and the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward has not been utilized. other entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward in certain circumstances. the objective of the amendments in this update is to eliminate that diversity in practice. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year.
adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2015 or later in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, presentation of financial statements (topic 205 and 360): reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of components of an entity. asu 2014-08 amends the definition for what types of asset disposals are to be considered discontinued operations, and amends the required disclosures for discontinued operations and assets held for sale. asu 2014-08 also enhances the convergence of the fasb's and the international accounting standard board's reporting requirements for discontinued operations. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): "revenue from contracts with customers" (asu 2014-09) which requires companies to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control rather than when companies have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service. asu 2014-09
is effective retrospectively for the annual or interim reporting periods beginning on or after december 15, 2016. the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu 2014-09 on its financial statements. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.
in january 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-01, income statement-extraordinary and unusual items (topic
225): income statement-extraordinary and unusual items (asu 2015-01) eliminate the gaap concept of extraordinary items. the new guidance eliminates the separate presentation of extraordinary items, net of tax and the related earnings per share, but does not affect the requirement to disclose material items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.
forward-looking statements this annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. such forward-looking statements include statements regarding managements belief that environmental remediation costs estimated to be incurred are not material to the companys financial condition or operating results; the outcome of litigation, as discussed in the legal proceedings section and elsewhere, and the companys belief that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity; the companys expectation to continue its payment of cash dividends;
managements belief that it has identified many opportunities to improve its business in the future; the adequacy of the companys resources and borrowings to fund operations and obligations; managements belief that any additional pension plan contributions will not have a material effect on the companys financial position, results of operation or liquidity; the companys projected 2015 capital expenditures; the plans to expand orkins franchise program and to grow in foreign markets through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings and through acquisitions; the companys expectation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving credit agreement throughout 2015; the impact and amount of the companys contractual obligations; managements expectations regarding termite claims and factors that impact future costs from those claims; the expected cost of termite renewals; the expected collectability of accounts receivable; expected tax consequences; the impact of recent accounting pronouncements; and interest rate risks and foreign exchange currency risk on the companys financial position, results of operations and liquidity. the actual results of the company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks, timing and uncertainties including, without limitation, the possibility of an adverse ruling against the company in pending litigation;
general economic conditions; market risk; changes in industry practices or technologies; the degree of success of the companys termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment methods; the companys ability to identify potential acquisitions; climate and weather trends; competitive factors and pricing practices; potential increases in labor costs; and changes in various government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. all of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control, and in many cases the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.
item 7a.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
market risk the company maintains an investment portfolio subject to short-term interest rate risk exposure. the company is also subject to interest rate risk exposure through borrowings on its $175 million credit facility. currently, the company has no outstanding borrowings. however, the company does maintain approximately $35.5 million in letters of credit. the company is also exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. the company believes that this foreign exchange rate risk will not have a material effect upon the companys results of operations or financial position going forward.
managements report on internal controls over financial reporting to the stockholders of rollins, inc.:
the management of rollins, inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. rollins, inc. maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the internal control system is augmented by written policies and procedures, an internal audit program and the selection and training of qualified personnel. this system includes policies that require adherence to ethical business standards and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, as of december 31, 2014 based on criteria established in the 2013
internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, managements assessment is that rollins, inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014.
the independent registered public accounting firm, grant thornton llp has audited the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31, 2014, and has also issued their report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting, included in this report on page 24.

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting board of directors and stockholders'
we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of rollins, inc. (a delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the "company") as of december
31, 2014, based on criteria established in the, 2013 internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal controls over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014, based on criteria established in the 2013 internal control-integrated framework issued by coso.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the year ended december 31, 2014, and our report dated february 25, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of rollins, inc. and subsidiaries as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

notes to consolidated financial statements years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, rollins, inc. and subsidiaries
1.  summary of significant accounting policies business description-rollins, inc. (the company) was originally incorporated in 1948 under the laws of the state of delaware as rollins broadcasting, inc.
the company is an international service company with headquarters located in atlanta, georgia, providing pest and termite control services through its wholly-owned subsidiaries to both residential and commercial customers in north america with international franchises in central america, the caribbean, the middle east, asia, the mediterranean, europe, africa, and mexico. services are performed through a contract that specifies service frequency and the pricing arrangement with the customer.
orkin, llc. (orkin), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company founded in 1901, is the worlds largest pest and termite control company. it provides customized services from over 400 locations. orkin serves customers, either directly, or franchise operations, in the united states, canada, central america, the caribbean, the middle east, asia, the mediterranean, europe, africa, and mexico providing essential pest control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to homes and businesses, including hotels, food service establishments, food manufacturers, retailers and transportation companies. orkin operates under the orkin ®, and orkin canada
®trademarks and the acurid smservice mark. the orkin ®brand name makes orkin the most recognized pest and termite company throughout the united states. the orkin canada brand name provides similar brand recognition throughout canada.
orkin canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary of orkin founded in 1952, was acquired by orkin in 1999. orkin canada is canadas largest pest control provider and a leader in the development of fast, effective and environmentally responsible pest control solutions.
western pest services (western), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company founded in 1928, was acquired by rollins, inc. in 2004. western is primarily a commercial pest control service company and its business complements most of the services orkin offers focusing on the northeastern united states.
the industrial fumigant company (ifc), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company founded in 1937, was acquired by rollins, inc. in 2005. ifc is a leading provider of pest management and sanitation services and products to the food and commodity industries.
hometeam pest defense (hometeam), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company established in 1996, was acquired by rollins, inc. in april 2008. at the time of the acquisition, hometeam, with its unique taexx® tubes in the wall pest control system, was recognized as a premier pest control business and ranked as the 4th largest company in the industry. hometeam services home builders nationally.
rollins australia (rollins australia), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, acquired allpest wa (allpest), in february 2014. allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in perth, australia. allpest provides traditional residential, commercial and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related to australias biosecurity program and provides specialized services to australias mining and oil and gas sectors.
the company has only one reportable segment, its pest and termite control business. revenue, operating profit and identifiable assets for this segment, includes the united states, canada, central america, the caribbean, the middle east, asia, the mediterranean, europe, africa, and mexico. the companys results of operations and its financial condition are not reliant upon any single customer, few customers or foreign operations.
principles of consolidation- the companys consolidated financial statements include the accounts of rollins, inc.
and our wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. (gaap). the company does not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which it has an ownership interest of 50% or less. the company is not the primary beneficiary of, nor does it have a controlling financial interest in, any variable interest entity. accordingly, the company has not consolidated any variable interest entity. the company reclassified certain prior period amounts, none of which were material, to conform to the current period presentation. all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
subsequent events-the company evaluates its financial statements through the date the financial statements are issued. on february 2, 2015 we announced that harry j. cynkus, cfo of rollins, inc. would retire in 2015. eddie northen is expected to succeed harry cynkus as cfo effective may 1, 2015.
three-for-two stock split-the board of directors at its quarterly meeting on january 27, 2015, authorized a three-
for-two stock split by the issuance on march 10, 2015 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at february 10, 2015. unless otherwise stated all share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented prior to this stock split.
estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements-the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying notes and financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates.
revenue recognition- the companys revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. for certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. in general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. for pest control customers, the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. at the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. this portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits.
the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions.
baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.
revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. for outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. as the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. the company accrues for noticed claims. the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.
the companys foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of revenues for each of the years ended december
interest income on installment receivables is accrued monthly based on actual loan balances and stated interest rates. recognition of initial franchise fee revenues occurs when all material services or conditions relating to a new agreement have been substantially performed or satisfied by the company, initial franchise fees are treated as unearned revenue in the statement of financial position until such time. royalties from orkin franchises are accrued and recognized as revenues as earned on a monthly basis. gains on sales of pest control customer accounts to franchises are recognized at the time of sale and when collection is reasonably assured.
allowance for doubtful accounts- the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectability of accounts receivable. management uses historical collection results as well as accounts receivable aging in order to determine the expected collectability of accounts receivable. substantially all of the companys receivables are due from pest control and termite services in the united states and selected international locations. the companys allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. the companys established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. accounts are written-off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery. therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. there were no large recoveries in 2014, 2013, and 2012. we record specific provisions when we become aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position. if circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the realizability of receivables would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.
advertising-advertising costs are charged to sales, general and administrative expense during the year in which they are incurred.
cash and cash equivalents- the company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. short-term investments, included in cash and cash equivalents, are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value.
the company's $108.4 million of total cash at december 31, 2014, is primarily cash held at various banking institutions. approximately $35.0 million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining $73.3 million is primarily held in federal deposit insurance corporation ("fdic") insured non-interest-
the companys international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisitions of unrelated companies. repatriation of cash from the companys foreign subsidiaries is not a part of the companys current business plan.
the company maintains a large cash position in the united states while having little third-party debt to service.
rollins maintains adequate liquidity and capital resources without regard to its foreign deposits that are directed to finance domestic operations and obligations and to fund expansion of its domestic business for the foreseeable future.
held in foreign bank accounts marketable securities- from time to time, the company maintains investments held by several large, well-capitalized financial institutions. the companys investment policy does not allow investment in any securities rated less than
investment grade by national rating services.
management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. debt securities are classified as available-for-sale because the company does not have the intent to hold the securities to maturity. available-for-sale securities are stated at their fair values, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included as a component of interest income.
the company had no marketable securities other than those held in the defined pension benefit plan and the nonqualified deferred compensation plan at december 31, 2014 and 2013. see note 13 for further details.
materials and supplies-materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.
income taxes-the company provides for income taxes based on the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc")topic 740
"income taxes", which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. the company provides an allowance for deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized.
the company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold. the company's policy is to record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
equipment and property-equipment and property are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases and are provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. annual provisions for depreciation are computed using the following asset lives: buildings, ten to forty years; and furniture, fixtures, and operating equipment, two to ten years. expenditures for additions, major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. the cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposal with the resulting gain or loss credited or charged to income. the annual provisions for depreciation, below, have been reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the line item entitled depreciation and amortization.
goodwill and other intangible assets-in accordance with the fasb asc topic 350, intangibles - goodwill and other, the company classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. the company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill. goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. such conditions may include an economic downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations. the company performs impairment tests of goodwill at the company level.
such impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the appropriate reporting unit (the company)
with its carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, then the company will compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. impairment losses are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. the company performs impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its carrying value. the company recognizes an impairment charge if the assets carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. the company completed its most recent annual impairment analyses as of september 30, 2014. based upon the results of these analyses, the company has concluded that no impairment of its goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives was indicated.
impairment of long-lived assets-in accordance with the fasb asc topic 360, property, plant and equipment, the companys long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. we periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including customer contracts and assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.
insurance-the company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers
compensation and vehicle liability. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with managements knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. managements judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside managements knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events.
accrual for termite contracts-the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future costs include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the companys business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. an accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the companys consolidated statements of financial position.
contingency accruals-the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the fasb asc topic 450 contingencies,management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liability may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations.
contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the companys consolidated statements of financial position.
three-for-two stock split-the board of directors at its quarterly meeting on january 27, 2015, authorized a three-
for-two stock split by the issuance on march 10, 2015 of one additional common share for each two common shares held of record at february 10, 2015. unless otherwise stated all share and per share data appearing in the consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented prior to this stock split.
earnings per share-the fasb asc topic 260-10 earnings per share- overall,requires a basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share presentation. further, all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are considered participating securities and an entity is required to include participating securities in its calculation of basic earnings per share.
the company has periodically issued share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and therefore are considered participating securities. see note 14 for further information on restricted stock granted to employees.
the basic and diluted calculations differ as a result of the dilutive effect of stock options included in diluted earnings per share, but excluded from basic earnings per share. basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the respective periods.
a reconciliation of weighted average shares outstanding along with the earnings per share attributable to restricted shares of common stock (participating securities) is as follows (in thousands except per share data).

translation of foreign currencies-assets and liabilities reported in functional currencies other than u.s. dollars are translated into u.s. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted-average exchange rates for the year. the resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, denominated in foreign currency are included in the earnings of the current period.
stock-based compensation- the company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with the fasb asc topic 718  compensation - stock compensation. stock options and time lapse restricted shares (tlrss) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the companys employee stock incentive plan. the companys stock options generally vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date.
tlrss provide for the issuance of a share of the companys common stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. outstanding tlrss vest in 20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant. during these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. the agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed. the fair value of these awards is recognized as compensation expense, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over six years.
the company has not granted stock options since 2003.

31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. transactions with domestic franchises involve sales of customer contracts to establish new franchises, initial franchise fees and royalties. the customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically sold for a combination of cash and notes due over periods ranging up to five years. notes receivable from franchises were $4.2 million at december 31, 2014 and $4.1 million at december 31, 2013. these amounts are included as financing receivables in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position.
the company recognizes gains from the sale of customer contracts at the time they are sold to franchises and collection on the notes is reasonably assured. the company recognized net gains of $0.1 million, $0.2 million, and
$0.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively for the sale of customer contracts. these amounts are included as revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
all domestic franchises have a guaranteed repurchase clause that the franchise may be repurchased by orkin at a later date once it has been established; therefore, initial domestic franchise fees are deferred in accordance with the fasb asc topic 952-605 franchisor revenue recognition, for the duration of the initial contract period and are included as unearned revenue in the consolidated statements of financial position. deferred franchise fees were
royalties from franchises are accrued and recognized in accordance with the fasb asc topic 952-605 franchisor revenue recognition, as revenues are earned on a monthly basis. revenue from franchises was $4.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $3.9 million and $3.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, orkin had 37, 26, and 22 international franchises, respectively. orkins international franchise program began with its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to central america, south america, the caribbean, the middle east, asia, the mediterranean, europe, africa and mexico.
the companys maximum exposure to loss (notes receivable from franchises less deferred franchise fees) relating to the franchises was $1.2 million, $1.2 million, and $2.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and
new accounting standards recently adopted accounting standards in february 2013, the financial accounting standard board (fasb) issued accounting standard update (asu) no.
2013-02, reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (asu 2013-02) to comprehensive income. the guidance requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
in february 2013, the fasb issued asu no. 2013-04, liabilities (topic 405): obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force). this guidance requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date. this stipulates that (1) it will include the amount the entity agreed to pay for the arrangement between them and the other entities that are also obligated to the liability and (2) any additional amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of the other entities. the objective of this update is to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
in july 2013,the fasb issued asu no 2013-11, income taxes (topic 740): presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. topic 740, income taxes, does not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. there is diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in those instances. some entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a liability unless the unrecognized tax benefit is directly associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results in, or that resulted in, the recognition of a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward for that year and the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward has not been utilized. other entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward in certain circumstances. the objective of the amendments in this update is to eliminate that diversity in practice.the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year.
adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2015 or later in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, presentation of financial statements (topic 205 and 360): reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of components of an entity. asu 2014-08 amends the definition for what types of asset disposals are to be considered discontinued operations, and amends the required disclosures for discontinued operations and assets held for sale. asu 2014-08 also enhances the convergence of the fasb's and the international accounting standard board's reporting requirements for discontinued operations. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): "revenue from contracts with customers" (asu 2014-09) which requires companies to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control rather than when companies have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service. asu 2014-09
is effective retrospectively for the annual or interim reporting periods beginning on or after december 15, 2016. the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu 2014-09 on its financial statements. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.
in january 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-01, income statement-extraordinary and unusual items (topic
225): income statement-extraordinary and unusual items (asu 2015-01) eliminate the gaap concept of extraordinary items. the new guidance eliminates the separate presentation of extraordinary items, net of tax and the related earnings per share, but does not affect the requirement to disclose material items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.
2.  acquisitions the company has made several acquisitions that are not material individually or in total to the companys consolidated financial statements during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012.
rollins australia (rollins australia), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, acquired allpest wa (allpest), in february 2014. allpest was established in 1959 and is headquartered in perth, australia. allpest provides traditional commercial, residential, and termite service as well as consulting services on border protection related to australias biosecurity program and provides specialized services to australias mining and oil and gas sectors.
acquisition of wilco enterprises, inc. (sole holder of permatreat exterminating company, inc. d/b/a permatreat pest control, inc.) (permatreat) - the company completed the acquisition of permatreat effective august 1, 2014.
permatreat is a leading pest control company located in central and northern virginia and was founded in 1967. the company issued 582,233 shares of its $1 par value common stock valued at $28.19 per share to joseph r. wilson and jack broome. a valuation of the acquired assets is currently being performed and an estimate has been recorded in the companys financial statements. the effect of any adjustments to these estimates for permatreat is not expected to have a material effect on the companys financial statements as the net total adjustment will affect a combination of goodwill, customer contracts, and other intangible assets at the end of the measurement period.
total cash purchase price for the companys acquisitions in 2014 was $63.3 million, and the company issued common stock as purchase price in acquisition having a total value of $16.4 million.
the fair values of major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed along with the contingent consideration liability recorded at the date of acquisition is included in the reconciliation of the total consideration as follows (in thousands):
customer                           28,237
intangible assets current                            (6,733  )
liabilities other                              (2,900  )
assets and liabilities, net total                              81,318
consideration liability total                          $   63,335
3.  debt on october 31, 2012, the company entered into a revolving credit agreement with suntrust bank and bank of america, n.a. for an unsecured line of credit of up to $175.0 million, which includes a $75.0 million letter of credit subfacility, and a $25.0 million swingline subfacility. the credit agreement was amended on october 30, 2014 to extend the maturity date to october 31, 2018 and add three optional one year extensions.as of december 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility. the company maintains approximately $35.5 million in letters of credit. these letters of credit are required by the companys fronting insurance companies and/or certain states, due to the companys self-insured status, to secure various workers
compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage. the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets, funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims.
the revolving credit agreement is guaranteed by certain of rollins' domestic-subsidiaries. the maturity date of the credit agreement is october 31, 2018, subject to up to three optional extensions of the credit agreement for one year each. revolving loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates, at the company's election:
the base rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the administrative agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the federal
●  funds rate, plus 0.50% per annum, and (iii) the adjusted libor rate (which equals libor as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the u.s. federal reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month, plus 1.0% per annum.
with respect to any eurodollar borrowings, the adjusted libor rate plus an additional amount, which varies between .75% and 1.00%, based upon rollins then-current debt-to-ebitda
●  ratio. as of december 31, 2014, the additional rate allocated was .75%.
the revolving credit agreement contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the companys ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens, or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity. further, the revolving credit agreement contains financial covenants restricting the companys ability to permit the ratio of the companys consolidated debt to ebitda to exceed certain limits.
the company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at december 31, 2014 and expects to maintain compliance throughout 2015.
4.  trade receivables the allowance for doubtful accounts is principally calculated based on the application of estimated loss percentages to delinquency aging totals, based on contractual terms, for the various categories of receivables. bad debt write-offs occur according to company policies that are specific to pest control, commercial and termite accounts.
for doubtful accounts net                              $   77,854       $  72,849
5.  financing receivables rollins manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risks. the companys credit risk is generally low with a large number of entities comprising rollins customer base and dispersion across many different geographical regions. the credit quality of a potential obligor is evaluated at the loan origination based on an assessment of the individuals beacon/credit bureau score. rollins requires potential obligor to have good credit worthiness with low risk before entering into a contract. depending upon the individuals credit score the company may accept with 100% financing or require a significant down payment or turndown the contract. delinquencies of accounts are monitored each month. financing receivables include installment receivable amounts which are due subsequent to one year from the balance sheet dates.
for doubtful accounts net                                  $  24,021       $  23,828
financing receivables total financing receivables, net were $24.0 million and $23.8 million at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. financing receivables are charged-off when deemed uncollectable or when 180 days have elapsed since the date of the last full contractual payment. the companys charge-off policy has been consistently applied and no significant changes have been made to the policy during the periods reported. management considers the charge-off policy when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for doubtful accounts. gross charge-offs as a percentage of average financing receivables were 3.1% and 2.7% for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, respectively. due to the low percentage of charge-off receivables and the high credit worthiness of the potential obligor, the entire rollins, inc. financing receivables portfolio has a low credit risk.
the company offers 90 days same-as-cash financing to some customers based on their credit worthiness. interest is not recognized until the 91st day at which time it is recognized retrospectively back to the first day if the contract has not been paid in full. in certain circumstances, such as when delinquency is deemed to be of an administrative nature, accounts may still accrue interest when they reach 180 days past due. as of december 31,
the carrying amount of notes receivable approximates fair value as the interest rates approximate market rates for these types of contracts. long-term installment receivables, net were $11.8 million and $11.6 million at december
rollins establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to insure financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability. the allowance balance is comprised of a general reserve, which is determined based on a percentage of the financing receivables balance, and a specific reserve, which is established for certain accounts with identified exposures, such as customer default, bankruptcy or other events, that make it unlikely that rollins will recover its investment. the general reserve percentages are based on several factors, which include consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio and information derived from competitive benchmarking.
the allowance for doubtful accounts related to financing receivables was as follows:
beginning of period additions                   748            626
buildings                 $    48,440       $    46,574
equipment furniture                      14,303            13,477
equipment and systems
equipment and property included in equipment and property, net at december 31, 2014 and 2013, are fixed assets held in foreign countries of $3.8 million, and $1.9 million, respectively.
7.  fair value measurement the companys financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and notes receivables, accounts payable, and other short-term liabilities. the carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values. the company has financial instruments related to its defined benefit pension plan and deferred compensation plan detailed in note 13.
the fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value.
level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. level 2
refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable inputs.
the following table presents our nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of december 31, 2014.
the following table presents our nonqualified deferred compensation plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of december 31, 2013.
cash and cash equivalents, which are used to pay benefits and deferred compensation plan administrative expenses, are held in money market funds.
at december 31, 2014 the deferred compensation plan had 70 life insurance policies with a net face value of $42.4
million. the cash surrender value of these life insurance policies had a net realizable value of $12.7 million and
$11.5 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the total deferred compensation plan assets, recorded in other assets on the companys consolidated statements of financial position, were $13.7 million at december 31,
8.  goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.
2013. goodwill increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 due primarily to acquisitions and currency conversion of foreign goodwill. the carrying amount of goodwill in foreign countries was $42.7 million as of december 31, 2014 and $9.2 million as of december
31, 2013. the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended december 30, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:
acquired and finalization of allocation of purchase price on previous acquisitions goodwill                                                                                  (4,761  )
9.  customer contracts and other intangible assets customer contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreements, as straight-line best approximates the ratio that current revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated revenues, based on the estimated lives of the assets. in accordance with the fasb asc topic 350 intangibles - goodwill and other,the expected lives of customer contracts were reviewed, and it was determined that customer contracts should be amortized over a life of 7 to 20 years dependent upon customer type. the carrying amount and accumulated amortization for customer contracts were as follows:
customer              $   214,125       $   226,717
amortization customer              $   104,657       $   101,457
contracts, net the carrying amount of customer contracts in foreign countries was $16.8 million as of december 31, 2014 and $6.3
other intangible assets include non-compete agreements, patents and finite lived and indefinite lived trade names.
non-compete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 20 years and patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years. the carrying amount and accumulated amortization for other intangible assets were as follows:
intangible assets less:  accumulated           (12,512  )       (9,240  )
intangible assets, net the carrying amount of other intangible assets in foreign countries was $4.1 million as of december 31, 2014 and
and 2013, respectively. also included in the table above are non-amortizable, indefinite lived intangible assets of
the carrying amount of customer contracts and other intangible assets, net were as follows:
customer                                      $  104,657    $  101,457
intangible assets, net customer                                      $  133,472    $  128,569
contracts and other intangible assets, net total amortization expense was approximately $26.9 million in 2014, $25.2 million in 2013 and $23.4 million in
estimated amortization expense for the existing carrying amount of customer contracts and other intangible assets for each of the five succeeding fiscal years are as follows:
10.  income taxes the companys income tax provision consisted of the following:
for the years ended december 31,         2014         2013            2012
foreign                             4,391        3,883           3,648
foreign                               158           94             (28  )
income tax provision the primary factors causing income tax expense to be different than the federal statutory rate for 2014, 2013, and
for the years ended december 31,                        2014            2013            2012
income tax expense (net of federal benefit)
foreign                                           (1,760  )       (2,661  )       (2,560  )
tax benefit other                                               (669  )       (2,624  )          210
income tax provision other includes the release of deferred tax liabilities, tax credits, valuation allowance, and other immaterial adjustments.
the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.3% on income before income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2014. the effective rate differs from the annual federal statutory rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes.
for 2013 and 2012 the effective tax rate was 35.6% and 37.0%, respectively. the effective income tax rate differs from the annual federal statutory tax rate primarily because of state and foreign income taxes and the release of certain deferred tax liabilities.
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes. significant components of the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities at december 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follow:
deferred tax assets:
termite                                     $    1,887       $    2,738
and benefits state                                           10,454            9,637
and foreign operating loss carryforwards bad                                              4,520            4,032
deferred tax assets deferred tax liabilities:
and amortization foreign                                              -           (1,792  )
deferred tax liabilities net                                         $   50,645       $   44,062
deferred tax assets analysis of the valuation allowance:
allowance at end of year as of december 31, 2014, the company has net operating loss carryforwards for foreign and state income tax purposes of approximately $195.5 million, which will be available to offset future taxable income. if not used, these carryforwards will expire between 2015 and 2028. management believes that it is unlikely to be able to utilize approximately $15.5 million of foreign net operating losses before they expire and has included a valuation allowance for the effect of these unrealizable operating loss carryforwards. the valuation allowance increased by
$1.2 million due to the foreign net operating losses.
earnings from continuing operations before income tax includes foreign income of $16.2 million, $17.0 million, and
$15.6 million in 2014, 2013, and 2013, respectively. the companys international business is expanding and we intend to continue to grow the business in foreign markets in the future through reinvestment of foreign deposits and future earnings as well as acquisition of unrelated companies. repatriation of cash from the companys foreign subsidiaries is not part of the companys current business plan.
there were no unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2014. a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
at beginning of year additions                              -             387
for tax positions of prior years settlements                            -          (1,968  )
at end of year the company and its subsidiaries are subject to u.s. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. in addition, the company has subsidiaries in various state and international jurisdictions that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2007 through 2013. with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to u.s. federal, state and local, or non-u.s., income tax examinations for years prior to 2010.
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase in the next 12 months.
11.  accrual for termite contracts in accordance with the fasb asc topic 450 contingencies,the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation.
a reconciliation of changes in the accrual for termite contracts is as follows:
for the years ended december 31,         2014            2013
year provision settlements,                       (3,486  )       (3,353  )
claims, and expenditures ending                          $   4,875       $   7,075
balance the accrual for termite contracts is included in other current liabilities, $1.9 million and $2.5 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively and long-term accrued liabilities, $3.0 million and $4.6 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively on the companys consolidated statements of financial position.
12.  commitments and contingencies the company leases buildings, vehicles and equipment under operating leases, some of which contain escalation clauses. the companys operating leases expires at various dates through 2028:
for the years ended december 31,         2014         2013         2012

in 2005, the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins, inc. retirement income plan, although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005. in 2012 and again in 2014, the plan was amended to allow certain vested participants the ability to elect for a limited time the commencement of their benefit in the form of a single-sum payment, not to exceed $22,000 in 2014 or $13,500 in 2012, or an annuity starting date of december
1, 2014 for the 2014 amendment, or an annuity starting date of december 1, 2012 for the 2012 amendment. in total

the company also includes the waltham services, llc hourly employee pension plan in the companys financial statements. the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715
compensation- retirement benefits, and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. with the assistance of the actuary, the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.
in june 2005, the company froze the rollins, inc. defined benefit pension plan. the company currently uses december
31 as the measurement date for its defined benefit post-retirement plans. the funded status of the plans and the net amount recognized in the statement of financial position are summarized as follows as of:

assets/(liabilities)
actuarial loss the accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans were $221.7 million and $185.9 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation are materially the same for the plans. pre-tax increases in the pension liability which were (charged, net of tax)
credited to other comprehensive income/(loss) were $(41.7) million, $45.7 million, and $(15.4) million in 2014,
the following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the accumulated benefit obligation and net benefit cost:
accumulated benefit obligation discount                    4.15  %    5.20  %    4.17  %
rate rate                         n/a        n/a        n/a of compensation increase net benefit cost discount                    5.20  %    4.17  %    5.01  %
return on plan assets rate                         n/a        n/a        n/a of compensation increase the return on plan assets reflects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in the plan. the expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in the expected returns on the plan investments.
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012 the company utilized a yield curve analysis.
the components of net periodic benefit cost are summarized as follows:
return on plan assets amortization                    2,439            3,910            3,606

comprehensive income the company expects to amortize a net loss of $3.7 million in 2015. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the plans assets were comprised of listed common stocks and u.s. government and corporate securities, real estate and other.
included in the assets of the plan were shares of rollins, inc. common stock with a market value of $37.3 million and $37.1 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
the plans weighted average asset allocation at december 31, 2014 and 2013 by asset category, along with the target allocation for 2014, are as follows:

for each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical - maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. the investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. the plans utilize a number of investment approaches, including individual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation. the company and management are considering making contributions to the pension plans of approximately
some of our assets, primarily our private equityandreal estate, do not have readily determinable market values given the specific investment structures involved and the nature of the underlying investments. for the december
31, 2014 plan asset reporting, publicly traded asset pricing was used where possible. for assets without readily determinable values, estimates were derived from investment manager statements combined withdiscussions focusing on underlying fundamentals and significant events.additionally, these investments are categorized as level 3
investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. in accordance with asu no. 2011-12 investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share
(or its equivalent), these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds financial statements for reasonableness .
fair value measurements the companys overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 70 percent of investments for long-
term growth and 30 percent for near-term benefit payments, with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and small-cap companiesdomiciled domestically andinternationally. fixed-income securities include corporate bonds, mortgage-
backed securities,sovereign bonds ,and u.s. treasuries. other types of investments include real estatefunds and private equity funds that follow several different investment strategies. for each of the asset categories in the pension plan, the investment strategy is identical - maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits. the investment policy establishes a target allocation for each asset class which is rebalanced as required. the plans utilize a number of investment approaches, includingbut not limited toindividual market securities, equity and fixed income funds in which the underlying securities are marketable, and debt funds to achieve this target allocation.

the estimated future benefit payments over the next ten years are as follows:
defined contribution 401(k) savings plan the company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan that is available to a majority of the company's full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following completion of three months of service. the plan is available to non full-time employees the first day of the calendar quarter following one year of service upon completion of 1,000 hours in that year. the plan provides for a matching contribution of fifty cents ($.50) for each one dollar ($1.00) of a participant's contributions to the plan that do not exceed 6 percent of his or her eligible compensation (which includes commissions, overtime and bonuses). the charge to expense for the company match was approximately $8.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $8.2 million and $7.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. at december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 approximately, 29.3%,
34.9%, and 32.5%, respectively of the plan assets consisted of rollins, inc. common stock. total administrative fees paid by the company for the plan were approximately $51 thousand in 2014, $54 thousand in 2013 and $53
nonqualified deferred compensation plan the deferred compensation plan provides that participants may defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 85% of their annual bonus with respect to any given plan year, subject to a $2 thousand per plan year minimum. the company may make discretionary contributions to participant accounts. the company credited accounts of participants of long service to the company with certain discretionary amounts (pension plan benefit restoration contributions) in lieu of benefits that previously accrued under the companys retirement income plan up to a maximum of $245
thousand. the company made pension plan benefit restoration contributions under the deferred compensation plan for five years. the first contribution was made in january 2007 for those participants who were employed for all of the
2006 plan year. only employees with five full years of vested service on june 30, 2005 qualified for pension plan benefit restoration contributions. under the deferred compensation plan, salary and bonus deferrals and pension plan benefit restoration contributions are fully vested. any discretionary contributions are subject to vesting in accordance with the matching contribution vesting schedule set forth in the rollins 401(k) savings plan in which a participant participates. the company made its last contributions associated with this plan during the first quarter of 2011.
accounts will be credited with hypothetical earnings, and/or debited with hypothetical losses, based on the performance of certain measurement funds. account values are calculated as if the funds from deferrals and company credits had been converted into shares or other ownership units of selected measurement funds by purchasing
(or selling, where relevant) such shares or units at the current purchase price of the relevant measurement fund at the time of the participants selection. deferred compensation plan benefits are unsecured general obligations of the company to the participants, and these obligations rank in parity with the companys other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. the company has established a rabbi trust, which it uses to voluntarily set aside amounts to indirectly fund any obligations under the deferred compensation plan. to the extent that the companys obligations under the deferred compensation plan exceed assets available under the trust, the company would be required to seek additional funding sources to fund its liability under the deferred compensation plan.
generally, the deferred compensation plan provides for distributions of any deferred amounts upon the earliest to occur of a participants death, disability, retirement or other termination of employment (a termination event).
however, for any deferrals of salary and bonus (but not company contributions), participants would be entitled to designate a distribution date which is prior to a termination event. generally, the deferred compensation plan allows a participant to elect to receive distributions under the deferred compensation plan in installments or lump-sum payments.
at december 31, 2014 the deferred compensation plan had 70 life insurance policies with a net face value of $42.4
million. the cash surrender value of these life insurance policies were worth $12.7 million and $11.5 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. the company had $13.7 million in deferred compensation assets as of december
31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, included within other assets on the companys consolidated statements of financial position and $13.7 million and $12.8 million in deferred compensation liability as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, located within long-term accrued liabilities on the companys consolidated statements of financial position. the amounts of assets were marked to fair value.
14.  stock-based compensation stock compensation plans stock options and time lapse restricted shares (tlrss) have been issued to officers and other management employees under the companys employee stock incentive plan.
stock options the companys stock options generally vest over a five-year period and expire ten years from the issuance date. for the year ended december 31, 2014, the company did not issue any shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options by employees. the company issued 1 thousand shares in 2013.
in order to estimate the fair value of stock options, the company used the black-scholes option valuation model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of publicly traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions and these assumptions can vary over time.
option activity under the companys stock option plan as of december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and changes during the year ended december 31, 2014 were as follows:
(in                                                 exercise    contractual term       intrinsic thousands except per share data)    shares             price          (in years)           value
the aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the companys closing stock price on the last trading day of the year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on that day. the amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the companys stock.
the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was zero, less than $0.1 million, and, $0.5 million, respectively. exercise of options during the years ended december
time lapse restricted shares and restricted stock units tlrss provide for the issuance of a share of the companys common stock at no cost to the holder and generally vest after a certain stipulated number of years from the grant date, depending on the terms of the issue. tlrss vest in
20 percent increments starting with the second anniversary of the grant, over six years from the date of grant.
during these years, grantees receive all dividends declared and retain voting rights for the granted shares. the agreements under which the restricted stock is issued provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions established under the plans have lapsed.
the company issued time lapse restricted shares of 0.4 million, 0.5 million, and 0.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
the company issues new shares from its authorized but unissued share pool. at december 31, 2014, approximately 5.7
million shares of the companys common stock were reserved for issuance. in accordance with the fasb asc topic 718,
 compensation - stock compensation,the company recognizes the fair value of the award on a straight line basis over the service periods of each award. the company estimates restricted share forfeiture rates based on its historical experience.

●                                                                   the base rate, which shall mean the highest of (i) the per annum rate which the administrative agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate, (ii) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50% per annum, and (iii) the adjusted libor rate
(which equals libor as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the u.s. federal reserve) determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one (1) month, plus 1.0% per annum.
●                                                                with respect to any eurodollar borrowings, the adjusted libor rate plus an additional amount, which varies between .75% and 1.00%, based upon rollins then-current debt-to-ebitda ratio. as of december 31, 2014, the additional rate allocated was .75%.

critical accounting policies the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require managements most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows:
accrual for termite contracts - the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications, repairs and associated labor and chemicals, settlements, awards and other costs relative to termite control services. factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation. it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the companys business practices. however, it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims. accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the companys consolidated statements of financial position.
accrued insurance - the company self-insures, up to specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers compensation and vehicle liability. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self-insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semi-annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information. the actuarial study is a major consideration in establishing the reserve, along with managements knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances. managements judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside managements knowledge and control. additionally, historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events. the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims. initiatives that have been implemented include pre-employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers, post-offer physicals for new employees, and pre-hire, random and post-accident drug testing. the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited-duty basis.
revenue recognition - the companys revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed. for certain revenue types, because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services, certain accounting estimates are utilized. residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis, while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month. in general, pest control customers sign an initial one-year contract, and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed. for pest control customers, the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services. the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered. the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues.
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting. at the inception of a new baiting services contract, upon quality control review of the installation, the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations, initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations. a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element. this portion is recognized as income on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits. the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price. there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions. baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight-line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits.
revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term; and, the cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred. for outstanding claims, an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred (including legal costs) based upon current factors and historical information. the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts, these costs are incurred over the contract term. as the revenue is being deferred, the future cost of reinspections, reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred. the company accrues for noticed claims. the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses.
contingency accruals - the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. in accordance with the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") accounting standards codification ("asc") topic 450 "contingencies," management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation. estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel. because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation, judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued. however, in the opinion of management, the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition or results of operations. contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities on the company's consolidated statements of financial position.
defined benefit pension plans - in 2005, the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins, inc. defined benefit plan, although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june 2005. the company terminated the waltham services, llc salaried pension plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum distribution in december 2012. the company also includes the waltham services, llc hourly employee pension plan to the companys financial statements. the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with the fasb asc topic 715 compensation- retirement benefits, and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. with the assistance of the actuary, the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.
the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment adviser. differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains or losses ultimately affects future pension expense. the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets is 7.0% which is unchanged from the prior year.
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company utilizes a yield curve approach. the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the companys expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecast and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. the discount rate was 4.15% as of december 31, 2014 compared to 5.20% in 2013 and 4.17% in 2012. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation.
as set forth in note 13 to the company's financial statements, included among the asset categories for the plan's investments are real estate, tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds. these investments are categorized as level 3 investments and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. in accordance with accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2009-12 "investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent)," these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested. these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.

new accounting standards recently adopted accounting standards in february 2013, the financial accounting standard board (fasb) issued accounting standard update (asu) no. 2013-02, reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (asu 2013-02) to comprehensive income. the guidance requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
in february 2013, the fasb issued asu no. 2013-04, liabilities (topic 405): obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date (a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force). this guidance requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation within the scope of this guidance is fixed at the reporting date. this stipulates that (1) it will include the amount the entity agreed to pay for the arrangement between them and the other entities that are also obligated to the liability and (2) any additional amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of the other entities. the objective of this update is to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
in july 2013, the fasb issued asu no 2013-11, income taxes (topic 740): presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. topic 740, income taxes, does not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. there is diversity in practice in the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in those instances. some entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a liability unless the unrecognized tax benefit is directly associated with a tax position taken in a tax year that results in, or that resulted in, the recognition of a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward for that year and the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward has not been utilized. other entities present unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss or tax credit carryforward in certain circumstances. the objective of the amendments in this update is to eliminate that diversity in practice. the provision of the new guidance was effective as of the beginning of our 2014 fiscal year. adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the companys reported results of operations or financial position.
recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in 2015 or later in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, presentation of financial statements (topic 205 and 360): reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of components of an entity. asu 2014-08 amends the definition for what types of asset disposals are to be considered discontinued operations, and amends the required disclosures for discontinued operations and assets held for sale. asu 2014-08 also enhances the convergence of the fasb's and the international accounting standard board's reporting requirements for discontinued operations. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december 15, 2014, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): "revenue from contracts with customers" (asu 2014-09) which requires companies to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control rather than when companies have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service. asu 2014-09 is effective retrospectively for the annual or interim reporting periods beginning on or after december 15, 2016. the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu 2014-09 on its financial statements. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.
in january 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-01, income statement-extraordinary and unusual items (topic 225): income statement-extraordinary and unusual items (asu 2015-01) eliminate the gaap concept of extraordinary items. the new guidance eliminates the separate presentation of extraordinary items, net of tax and the related earnings per share, but does not affect the requirement to disclose material items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015, and interim periods within annual periods beginning on or after december 15, 2015. the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on the company's reported results of operations or financial position.

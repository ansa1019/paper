risk factors set out above and below, as well as a number of other factors, including the performance of comparable companies or the medical device industry, or changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts.
table of contents the quarterly and full-year financial guidance we provide to investors and analysts with insight to our view of our future performance is based on assumptions about our sales and operating results. due to the nature of our business and the numerous factors that can impact our sales and operating performance, including those described above, our financial guidance may vary from actual results. if we fail to meet any financial guidance that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year, the price of our common stock could decline.
we face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.
the cardiovascular medical device industry is highly competitive. we compete with many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, better brand or name recognition, and broader product offerings. our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, breadth of product line, clinical outcomes, product availability, price, availability and rate of reimbursement, and services provided by the manufacturer. in addition, our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances, and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies. our sales, technical, and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing, and selling of new and existing products. if we are unable to recruit, hire, develop, and retain a talented, competitive workforce, our ability to compete may be adversely affected. our competitive position can also be adversely affected by product problems, physician advisories and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of quality in the medical device industry. our position can shift as a result of any of these factors.
see "competition" under "business" included herein.
the health care industry has been consolidating, and organizations such as gpos, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts, such as the united states veterans administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our health care provider customers. as a result, transactions with
table of contents customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts. the purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing. if we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants. even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies. further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues, profit margins, business, financial condition, and results of operations. we expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide health care industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our inability to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive company information could have a material adverse effect on our business.
our success and competitive position are dependent in part upon our proprietary intellectual property. we rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we expect to continue to do so. although we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of means, we cannot guarantee that the protective steps we have taken are adequate to protect these rights. patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged and held invalid. in addition, as our patents expire, we may be unsuccessful in extending their protection through patent term extensions. the expiration of, or the failure to maintain or extend our patents, could have a material adverse effect on us.
we also rely on confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants, and other third parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary information. these agreements could be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach. in addition, others could independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary information.
our intellectual property, other proprietary technology, and other sensitive company information is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage, or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data, or misappropriation or misuse of it by those with permitted access, and other events. while we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other information, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber-attacks, or other events. such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.
we spend significant resources to enforce our intellectual property rights, sometimes resulting in litigation.
intellectual property litigation is complex and can be expensive and time-consuming. however, our efforts in this regard may not be successful. we may not be able to detect infringement. in addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. patent litigation can result in substantial cost and diversion of effort. intellectual property protection may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, enabling our competitors to capture increased market position. the invalidation of key intellectual property rights or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits filed to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.
third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.
during recent years, we and our competitors have been involved in substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. from time to time, we have been and may in the future be forced to defend against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, and such intellectual property litigation is typically costly and time-consuming. adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or
table of contents injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties and, if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us. in addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies.
third parties could also obtain patents that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties. such licenses may materially increase our expenses. if we are unable to redesign products or obtain a license, we might have to exit a particular product offering.
we and our customers are subject to rigorous governmental regulations and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations. in addition, failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, design, sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, advertising, promotion, and distribution of our products.
we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer. as a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda's quality system regulation ("qsr") requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, design, quality control, and documentation procedures. the fda may also inspect our compliance with requirements related to adverse event reporting, recalls or corrections (field actions), the conduct of clinical studies, and other requirements. in the european union, we are required to maintain certain ce mark and iso certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr, ce mark, iso, or similar requirements, this could delay or interrupt product production or sales and/or lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, or other consequences, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects.
medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the united states. in addition, the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post-marketing programs. in addition, the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. federal regulations also require us to report certain recalls or corrective actions to the fda. furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance, approval, or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and clearances or approvals may not be granted for products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all. delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects. at any time after approval of a product for commercial sale, the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with qsr requirements, and/or current medical device reporting regulations, or other regulatory requirements. noncompliance with applicable requirements may subject us or responsible individuals to sanctions including civil money penalties, product seizure, injunction, or criminal prosecution. in addition, the fda may withhold or delay pre-market approval of our products until the noncompliance is resolved. product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval.
table of contents regulatory agencies in the united states or other international geographies from time to time limit or ban the use of certain materials used in the manufacture of our products, require collection and disposal of products at the end of their lifecycle, and require disclosure of the origin of certain raw materials in our products.
noncompliance with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.
the united states physician payment sunshine act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, also impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device, pharmaceutical, and biologics companies for certain financial relationships with united states health care providers and teaching hospitals. failure to submit required information or submitting incorrect information may result in significant civil monetary penalties.
we are also subject to various united states and international laws pertaining to health care pricing, anti-
corruption, and fraud and abuse, including prohibitions on kickbacks and the submission of false claims laws and restrictions on relationships with physicians and other referral sources. these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if we are found not to be in compliance. violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions against us and our officers and employees, including substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs.
despite our implementation of robust compliance processes, we may be subject, from time to time, to inspections, investigations, and other enforcement actions by governmental authorities. if we are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the applicable governmental authority can impose fines, delay, suspend, or revoke regulatory clearances or approvals, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose marketing or operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees, and institute criminal prosecution. moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute. any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above, commencement of an enforcement proceeding, inspection, or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.
in recent years, the medical device industry has been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including by the fda, numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, as well as members of congress. this has included increased regulation, enforcement, inspections, and governmental investigations of the medical device industry and disclosure of financial relationships with health care professionals. we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by governmental authorities, both foreign and domestic, may increase compliance costs, exposure to litigation, and other adverse effects to our operations.
the regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures, including early clinical experiences and regulatory studies. unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us, our competitors, or third parties, or perceptions regarding this clinical data, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market's view of our future prospects. such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or cost-effective manner or result in a commercially viable product. failure to successfully complete
table of contents these trials or procedures in a timely and cost-effective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects. clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results. further, preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis. in addition, results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience. if preliminary clinical results are later contradicted, or if initial results cannot be supported by actual long-term studies or clinical experience, our business could be adversely affected. clinical trials or procedures may be suspended or terminated by us, the fda or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks.
certain of our products, including pericardial tissue valves, are manufactured using bovine tissue. concerns relating to the potential transmission of bse, commonly known as "mad cow disease," from cows to humans may result in reduced acceptance of products containing bovine materials. certain medical device regulatory agencies have considered whether to continue to permit the sale of medical devices that incorporate bovine material. we obtain bovine tissue only from closely controlled sources within the united states and australia. the bovine tissue used in our pericardial tissue valves is from tissue types considered by global health and regulatory organizations to have shown no risk of infectibility for the suspected bse infectious agent. we have not experienced any significant adverse impact on our sales as a result of concerns regarding bse, but no assurance can be given that such an impact may not occur in the future.
if third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or impose other cost containment measures to reduce reimbursement levels, our ability to profitably sell our products will be harmed.
we sell our products and technologies to hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services provided to patients from third-party payors, such as government programs (both domestic and international), private insurance plans, and managed care programs. the ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies. the availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact acceptance of new products.
third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. there can be no assurance that levels of reimbursement, if any, will not be decreased in the future, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-
party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products. the introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of health care expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed. hospitals or physicians may respond to such cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies. in addition, the 2010 united states health care law could adversely affect reimbursement levels for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our product pricing and profitability.
initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, are underway in several countries around the world. in many countries, customers are reimbursed for our products under a government operated insurance system. under such a system, the government periodically reviews reimbursement levels and may limit patient access. if a government were to decide to reduce reimbursement levels, our product pricing could be adversely affected.
third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by such third-party payors, or was used for an unapproved indication. third-party payors may also deny reimbursement for experimental procedures and devices. we believe that many of our existing products are cost-effective, even though the
table of contents one-time cost may be significant, because they are intended to reduce overall health care costs over a long period of time. we cannot be certain that these third-party payors will recognize these cost savings instead of merely focusing on the lower initial costs associated with competing therapies. if our products are not considered cost-
use of our products in unapproved circumstances could expose us to liabilities.
the marketing approval from the fda and other regulators of certain of our products are, or are expected to be, limited to specific indications. we are prohibited by law from marketing or promoting any unapproved use of our products. physicians, however, can use these products in ways or circumstances other than those strictly within the scope of the regulatory approval. although the product training we provide to physicians and other health care professionals is limited to approved uses or for clinical trials, no assurance can be given that claims might not be asserted against us if our products are used in ways or for procedures that are not approved.
our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the cleanup of hazardous substance releases, and emissions or discharges into the air or water. we have incurred and may incur expenditures in the future in connection with environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations. new laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.
the success of many of our products depends upon strong relationships with certain key physicians.
the development, marketing, and sale of many of our products requires us to maintain working relationships with physicians upon whom we rely to provide considerable knowledge and experience. these physicians may assist us as researchers, marketing consultants, product trainers and consultants, inventors, and as public speakers. if new laws, regulations, or other developments limit our ability to maintain strong relationships with these professionals or to continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

overview we are the global leader in the science of heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring. driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with clinicians to develop innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, enabling them to save and enhance lives. we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: united states, europe, japan, and rest of world. our products are categorized into the following main areas: transcatheter heart valve therapy, surgical heart valve therapy, and critical care.
effective january 1, 2014, we changed our method of accounting for certain intellectual property litigation expenses related to the defense and enforcement of our issued patents. under the new method of accounting, these legal costs are expensed in the period incurred; previously, these costs were capitalized and
gross profit as a percentage of net                         73.1  %        74.7  %        74.2  %      (1.6  ) pts.     0.5  pts.
our sales growth was driven by our transcatheter heart valve therapy products which, in europe, benefited from the launch of theedwards sapien 3transcatheter heart valve, and in the united states, benefited from the launch of theedwards sapien xttranscatheter heart valve. our gross profit margin was negatively impacted in 2014 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased incentive compensation due to our strong performance, and higher manufacturing costs, primarily for our operations in utah. net income in 2014 and 2013 benefited from special items. in 2014, we received $750.0 million ($487.9 million, net of tax) from medtronic, inc. ("medtronic") for an upfront payment due under a litigation settlement agreement, and in 2013, we received from medtronic an $83.6
million ($52.3 million, net of tax) litigation award.
healthcare environment, opportunities and challenges the medical device industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve. our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property. to strengthen our leadership and enable future growth opportunities, in 2014 we invested 14.9% of our net sales in research and development. in a consolidating industry, we believe our focus on innovation and a robust product pipeline will continue to help us compete more effectively, sustain our successes, and build long-term value for our shareholders. the following is a summary of important developments during 2014:
table of contents we are dedicated to generating robust clinical and economic evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the new healthcare environment, with the goal of enhancing the value of delivering comprehensive care.

during the first quarter of 2014, we completed enrollment in the 500 patient cohort of the partner ii trial studying theedwards sapien 3transcatheter valve system in high risk and inoperable patients. in january 2014, we received fda approval to expand the partner ii trial to include a 1,000 patient single-arm, non-randomized cohort to study theedwards sapien 3transcatheter valve system in the treatment of intermediate-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. enrollment was completed in september 2014. at the end of 2014, we submitted our pre-
market approval application forsapien 3in the united states.
in january 2014, we received ce mark for theedwards sapien 3transcatheter valve system in europe. in june 2014, we received fda approval for theedwards sapien xttranscatheter heart valve in the united states for the treatment of high-risk and inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
in april 2014, we received ce mark for our advancededwards intuity elitevalve system. this next-generation, rapid deployment system facilitates smaller incisions in surgical aortic valve replacement procedures. in the united states, we completed enrollment of patients in our transform trial foredwards intuity elite,and we continued enrolling patients in our commence clinical trial, which is studying our next-generationglxadvanced tissue platform applied to themagna easeaortic surgical valve and themagna mitral easevalve.
critical care the $16.6 million increase in net sales of critical care products in 2014 was due primarily to enhanced surgical recovery products, and core hemodynamic products outside the united states, partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $12.0 million, due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar.
the $23.4 million decrease in net sales of critical care products in 2013 was due primarily to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $28.9 million, due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar.
in june 2014, we received fda clearance for theclearsightsystem, a noninvasive monitor that provides clinicians access to blood volume and blood flow information for patients at moderate or high risk of post-surgical complications, in whom invasive monitoring would not be used. the clearsightsystem is part of our enhanced surgical recovery product portfolio. in september 2014, due to a strategic shift of our investment initiatives, we decided to discontinue our automated glucose monitoring program.

the $36.0 million increase in sg&a expenses in 2013 was due primarily to (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in the united states and japan, mainly to support the transcatheter heart valve therapy program and (2) the 2.3%
united states medical device excise tax, or $15.8 million, which became effective in 2013. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency, which reduced expenses by $12.4 million due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar. the decrease in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2013 was due primarily to decreased sg&a expenses in europe as a percentage of net sales.
percentage of net sales the increase in research and development expenses in 2014 was due primarily to new aortic and mitral transcatheter heart valve therapy product development efforts, additional investments in clinical studies in the surgical heart valve therapy program, and higher performance-based incentive compensation. the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to higher net sales.
the increase in research and development expenses in 2013 was due primarily to additional investments in clinical studies and new product development efforts in the transcatheter heart valve therapy program.
intellectual property litigation (income) expense, net in may 2014, we entered into an agreement with medtronic to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies, including all cases related to transcatheter heart valves. pursuant to the agreement, we received an upfront payment from medtronic in the amount of $750.0 million. for further information, see note 4 to the
in february 2013, we received $83.6 million from medtronic in satisfaction of the initial april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the united states andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, including accrued interest.

reserve for uncertain tax positions as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $192.3
million and $127.7 million, respectively. we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by $34.3 million and
$30.9 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments. the net amounts of $158.0 million and

we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.
as of december 31, 2014, we had accrued $6.8 million (net of $5.0 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of december 31, 2013, we had accrued $4.5 million (net of $3.3 million tax benefit)
of interest related to uncertain tax positions. during 2014, 2013, and 2012, we recognized interest expense, net of tax benefit, of $2.3 million, $1.4 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, in "provision for income taxes" on the consolidated statements of operations.
we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. furthermore, we may later decide to
table of contents challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal. the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law. management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
at december 31, 2014, all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008. during the third quarter of 2013, the internal revenue service ("irs") completed its fieldwork for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. the case is currently in suspense pending finalization of an advance pricing agreement
("apa") and joint committee of taxation approval. the irs began its examination of the 2011 and 2012 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2013.
we have also entered into an apa process between the switzerland and the united states governments for the years
during 2014, we also filed with the irs a request for a pre-filing agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 (see note 4 to the
management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions. based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability. however, if the apa and/or pre-filing agreement is finalized in the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 included (1) $262.1 million of tax expense associated with a $750.0 million litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 (see note 4 to the "consolidated financial statements") and (2) $4.8 million of tax benefits from the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions.
the federal research credit expired on december 31, 2011 and was reinstated on january 2, 2013. as a result, the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2012 was calculated without a benefit for the federal research credit. the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 included (1) an $8.4 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and (2) $31.3 million of tax expense associated with the
$83.6 million litigation award received from medtronic in february 2013 (see note 4 to the "consolidated financial statements").
we have received tax incentives in puerto rico, the dominican republic, singapore, and switzerland. the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 by $0.63, $0.44, and $0.39, respectively. the puerto rico, dominican republic, singapore, and switzerland grants provide our manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028, 2030 (subject to review beginning in 2015), 2024, and 2015, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, amounts available under credit facilities, and cash from operations. we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments for the next twelve months.
table of contents time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. we believe that we have the financial flexibility to attract long-term capital to fund short-term and long-term growth objectives.
however, no assurances can be given that such long-term capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.
we believe that cash held in the united states, in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations, are sufficient to fund our united states operating requirements for the next twelve months. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the united states have historically been used to fund international operations and acquire businesses outside of the united states, although a portion of those amounts may, from time to time, be subject to temporary intercompany loans into the united states. as of december 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in the united states and outside the united states were
$651.7 million and $787.1 million, respectively. the majority of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the united states relates to undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, which are considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested. repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the united states are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions, and may be subject to withholding and other taxes. the potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the united states and the respective foreign jurisdictions.
we have a five-year credit agreement ("the credit agreement") which provides up to an aggregate of $750.0 million in borrowings in multiple currencies. as of december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement. in october 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes due october
from time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors. we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity, and the market price of our common stock. during 2014, we repurchased a total of 4.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $300.0 million, and as of december 31, 2014, had remaining authority to purchase $952.5 million of our common stock. for further information, see note 13 to the
net cash flows provided byoperating activitiesof $1,022.3 million for 2014 increased $549.6 million from 2013 due primarily to (1) the $750.0 million upfront payment received from medtronic under a litigation settlement agreement, (2) a lower bonus payout in 2014 associated with 2013 bonuses, and (3) improved operating performance.
these increases were partially offset by (1) income tax payments of $224.5 million related to the medtronic settlement, (2) the prior year receipt of $83.6 million from medtronic in satisfaction of the initial april 2010
jury award of damages for infringement of the united states andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, and (3) the
$50.0 million charitable contribution to the edwards lifesciences foundation in 2014.
net cash flows provided by operating activities of $472.7 million for 2013 increased $110.6 million from 2012 due primarily to (1) the receipt of $83.6 million from medtronic, inc. in satisfaction of the april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the u.s. andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, (2) increased collection of accounts receivable, and (3) improved operating performance. these increases were partially offset by (1) a $22.7
million increase in inventory purchases to support future product launches and (2) a $17.0 million impact from excess tax benefits from stock plans, primarily as a result of the realization of excess tax benefits that had been previously unrealized due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the united states in 2011 and 2012.
net cash used ininvesting activitiesof $633.0 million in 2014 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $527.4 million and capital expenditures of $82.9 million.
table of contents net cash used in investing activities of $412.7 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $300.9 million and capital expenditures of $109.0 million.
net cash used infinancing activitiesof $153.0 million in 2014 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of
$300.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $113.3 million, and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $49.4 million (including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits).
net cash provided by financing activities of $34.9 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net proceeds from debt of
$409.6 million, the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $73.5 million (including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits), and proceeds from stock plans of $45.5 million, partially offset by repurchases of common stock of $496.9 million.
a summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2014 were as follows
capital commitment                                  3.1             0.8         2.3                          
commitments total contractual cash        $                   746.0    $       43.6    $   58.7    $  625.2    $     18.5
anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. the total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of december 31, 2014 was $49.3 million. this amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets.
therefore, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. see note 12 to the "
consolidated financial statements " for further information. (b) capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay to our limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees. these investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and/or when these payments will be made. (c) as of december 31, 2014, the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $204.1 million. we have entered into an apa process between the switzerland and the united states governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters.
these transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain. management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
table of contents contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. in situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment, we have included those payments in the table above.
however, we have excluded from the table contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial. we estimate that these contingent payments could be up to approximately $110.0 million if all milestones or other contingent obligations were met.
critical accounting policies and estimates our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the "consolidated financial statements." certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). in evaluating our transactions, management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. we also use outside experts where appropriate. we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
revenue recognition when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. these adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances. these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt. if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be impacted.
in addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings.
for these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.
our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor (at our distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer. we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributor's inventory. this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates. we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
table of contents excess and obsolete inventory the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess, obsolete, and expired inventory. we base our provisions for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales. a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory in the future. in addition, our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. uncertain timing of next-
generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, increasing levels of consigned inventory, and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
intangible assets and long-lived assets we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases. the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. the determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to ipr&d acquired in business combinations, are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value, including estimation of future cash flows, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and estimates of long-term growth rates.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions. we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes. we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as the progress of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
for additional details on our income taxes, see note 2 and note 16 to the "consolidated financial statements."
based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions. the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes option valuation model. the fair value of market-based restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. the black-scholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term. stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures. judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. we manage these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. our investment strategy is focused on preserving capital and supporting our liquidity requirements, while earning a reasonable market return. we invest in a variety of fixed-rate debt securities, primarily time deposits, commercial paper, u.s. government and agency securities, municipal securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and municipal securities. our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the market value of our investments may decline if current market interest rates rise, which could result in a realized loss if we choose or are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity, which we currently do not anticipate. as of december 31, 2014, we had $999.5 million of investments in fixed-rate debt securities which had an average remaining term to maturity of approximately 0.5 years. a hypothetical 25 basis point increase in interest rates at december 31, 2014 would have resulted in a $1.2 million decrease in the fair value of these investments.
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our debt obligations. as of december 31, 2014, we had $600.0 million of notes outstanding that carry a fixed rate, and also had available a $750.0 million credit agreement that carries a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor"). as of december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement. to diversify our interest rate risk, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million. the critical terms of the swaps match the critical terms of $300.0 million of the debt issuance, effectively converting that portion of the fixed-rate issue to a floating variable rate based on a 6-month libor benchmark. based on our year end 2014 and 2013 variable debt levels, a hypothetical 10% increase in our weighted-average interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by approximately $5.2 million and $6.0
currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. these risks include the translation of local currency balances and results of our non-united states subsidiaries into united states dollars, currency gains and losses related to intercompany and third-party transactions denominated in currencies other than a location's functional currency, and currency gains and losses associated with intercompany loans. our principal currency exposures relate to the euro and the japanese yen. our objective is to minimize the volatility of our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options contracts. we do not hedge our exposure related to our net investments in our non-united states subsidiaries. the total notional amounts of our derivative financial instruments entered into for foreign currency management purposes at december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $770.4 million and $805.5 million, respectively. a hypothetical 10% increase/decrease in the value of the united states dollar against all hedged currencies would increase/decrease the fair value of these derivative contracts by $46.3 million and $51.1 million, respectively.
any gains or losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions, so the net impact would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.
credit risk derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the financial institution counterparty should default. it is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy. at december 31, 2014, all derivative financial instruments were with bank counterparties assigned investment grade ratings by national rating agencies. we further diversify our derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. we have not experienced a counterparty default and do not anticipate any non-performance by our current derivative counterparties.
concentrations of risk we invest excess cash in a variety of fixed-rate debt securities, and diversify the investments between financial institutions.
in the normal course of business, we provide credit to customers in the health care industry, perform credit evaluations of these customers, and maintain allowances for potential credit losses, which have historically been adequate compared to actual losses. in 2014, we had no customers that represent 10% or more of our total net sales or accounts receivable, net.
we continue to do business with foreign governments in certain european countries that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions. these conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a reduction in value and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries. in addition, we may also be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries. as of december 31, 2014, our accounts receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, from customers in certain european countries were $69.7 million.
2014, we had $839.4 million of investments in fixed-rate debt securities designated as held-to-maturity, of which
$72.3 million were long-term, and $160.1 million of investments in fixed-rate debt securities designated as available-for-sale, of which $142.2 million were long-term. as of december 31, 2014, we had recorded unrealized losses of $0.4 million on the available-for-sale investments in "accumulated other comprehensive loss," net of tax.
should we choose or be forced to sell an investment that has declined in market value prior to its maturity, we may be required to realize losses in principal. in addition, we invest in equity instruments of public and private companies. as of december 31, 2014, we had $26.4 million of investments in equity instruments of other companies and had recorded unrealized gains of $0.4 million on these investments in "accumulated other comprehensive loss,"
net of tax. should these companies experience a decline in financial condition or fail to meet certain development milestones, the decline in the investments' values may be considered other than temporary and impairment charges may be necessary.

consolidated statements of stockholders' equity              47
other schedules are not applicable and have not been submitted
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of edwards lifesciences corporation and its subsidiaries at december 31,
2014 and december 31, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014, based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework
(2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report on internal control over financial reporting under item 9a. our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1. description of business edwards lifesciences corporation ("edwards lifesciences" or the "company") conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: united states, europe, japan, and rest of world. edwards lifesciences is focused on technologies that treat structural heart disease and critically ill patients. the products and technologies provided by edwards lifesciences are categorized into the following main areas:
transcatheter heart valve therapy, surgical heart valve therapy, and critical care.
2. summary of significant accounting policies principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of edwards lifesciences and its majority-
owned subsidiaries. all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. the company reviews its investments in other entities to determine whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("vie"). the company would be the primary beneficiary of the vie, and would be required to consolidate the vie, if it has the power to direct the significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that may be significant to the vie. based on the company's analysis, it determined it is not the primary beneficiary of any vies; however, future events may require vies to be consolidated if the company becomes the primary beneficiary.
due to the company's change in accounting principle (see note 3), certain legal costs previously reported on the consolidated statements of operations in "selling, general, and administrative expenses" and "special charges" have been reclassed to "intellectual property litigation (income) expense, net" to conform to the current year presentation. in addition, certain reclassifications related to the presentation of income taxes and special charges have been made in the prior years' consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to the current year presentation. these reclassifications had no impact on net income or on the cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.
use of estimates the consolidated financial statements of edwards lifesciences have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america ("gaap") which have been applied consistently in all material respects. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates.
foreign currency translation when the local currency of the company's foreign entities is the functional currency, all assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. income and expense items are translated at the weighted-average exchange rate prevailing during the period. the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments for these entities are deferred and reported in stockholders' equity as a component of "accumulated other comprehensive loss." the effects of foreign currency transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency are included in "other expense, net."
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product, provided that an agreement of sale exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations, revenue is recognized at the time the customer has used the inventory.
the company's principal sales terms provide for title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer, limited right of return, and no unusual provisions or conditions. when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products, an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. these adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances. these provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. other than in limited circumstances, product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt. in addition, the company may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. for these transactions, the company defers recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer.
the company's sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to the company's united states distributors represents the difference between the company's sales price to the distributor (at the company's distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer. this distributor rebate is recorded by the company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor's accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor. the company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor's inventory. this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates. the company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
the company also offers volume rebates to certain group purchasing organizations ("gpos") and customers based upon target sales levels. for volume rebates offered to gpos, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the gpo, as the company expects to pay in cash. for volume rebates offered to customers, the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and accounts receivable, as the company expects a net payment from the customer. the provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers' contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid. the company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated.
cash equivalents the company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. these investments are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
investments the company invests its excess cash in fixed-rate debt securities, including time deposits, commercial paper, u.s.
government and agency securities, municipal securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and municipal securities. investments with maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term, and investments with maturities greater than one year are classified as long-term. investments that the company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost. investments that are classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in
"accumulated other comprehensive loss." the company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in fixed-rate debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date.
the company also has long-term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development. certain of these investments are designated as available-for-sale. other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting, as appropriate. the company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations, whereby the company owns a minimum of 5% of the investee's outstanding voting stock, under the equity method of accounting. these investments are recorded at the amount of the company's investment and adjusted each period for the company's share of the investee's income or loss and dividends paid. as investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair values, the company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment's fair value.
realized gains and losses on investments that are sold are determined using the specific identification method and recorded to "other expense, net." income relating to investments in fixed-rate debt securities is recorded to
the company periodically reviews its investments for impairment. when the fair value of an investment declines below cost, management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other-than-
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. when evaluating its
allowances for doubtful accounts related to receivables from customers in certain european countries that have historically paid beyond the stated terms, the company's analysis considers a number of factors including evidence of the customer's ability to comply with credit terms, economic conditions, and procedures implemented by the company to collect the historical receivables. additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated, or for customer-specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. the allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.3
a write-down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete, nearing its expiration date (generally triggered at six months prior to expiration), is damaged, or slow moving (generally defined as quantities in excess of a two-year supply). the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $32.2 million and
40 years for buildings and improvements, from 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment, and from 3 to 10 years for software. leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related facility leases or the asset, whichever is shorter. straight-line and accelerated methods of depreciation are used for income tax purposes.
impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning
the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill, to those reporting units. the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the company's market capitalization and a market revenue multiple. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the company measures the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. in 2014, 2013, and 2012, the company did not record any impairment loss as the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying value.
indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to in-process research and development ("ipr&d") acquired in business combinations. the estimated fair values of ipr&d projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. upon successful completion of the project, the capitalized amount is amortized over its estimated useful life. if the project is abandoned, all remaining capitalized amounts are written off immediately. indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. an impairment loss is recognized when the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value. ipr&d projects acquired in an asset acquisition are expensed unless the project has an alternative future use.
management reviews the carrying amounts of other finite-lived intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. impairment indicators include, among other conditions, cash flow deficits, historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit, and adverse legal or regulatory developments. if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable, based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods, their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value. estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company's financial statements or tax returns. the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and adjusting the amount, if necessary. the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are both historical experience and the company's forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company's effective tax rate on future earnings.
when assessing whether a windfall tax benefit relating to stock-based compensation has been realized, the company follows the with and without approach, under which the windfall benefit is recognized only if an incremental benefit is provided after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company. consideration is given only to the direct impacts of stock awards when calculating the amount of windfalls and shortfalls.
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating the company's uncertain tax positions and determining its
provision for income taxes. the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort. for tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority.
earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during a period. employee equity share options, nonvested shares, and similar equity instruments granted by the company are treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share. diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and in-the-money options. the dilutive impact of the restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and in-the-money options is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method.
under the treasury stock method, the amount that the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that the company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in "additional paid-in capital" when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares. potential common share equivalents have been excluded where their inclusion would be anti-
stock options, restricted stock units, and market-based restricted stock units to purchase approximately 2.4
stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions. stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period (vesting period) on a straight-line basis. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock units and market-based restricted stock units, the company issues common stock.
upon retirement, all unvested stock options are immediately forfeited. in addition, upon retirement, a participant will immediately vest in 25% of restricted stock units for each full year of employment with the company measured from the grant date. all remaining unvested restricted stock units are immediately forfeited. for market-based restricted stock units, upon retirement and in certain other specified cases, a participant will receive a pro-
rated portion of the shares that would ultimately be issued based on attainment of the performance goals as determined on the vesting date. the pro-rated portion is based on the participant's whole months of service with the company during the performance period prior to the date of termination.
derivatives the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks. it is the company's policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. the company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt into variable-rate debt. these interest rate swaps are designated as fair value hedges and meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. the company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the changes due to currency rate movements in the amount of future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions and certain third-party expenses expected to occur within the next 13
months. these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. certain of the company's locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany and third-party
transactions. the company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to offset the transaction gains and losses associated with certain of these assets and liabilities. all foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries, principally the euro and the japanese yen.
all derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. for each derivative instrument that is designated and effective as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized immediately to earnings, and offsets the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item. the gain or loss on fair value hedges is classified in net interest expense, as they hedge the interest rate risk associated with the company's fixed-rate debt. the company reports in "accumulated other comprehensive loss" the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that are designated, and that qualify, as cash flow hedges.
the company reclassifies these gains and losses into earnings in the same period in which the underlying hedged transactions affect earnings. any hedge ineffectiveness (which represents the amount by which the changes in fair value of the derivative exceed the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction) is recorded in current period earnings. during 2014, 2013, and 2012, the company did not record any gains or losses due to hedge ineffectiveness. the gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which the company does not elect hedge accounting treatment are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in each period based upon the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument. cash flows from derivative financial instruments are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
derivative financial instruments involve credit risk in the event the counterparty should default. it is the company's policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that the company believes to be creditworthy. the company diversifies its derivative financial instruments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. the company also uses international swap dealers association master-netting agreements. under the master-netting agreements, the company's counterparty settlement risk is the net amount of any receipts or payments due between the company and the counterparty financial institution.
recently adopted accounting standards in july 2013, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on income taxes impacting the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits. the guidance requires an entity to net its unrecognized tax benefits against the deferred tax assets for all same jurisdiction net operating loss or similar tax loss carryforwards, or tax credit carryforwards. the guidance was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2013 and interim periods therein. the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company's consolidated financial statements.
new accounting standards not yet adopted in may 2014, the fasb issued an update to the accounting guidance on revenue recognition. the new guidance provides a comprehensive, principles-based approach to revenue recognition, and supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance. the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the guidance also requires improved disclosures on the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016 and
interim periods therein. the new guidance can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change recognized at the date of the initial application. the company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements, and has not yet selected a transition method.
3. change in accounting principle effective january 1, 2014, the company changed its method of accounting for certain intellectual property litigation expenses related to the defense and enforcement of its issued patents. previously, the company capitalized these legal costs if a favorable outcome in the patent defense was determined to be probable, and amortized the capitalized legal costs over the life of the related patent. as of december 31, 2013, the company had remaining unamortized capitalized legal costs of $23.7 million, which, under the previous accounting method, would have been amortized through 2021. under the new method of accounting, these legal costs are expensed in the period they are incurred. the company has retrospectively adjusted the comparative financial statements of prior periods to apply this new method of accounting.
the company believes this change in accounting principle is preferable because (1) as more competitors enter the company's key product markets and the threat of complex intellectual property litigation across multiple jurisdictions increases, it will become more difficult for the company to accurately assess the probability of a favorable outcome in such litigation, and (2) it will enhance the comparability of the company's financial results with those of its peer group because it is the predominant accounting practice in the company's industry.

4. intellectual property litigation (income) expense, net in may 2014, the company entered into an agreement with medtronic, inc. and its affiliates ("medtronic") to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies, including all cases related to transcatheter heart valves.
pursuant to the agreement, all pending cases or appeals in courts and patent offices worldwide have been dismissed, and the parties will not litigate patent disputes with each other in the field of transcatheter valves for the eight-year term of the agreement. under the terms of a patent cross-license that is part of the agreement, medtronic made a one-time, upfront payment to the company in the amount of $750.0 million. in addition, medtronic will pay the company quarterly license royalty payments through april 2022. for sales in the united states, the royalty payments will be based on a percentage of medtronic's sales of transcatheter aortic valves, subject to a minimum annual payment of $40.0 million and a maximum annual payment of $60.0 million. a separate royalty payment will be calculated based on sales of medtronic transcatheter aortic valves manufactured in the united states but sold elsewhere.
the company recognized the upfront payment of $750.0 million in "intellectual property litigation (income) expense, net" during the second quarter of 2014. the accounting guidance limits the amount to be recognized upfront to the amount of cash received. the remaining fair value associated with the past damages element, as well as the license agreement and the covenant not to sue, will be recognized in "net sales" over the term of the license agreement as delivery occurs since the company considers the future royalties to be part of its revenue-earning activities that constitute its ongoing major or central operations.
in february 2013, the company received $83.6 million from medtronic in satisfaction of the initial april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the united states andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, including accrued interest.
the company incurred external legal costs related to intellectual property litigation of $9.6 million, $22.1

charitable foundation contribution in june 2014, the company contributed $50.0 million to the edwards lifesciences foundation, a related-party not-
for-profit organization intended to provide philanthropic support to health- and community-focused charitable organizations. the contribution was irrevocable and was recorded as an expense at the time of payment.
acquisition of ipr&d in december 2014, the company acquired technology for use in its transcatheter mitral valve program. in connection with this acquisition, the company recorded a $10.2 million ipr&d charge, including related expenses. the acquired technology has no alternative uses. additional design developments, bench testing, pre-clinical studies, and human clinical studies must be successfully completed prior to selling any product. under the terms of the purchase agreement, the company must pay an additional $10.0 million if, within 9 years of the acquisition closing date, the company receives ce mark for a transcatheter mitral valve repair or replacement product that incorporates the acquired technology.
settlement in march 2014, the company recorded a $7.5 million charge to settle past and future obligations related to one of its intellectual property agreements.
asset write-down in september 2014, due to a strategic shift of the company's investment initiatives, the company decided to refocus resources from its automated glucose monitoring program. as a result, the company recorded a charge of $3.0 million to write down an intangible asset and fixed assets, and to record severance costs. in addition, the company recorded a $2.0 million charge to "cost of sales," primarily related to the disposal of inventory and equipment held by customers.
realignment expenses in december 2013, the company recorded a $10.4 million charge related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global workforce realignment impacting 118 employees. as of december 31, 2014, the
in december 2012, the company recorded a $9.0 million charge related primarily to severance expenses associated with a global workforce realignment impacting 92 employees. as of december 31, 2014, payments related to the realignment were complete.
ipr&d impairment in december 2013, the company recorded a $5.9 million write-off of ipr&d assets acquired from embrella cardiovascular, inc. for further information, see note 8.

investments in unconsolidated affiliates the company has a number of equity investments in privately and publicly held companies. investments in these unconsolidated affiliates are recorded in "long-term investments" on the consolidated balance sheets, and are as follows:
investments equity method investments cost                                               12.8        14.1

affiliates in december 2014, the company made a $10.0 million investment in one of its existing cost method investees, cardiokinetix, inc. ("cardiokinetix"), for a total investment carrying value of $14.4 million. as part of the agreement, the company also paid $15.0 million, included in "other assets," for an exclusive option to acquire cardiokinetix for up to $375.0 million, depending upon the achievement of certain milestones and regulatory approvals. cardiokinetix is pioneering a catheter-based treatment for heart failure that is currently in the clinical testing phase, and is financed primarily through equity investments. cardiokinetix is a vie; however, the company has determined that it is not cardiokinetix's primary beneficiary since the company does not have the power to direct cardiokinetix's activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. the company made this determination based on the development stage of cardiokinetix's product; the company's inability to exercise influence over cardiokinetix, based on the company's ownership percentage and voting rights, as well as its lack of involvement in day-to-day operations and management decisions; and the fact that the option to acquire cardiokinetix is currently significantly out of the money. accordingly, the company accounts for this investment as a cost method investment. the company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with cardiokinetix is limited to the carrying amount of its investment and the cost of the option to acquire cardiokinetix.

9. debt, credit facilities and lease obligations in october 2013, the company issued $600.0 million of fixed-rate unsecured senior notes (the "notes"). interest is payable semi-annually in arrears, with payment due in april and october. the company may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at specified redemption prices. in addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, the company may be required to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. the notes also include covenants that limit the company's ability to incur secured indebtedness, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets. the following is a summary of the notes as of december 31, 2014 and 2013:
in july 2014, the company entered into a five-year credit agreement ("the credit agreement") which matures on july
18, 2019, and the previous four-year credit agreement was terminated. the credit agreement provides up to an aggregate of $750.0 million in borrowings in multiple currencies. the company
9. debt, credit facilities and lease obligations (continued)
may increase the amount available under the credit agreement, subject to agreement of the lenders, by up to an additional $250.0 million in the aggregate. borrowings generally bear interest at the london interbank offered rate
("libor") plus a spread ranging from 1.0% to 1.5%, depending on the leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement. the company also pays a facility fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.25%, depending on the leverage ratio, on the entire credit commitment available, whether or not drawn. the facility fee is expensed as incurred. during
2014, there were no borrowings under the credit agreement, and the facility fee was 0.15%. issuance costs of $3.0
million are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the credit agreement. the credit agreement is unsecured and contains various financial and other covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement. the company was in compliance with all covenants at december 31, 2014.
during 2014, the spread over libor for borrowings under the previous four-year credit agreement ranged from 0.975%
to 1.2%, and the facility fee ranged from 0.15% to 0.175%.
certain facilities and equipment are leased under operating leases expiring at various dates. most of the operating leases contain renewal options. total expense for all operating leases was $22.9 million, $25.9 million, and $23.9
future minimum lease payments (including interest) under non-cancelable operating leases and aggregate debt maturities at december 31, 2014 were as follows (in millions):

10. fair value measurements the consolidated financial statements include financial instruments for which the fair market value of such instruments may differ from amounts reflected on a historical cost basis. financial instruments of the company consist of cash deposits, accounts and other receivables, investments, accounts payable, certain accrued liabilities, and borrowings under the credit agreement. the carrying value of these financial instruments generally approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. financial instruments also include notes payable. see note
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. the company prioritizes the inputs used to determine fair values in one of the following three categories:
level 1quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable, either directly or indirectly.
in such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis the following table summarizes the company's financial instruments which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):
corporate debt securities                                   103.2                     103.2

cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments the company estimates the fair values of its money market funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. the company estimates the fair values of its commercial paper, u.s. government and agency securities, asset-backed securities, and corporate debt securities by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. the pricing services use industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. these inputs include reported trades and broker-dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, benchmark yields, credit spreads, prepayment and default projections based on historical data, and other observable inputs. the company independently reviews and validates the pricing received from the third-party pricing service by comparing the prices to prices reported by a secondary pricing source. the company's validation procedures have not resulted in an adjustment to the pricing received from the pricing service.
investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long-term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development. certain of the company's investments in unconsolidated affiliates are designated as available-for-
deferred compensation plan the company holds investments in trading securities related to its executive deferred compensation plan. the investments are in a variety of stock and bond mutual funds. the fair values of these investments and the corresponding liabilities are based on quoted market prices.
derivative instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures, and interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposures. all derivatives contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. the fair value of foreign currency derivative financial instruments was estimated based on quoted market foreign exchange rates and market discount rates as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis reflecting the contractual terms of the agreements and the 6-month libor forward interest rate curve. judgment was employed in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value; accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the company could realize in a current market exchange. the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
11. derivative instruments and hedging activities the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its currency exchange rate risk and its interest rate risk as summarized below. notional amounts are stated in united states dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the respective dates. the company does not enter into these arrangements for trading or speculation purposes.

into net periodic benefits cost in 2015 are expected to be $1.1 million and $(0.4) million, respectively.
expected long-term returns for each of the plans' strategic asset classes were developed through consultation with investment advisors. several factors were considered, including survey of investment managers' expectations, current market data, minimum guaranteed returns in certain insurance contracts, and historical market returns over long periods. using policy target allocation percentages and the asset class expected returns, a weighted-average expected return was calculated.
to select the discount rates for the defined benefit pension plans, the company uses a modeling process that involves matching the expected duration of its benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of aa-

plan assets the company's investment strategy for plan assets is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk and to earn performance rates of return in accordance with the benchmarks adopted for each asset class. risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets.
the administrative and investment committee decides on the defined benefit plan provider in each location and that provider decides the target allocation for the company's defined benefit plan at that location. the target asset allocation selected reflects a risk/return profile the company feels is appropriate relative to the plans'
liability structure and return goals. in certain plans, asset allocations may be governed by local requirements.

equity and debt securities are valued at fair value based on quoted market prices reported on the active markets on which the individual securities are traded. the insurance contracts are valued at the cash surrender value of the contracts, which is deemed to approximate its fair value.
the following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, at december 31, 2014, are expected to be paid (in millions):
defined contribution plans the company's employees in the united states and puerto rico are eligible to participate in a qualified 401(k) and
1165(e) plan, respectively. in the united states, participants may contribute up to 25% of their eligible compensation (subject to tax code limitation) to the plan. edwards lifesciences matches the first 3% of the participant's annual eligible compensation contributed to the plan on a dollar-for-dollar basis. edwards lifesciences matches the next 2% of the participant's annual eligible compensation to the plan on a 50% basis. in puerto rico, participants may contribute up to 25% of their annual compensation (subject to tax code limitation) to the plan. edwards lifesciences matches the first 4% of participant's annual eligible compensation contributed to the plan on a 50% basis. the company also provides a 2% profit sharing contribution calculated on eligible earnings for each employee. matching contributions relating to edwards lifesciences employees were $12.8 million, $12.0
the company also has nonqualified deferred compensation plans for a select group of employees. the plans provide eligible participants the opportunity to defer eligible compensation to future dates specified by the participant with a return based on investment alternatives selected by the participant. the amount accrued under these nonqualified plans was $28.7 million and $25.9 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
$750.0 million of the company's common stock from time to time until december 31, 2016. in july 2014, the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program providing for an additional $750.0 million of repurchases without a specified end date. stock repurchased under these programs will be used to offset obligations under the company's employee stock option programs and reduce the total shares outstanding.
acquired to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. the timing and size of any future stock repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions, stock prices, and other cash requirements.

the asr agreements were accounted for as two separate transactions: (a) the value of the initial delivery of shares was recorded as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction on the acquisition date and (b) the remaining amount of the purchase price paid was recorded as a forward contract indexed to the company's own common stock and was recorded in "additional paid-in capital" on the consolidated balance sheets. the initial delivery of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share. the company determined that the forward contract indexed to the company's common stock met all the applicable criteria for equity classification and, therefore, was not accounted for as a derivative instrument.
employee and director stock plans the edwards lifesciences corporation long-term stock incentive compensation program (the "program") provides for the grant of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units for eligible employees and contractors of the company. under the program, these grants are awarded at a price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant based upon the closing price on that date. options to purchase shares of the company's common stock granted under the program generally vest over predetermined periods of between three to four years and expire seven years after the date of grant. restricted stock units of the company's common stock granted under the program generally vest over predetermined periods ranging from three to five years after the date of grant. market-based restricted stock units of the company's common stock granted under the program vest based on a combination of certain service and market conditions. the actual number of shares issued will be determined based on the company's total shareholder return relative to a selected industry peer group over a three-year performance period, and may range from 0% to 175% of the targeted number of shares granted. on may 8, 2014, an amendment and restatement of the program was approved by the company's stockholders. under the amended program, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the program was 50.9 million shares. no more than 4.6 million shares reserved for issuance may be granted in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units.
20,000 stock options or 8,000 restricted stock units of the company's common stock, or a combination thereof, provided that in no event may the total value of the combined annual award exceed $0.2 million. each option and restricted stock unit award granted in 2011 or prior generally vests in three equal annual installments. each option and restricted stock unit award granted after 2011 generally vests after one year. additionally, each nonemployee director may elect to receive all or a portion of the annual cash retainer to which the director is otherwise entitled through the issuance of stock options or restricted shares. each option received as a deferral of the cash retainer immediately vests on the grant date, and each restricted share award vests after one year.
upon a director's initial election to the board, the director receives an initial grant of stock options equal to a fair market value on grant date of $0.2 million, not to exceed 10,000 shares. these grants vest over three years from the date of grant. under the nonemployee directors program, an aggregate of 1.4 million shares of the company's common stock has been authorized for issuance.
the company has an employee stock purchase plan for united states employees and a plan for international employees
of the lower of the fair market value of edwards lifesciences common stock on the effective date of subscription or the date of purchase. under the espp, employees can authorize the company to withhold up to 12% of their compensation for common stock purchases, subject to certain limitations. the espp is available to all active employees of the company paid from the united states payroll and to eligible employees of the company outside the united states, to the extent permitted by local law. the espp for united states employees is qualified under section 423 of the internal revenue code. the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the espp was 6.9 million shares.
expected volatility is estimated based on a blend of the weighted-average of the historical volatility of edwards lifesciences' stock and the implied volatility from traded options on edwards lifesciences' stock. the expected term of awards granted is estimated from the vesting period of the award, as well as historical exercise behavior, and represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding. the company uses historical data to estimate forfeitures and has estimated an annual forfeiture rate of 5.4%.
the black-scholes option pricing model was used with the following weighted-average assumptions for options granted during the following periods:
expected dividend yield                none         none         none expected volatility                      31  %        31  %        31  %
the black-scholes option pricing model was used with the following weighted-average assumptions for espp subscriptions granted during the following periods:
expected dividend yield                none         none         none expected volatility                      30  %        33  %        33  %
the fair value of market-based restricted stock units was determined using a monte carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. the weighted-average assumptions used to determine the fair value of the market-based restricted stock units during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 included a risk-free interest rate of 0.9%, 0.4%, and 0.3%, respectively, and an expected volatility rate of 31.7%, 33.4%, and 30.4%, respectively.
stock option activity during the year ended december 31, 2014 under the program and the nonemployee directors program was as follows (in millions, except years and per-share amounts):
options forfeited                          (0.3  )         78.20
the following table summarizes nonvested restricted stock unit activity during the year ended december 31, 2014
(a) includes 39,000 shares of market-based restricted stock units granted during 2014, which represents the targeted number of shares to be issued. as described above, the actual number of shares ultimately issued will be determined based on the company's total shareholder return relative to a selected industry peer group.
the intrinsic value of stock options exercised and restricted stock units vested during the years ended december
31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were $158.8 million, $73.9 million, and $252.8 million, respectively. the intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the amount by which the market price of the company's common stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, the company received cash from exercises of stock options of $93.2 million, $26.3 million, and $80.5 million, respectively, and realized tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units of $51.9 million, $24.7 million, and
as of december 31, 2014, the total remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions amounted to

during 2014, net deferred tax assets increased $41.9 million, including items that were recorded to stockholders'
equity and which did not impact the company's income tax provision.
the valuation allowance of $47.7 million as of december 31, 2014 reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. this allowance primarily relates to the net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards of certain united states and non-united states subsidiaries, and to the deferred tax assets established for impairment losses on certain investments and for certain non-united states credit carryforwards.
a valuation allowance of $2.6 million has been provided for other-than-temporary impairments and unrealized losses related to certain investments that may not be recognized due to the uncertainty of the ready marketability of certain impaired investments.

california research expenditure tax    $          52.5    $                $     52.5      indefinite credits puerto rico purchases credit                      13.0       (13.0      )                  indefinite total                                  $          65.5    $  (13.0      )  $     52.5
the company has $52.5 million of california research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods.
the credits may be carried forward indefinitely. based upon anticipated future taxable income, the company expects that it is more likely than not that all california research expenditure tax credits will be utilized, although the utilization of the full benefit is expected to occur over a number of years and into the far distant future.
the united states state net operating loss carryforwards include $2.7 million of losses attributable to windfall stock option deductions. a net benefit of $0.2 million will be recorded to "additional paid-in capital" when realized as a reduction to income taxes payable.
approximately $7.7 million of the total $52.5 million california research expenditure tax credit carryforwards are attributable to windfall stock option deductions and will be recorded as a benefit to "additional paid-in capital"
deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain of the company's foreign subsidiaries of approximately $1,652.8 million as of december 31, 2014 since these amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. it is not practicable to calculate the deferred taxes associated with these earnings because of the variability of multiple factors that would need to be assessed at the time of any assumed repatriation; however, foreign tax credits would likely be available to reduce federal income taxes in the event of distribution. in making this assertion, the company evaluates, among other factors, the profitability of its united states and foreign operations and the need for cash within and outside the united states, including cash requirements for capital improvement, acquisitions, market expansion, and stock repurchase programs. the company does not expect any earnings for certain of its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and records the tax impact in net income currently.
the company has received tax incentives in puerto rico, the dominican republic, singapore, and switzerland. the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 by $0.63, $0.44, and $0.39,
respectively. the puerto rico, dominican republic, singapore and switzerland grants provide the company's manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028, 2030 (subject to review beginning in 2015), 2024, and 2015, respectively.
a reconciliation of the united states federal statutory income tax rate to the company's effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):
tax benefit tax credits, federal and state                                   (13.5  )     (19.8  )      (4.9  )

the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 included (1) $262.1 million of tax expense associated with a $750.0 million litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 (see note 4) and
(2) $4.8 million of tax benefits from the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions.
the federal research credit expired on december 31, 2011 and was reinstated on january 2, 2013. as a result, the effective income tax rates for the year ended december 31, 2012 was calculated without a benefit for the federal research credit. the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 included (1) an $8.4 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and (2) $31.3 million of tax expense associated with the
$83.6 million litigation award received from medtronic in february 2013 (see note 4).
reserve for uncertain tax positions as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $192.3
million and $127.7 million, respectively. the company estimates that these liabilities would be reduced by $34.3
million and $30.9 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments. the net amounts of $158.0
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties, and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
unrecognized tax benefits, january 1      $         127.7     $  113.6     $   78.0
current year tax positions                           75.9         17.8         41.7

unrecognized tax benefits, december 31    $         192.3     $  127.7     $  113.6
the company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. as of december 31, 2014, the company had accrued $6.8 million (net of $5.0 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of december 31, 2013, the company had accrued $4.5 million (net of $3.3 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions. during 2014, 2013, and 2012, the company recognized interest expense, net of tax benefit, of $2.3 million, $1.4 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, in "provision for income taxes" on the consolidated statements of operations.
the company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. while the company has accrued for matters it believes are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. furthermore, the company may later decide to challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise its right to appeal. the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law. management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
at december 31, 2014, all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008. during the third quarter of 2013, the internal revenue service ("irs") completed its fieldwork for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. the case is currently in suspense pending finalization of an advance pricing agreement
("apa") and joint committee of taxation approval. the irs began its examination of the 2011 and 2012 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2013.
the company has entered into an apa process between the switzerland and the united states governments for the years
during 2014, the company also filed with the irs a request for a pre-filing agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 (see note 4).
management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions. based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, the company cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in its existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus has recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability. however, if the apa and/or pre-filing agreement is finalized in the next 12
months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in the company's uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.
17. legal proceedings edwards lifesciences is or may be a party to, or may otherwise be responsible for, pending or threatened lawsuits related primarily to products and services currently or formerly manufactured or performed, as applicable, by edwards lifesciences. such cases and claims raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. upon resolution of any such legal matter or other claim, edwards lifesciences may incur charges in excess of established reserves. the company is not able to estimate the amount or range of any loss for legal contingencies for which there is no reserve or additional loss for matters already reserved. while any such charge related to matters could have a material adverse impact on edwards lifesciences' net income or cash flows in the period in which it is recorded or paid, management does not believe that any such charge relating to any currently pending lawsuit would have a material adverse effect on edwards lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
edwards lifesciences is subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside of the united states. the operations of edwards lifesciences, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. while it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of continuing compliance with environmental protection laws, management believes that such compliance will not have a material impact on edwards lifesciences' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
18. segment information edwards lifesciences conducts operations worldwide and is managed in the following geographical regions: united states, europe, japan, and rest of world. all regions sell products that are used to treat advanced cardiovascular disease.
the company's geographic segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the chief operating decision maker (the chief executive officer). the company evaluates the performance of its geographic segments based on net sales and income before provision for income taxes ("pre-tax income"). the accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in note 2. segment net sales and segment pre-tax income are based on internally derived standard foreign exchange rates, which may differ from year to year, and do not include inter-segment profits. because of the interdependence of the reportable segments, the operating profit as presented may not be representative of the geographical distribution that would occur if the segments were not interdependent. net sales by geographic area are based on the location of the customer.
certain items are maintained at the corporate level and are not allocated to the segments. the non-allocated items include net interest expense, global marketing expenses, corporate research and
development expenses, manufacturing variances, corporate headquarters costs, special gains and charges, stock-based compensation, foreign currency hedging activities, certain litigation costs, and most of the company's amortization expense. although most of the company's depreciation expense is included in segment pre-tax income, due to the company's methodology for cost build-up, it is impractical to determine the amount of depreciation expense included in each segment, and, therefore, a portion is maintained at the corporate level. the company neither discretely allocates assets to its operating segments, nor evaluates the operating segments using discrete asset information.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the three years ended december 31, 2014. also discussed is our financial position as of december 31, 2014. you should read this discussion in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
overview we are the global leader in the science of heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring. driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with clinicians to develop innovative technologies in the areas of structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, enabling them to save and enhance lives. we conduct operations worldwide and are managed in the following geographical regions: united states, europe, japan, and rest of world. our products are categorized into the following main areas: transcatheter heart valve therapy, surgical heart valve therapy, and critical care.
effective january 1, 2014, we changed our method of accounting for certain intellectual property litigation expenses related to the defense and enforcement of our issued patents. under the new method of accounting, these legal costs are expensed in the period incurred; previously, these costs were capitalized and
gross profit as a percentage of net sales          73.1   %          74.7   %          74.2   %        (1.6   ) pts.       0.5   pts.
our sales growth was driven by our transcatheter heart valve therapy products which, in europe, benefited from the launch of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve, and in the united states, benefited from the launch of the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve. our gross profit margin was negatively impacted in 2014 by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased incentive compensation due to our strong performance, and higher manufacturing costs, primarily for our operations in utah. net income in 2014 and 2013 benefited from special items. in 2014, we received $750.0 million ($487.9 million, net of tax) from medtronic, inc. ("medtronic") for an upfront payment due under a litigation settlement agreement, and in 2013, we received from medtronic an $83.6 million ($52.3 million, net of tax) litigation award.
healthcare environment, opportunities and challenges the medical device industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve. our success is measured both by the development of innovative products and the value we bring to our stakeholders. we are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, and we are committed to defending our intellectual property. to strengthen our leadership and enable future growth opportunities, in 2014 we invested 14.9% of our net sales in research and development. in a consolidating industry, we believe our focus on innovation and a robust product pipeline will continue to help us compete more effectively, sustain our successes, and build long-term value for our shareholders. the following is a summary of important developments during 2014:
 early clinical outcomes in the edwards sapien 3 trial demonstrated outstanding safety, including a low mortality and stroke rate;
 longer-term updates from the partner trial strengthened the evidence that patients treated with the sapien valve demonstrated a mortality benefit, persistent symptom benefit, and a statistically significant reduction in re-hospitalizations compared with standard therapy;
 we received regulatory approval in the united states for our edwards sapien xt valve, and we continued to evaluate the sapien 3 valve as part of the partner ii trial; and
 we received regulatory approval in europe for the edwards intuity elite valve system, and in the united states, this valve platform has been studied as part of the transform trial. three-year clinical outcomes of the edwards intuity valve platform studied in the triton trial demonstrated improved cardiac and valvular performance, as well as patient functional status.
we are dedicated to generating robust clinical and economic evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the new healthcare environment, with the goal of enhancing the value of delivering comprehensive care.
united states         $1,047.3             $939.6               $812.1               $107.7          $127.5            11.5      %   15.7         %
the $107.7 million increase in net sales in the united states in 2014 was due primarily to:
 transcatheter heart valve therapy, which increased net sales by $85.1 million, due primarily to (1) commercial sales of the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve resulting from the product launch in june 2014, (2) an increase in clinical sales of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve, (3) royalties received under a license agreement with medtronic (see note 4 to the
 critical care, which increased net sales by $12.9 million, due primarily to enhanced surgical recovery products; and
 surgical heart valve therapy, which increased net sales by $25.9 million, driven primarily by sales of pericardial aortic tissue valves and edwards intuity elite valves; and
 critical care, which increased net sales by $16.1 million, driven primarily by core hemodynamic products and enhanced surgical recovery products;
 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $23.0 million, due to the weakening of various currencies against the united states dollar, mainly the japanese yen, partially offset by the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar.
the $127.5 million increase in net sales in the united states in 2013 was due primarily to:
 surgical heart valve products, which increased net sales by $15.4 million, driven primarily by sales of pericardial mitral tissue valves and edwards intuity elite valves;
 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $43.9 million, due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar, partially offset by the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar.
the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net sales is not necessarily indicative of the impact on net income due to the corresponding effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on international manufacturing and operating costs, and our hedging activities. for more information see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
critical care                           553.2             536.6             560.0             16.6                  (23.4   )   3.1       %        (4.2   )%
 the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve, driven primarily by the launch in europe and clinical sales in the united states; and
 the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve, driven primarily by the launches in the united states and japan;
 lower sales of the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve, primarily in the united states, and the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve in europe, as customers converted to next-generation products.
 the edwards sapien transcatheter heart valve in the united states, which increased net sales by $97.2 million;
 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which increased net sales by $5.2 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar;
 a $14.1 million sales reserve for estimated transcatheter heart valve therapy product returns expected in 2014 upon introduction of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter valve system in europe and the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve in the united states.
during the first quarter of 2014, we completed enrollment in the 500 patient cohort of the partner ii trial studying the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter valve system in high risk and inoperable patients. in january 2014, we received fda approval to expand the partner ii trial to include a 1,000 patient single-arm, non-randomized cohort to study the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter valve system in the treatment of intermediate-risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. enrollment was completed in september 2014. at the end of 2014, we submitted our pre-market approval application for sapien 3 in the united states.
in january 2014, we received ce mark for the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter valve system in europe. in june 2014, we received fda approval for the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve in the united states for the treatment of high-risk and inoperable patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
 surgical heart valve products, which increased net sales by $36.4 million, driven by sales in the united states and europe of pericardial aortic tissue valves and edwards intuity elite valves;
 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $10.5 million, due to the weakening of various currencies against the united states dollar, mainly the japanese yen, partially offset by the strengthening of the euro against the united states dollar.
 surgical heart valve products, which increased net sales by $30.1 million, driven by sales of pericardial aortic and mitral tissue valves, and edwards intuity elite valves;
 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $20.2 million, due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar.
in april 2014, we received ce mark for our advanced edwards intuity elite valve system. this next-generation, rapid deployment system facilitates smaller incisions in surgical aortic valve replacement procedures. in the united states, we completed enrollment of patients in our transform trial for edwards intuity elite, and we continued enrolling patients in our commence clinical trial, which is studying our next-generation glx advanced tissue platform applied to the magna ease aortic surgical valve and the magna mitral ease valve.
critical care the $16.6 million increase in net sales of critical care products in 2014 was due primarily to enhanced surgical recovery products, and core hemodynamic products outside the united states, partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $12.0 million, due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar.
the $23.4 million decrease in net sales of critical care products in 2013 was due primarily to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which decreased net sales by $28.9 million, due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar.
in june 2014, we received fda clearance for the clearsight system, a noninvasive monitor that provides clinicians access to blood volume and blood flow information for patients at moderate or high risk of post-surgical complications, in whom invasive monitoring would not be used. the  clearsight system is part of our enhanced surgical recovery product portfolio. in september 2014, due to a strategic shift of our investment initiatives, we decided to discontinue our automated glucose monitoring program.
gross profit
gross profit as a percentage of net sales      73.1   %      74.7   %      74.2   %   (1.6   ) pts.     0.5   pts.
the 1.6 percentage point decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2014 was driven by:
 a 0.8 percentage point increase due to an improved product mix in the united states, driven by transcatheter heart valve therapy products.
the 0.5 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2013 was driven by:
 a 1.0 percentage point increase due to an improved product mix in the united states, driven by transcatheter heart valve therapy products; and
 a 0.5 percentage point increase in international markets due to a more profitable product mix, primarily higher sales of transcatheter heart valve therapy products;
 a 1.3 percentage point decrease due primarily to higher manufacturing costs due to capacity expansion in preparation for multiple transcatheter heart valve therapy product introductions.
the $124.6 million increase in sg&a expenses in 2014 was due primarily to (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in the united states, europe, and japan, mainly to support the transcatheter heart valve therapy program, and (2) higher performance-based incentive compensation.
the $36.0 million increase in sg&a expenses in 2013 was due primarily to (1) higher sales and marketing expenses in the united states and japan, mainly to support the transcatheter heart valve therapy program and (2) the 2.3% united states medical device excise tax, or $15.8 million, which became effective in 2013. these increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency, which reduced expenses by $12.4 million due primarily to the weakening of the japanese yen against the united states dollar. the decrease in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2013 was due primarily to decreased sg&a expenses in europe as a percentage of net sales.
the increase in research and development expenses in 2014 was due primarily to new aortic and mitral transcatheter heart valve therapy product development efforts, additional investments in clinical studies in the surgical heart valve therapy program, and higher performance-based incentive compensation. the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to higher net sales.
the increase in research and development expenses in 2013 was due primarily to additional investments in clinical studies and new product development efforts in the transcatheter heart valve therapy program.
intellectual property litigation (income) expense, net in may 2014, we entered into an agreement with medtronic to settle all outstanding patent litigation between the companies, including all cases related to transcatheter heart valves. pursuant to the agreement, we received an upfront payment from medtronic in the amount of $750.0 million. for further information, see note 4 to the "consolidated financial statements."
in february 2013, we received $83.6 million from medtronic in satisfaction of the initial april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the united states andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, including accrued interest.
we incurred external legal costs related to intellectual property litigation of $9.6 million, $22.1 million, and $14.4 million during 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
special charges special charges were $70.7 million, $16.3 million, and $16.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. for additional details, see note 5 to the "consolidated financial statements."
in december 2014, we recorded a $4.0 million impairment charge related to our promissory note receivable because it was likely that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the promissory note agreement.
the loss on investments primarily represents our net share of gains and losses in investments accounted for under the equity method, and realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale and cost method investments. during 2014, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $3.5 million related to one of our cost method investments.
in september 2014, we committed to purchase our draper, utah facility for $17.0 million under a purchase option provided in the lease agreement. under the terms of the lease agreement, we paid $1.0 million in december 2014 for certain lease contract termination costs.
state and local taxes, net of federal tax benefit                    19.3                      5.8               3.7
tax credits, federal and state                                             (13.5   )         (19.8   )          (4.9   )
release of reserve for uncertain tax positions for prior years              (4.8   )          (3.9   )          (0.8   )
u.s. tax on foreign earnings, net of credits                                (3.1   )          18.9               0.7
reserve for uncertain tax positions as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $192.3 million and $127.7 million, respectively. we estimate that these liabilities would be reduced by $34.3 million and $30.9 million, respectively, from offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, state income taxes, and timing adjustments. the net amounts of $158.0 million and $96.8 million, respectively, if not required, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, penalties, and foreign exchange, is as follows (in millions):
unrecognized tax benefits, january 1         $127.7            $113.6           $78.0
current year tax positions                   75.9              17.8             41.7
increase prior year tax positions            0.6               5.7              2.6
decrease prior year tax positions                  (10.5   )         (9.0   )         (4.3   )
lapse of statutes of limitations                    (0.4   )         (0.3   )         (0.1   )
unrecognized tax benefits, december 31       $192.3            $127.7           $113.6
we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. as of december 31, 2014, we had accrued $6.8 million (net of $5.0 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions, and as of december 31, 2013, we had accrued $4.5 million (net of $3.3 million tax benefit) of interest related to uncertain tax positions. during 2014, 2013, and 2012, we recognized interest expense, net of tax benefit, of $2.3 million, $1.4 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, in "provision for income taxes" on the consolidated statements of operations.
we strive to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time. while we have accrued for matters we believe are more likely than not to require settlement, the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements. furthermore, we may later decide to
challenge any assessments, if made, and may exercise our right to appeal. the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, proposed assessments by tax authorities, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law. management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions.
at december 31, 2014, all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008. during the third quarter of 2013, the internal revenue service ("irs") completed its fieldwork for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. the case is currently in suspense pending finalization of an advance pricing agreement ("apa") and joint committee of taxation approval. the irs began its examination of the 2011 and 2012 tax years during the fourth quarter of 2013.
we have also entered into an apa process between the switzerland and the united states governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters. these transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain.
during 2014, we also filed with the irs a request for a pre-filing agreement associated with a tax return filing position on a portion of the litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 (see note 4 to the "consolidated financial statements").
management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions. based upon the information currently available and numerous possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate what, if any, changes in our existing uncertain tax positions may occur in the next 12 months and thus have recorded the gross uncertain tax positions as a long-term liability. however, if the apa and/or pre-filing agreement is finalized in the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that these events could result in a significant change in our uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 included (1) $262.1 million of tax expense associated with a $750.0 million litigation settlement payment received from medtronic in may 2014 (see note 4 to the "consolidated financial statements") and (2) $4.8 million of tax benefits from the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions.
the federal research credit expired on december 31, 2011 and was reinstated on january 2, 2013. as a result, the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2012 was calculated without a benefit for the federal research credit. the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 included (1) an $8.4 million benefit for the full year 2012 federal research credit and (2) $31.3 million of tax expense associated with the $83.6 million litigation award received from medtronic in february 2013 (see note 4 to the "consolidated financial statements").
we have received tax incentives in puerto rico, the dominican republic, singapore, and switzerland. the tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rates favorably impacted earnings per diluted share for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 by $0.63, $0.44, and $0.39, respectively. the puerto rico, dominican republic, singapore, and switzerland grants provide our manufacturing operations partial or full exemption from local taxes until the years 2028, 2030 (subject to review beginning in 2015), 2024, and 2015, respectively.
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, amounts available under credit facilities, and cash from operations. we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital, capital expenditures, and other financial commitments for the next twelve months. however, we periodically consider various financing alternatives and may, from time to
time, seek to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. we believe that we have the financial flexibility to attract long-term capital to fund short-term and long-term growth objectives. however, no assurances can be given that such long-term capital will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.
we believe that cash held in the united states, in addition to amounts available under credit facilities and cash from operations, are sufficient to fund our united states operating requirements for the next twelve months. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the united states have historically been used to fund international operations and acquire businesses outside of the united states, although a portion of those amounts may, from time to time, be subject to temporary intercompany loans into the united states. as of december 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in the united states and outside the united states were $651.7 million and $787.1 million, respectively. the majority of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the united states relates to undistributed earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, which are considered by us to be indefinitely reinvested. repatriations of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the united states are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions, and may be subject to withholding and other taxes. the potential tax liability related to any repatriation would be dependent on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time such repatriation is made and the complexities of the tax laws of the united states and the respective foreign jurisdictions.
we have a five-year credit agreement ("the credit agreement") which provides up to an aggregate of $750.0 million in borrowings in multiple currencies. as of december 31, 2014, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement. in october 2013, we issued $600.0 million of 2.875% fixed-rate unsecured senior notes due october 15, 2018. for further information on our long-term debt, see note 9 to the "consolidated financial statements."
from time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors. we consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, expected dilution from stock plans, cash capacity, and the market price of our common stock. during 2014, we repurchased a total of 4.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $300.0 million, and as of december 31, 2014, had remaining authority to purchase $952.5 million of our common stock. for further information, see note 13 to the "consolidated financial statements."
net cash flows provided by operating activities of $1,022.3 million for 2014 increased $549.6 million from 2013 due primarily to (1) the $750.0 million upfront payment received from medtronic under a litigation settlement agreement, (2) a lower bonus payout in 2014 associated with 2013 bonuses, and (3) improved operating performance. these increases were partially offset by (1) income tax payments of $224.5 million related to the medtronic settlement, (2) the prior year receipt of $83.6 million from medtronic in satisfaction of the initial april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the united states andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, and (3) the $50.0 million charitable contribution to the edwards lifesciences foundation in 2014.
net cash flows provided by operating activities of $472.7 million for 2013 increased $110.6 million from 2012 due primarily to (1) the receipt of $83.6 million from medtronic, inc. in satisfaction of the april 2010 jury award of damages for infringement of the u.s. andersen transcatheter heart valve patent, (2) increased collection of accounts receivable, and (3) improved operating performance. these increases were partially offset by (1) a $22.7 million increase in inventory purchases to support future product launches and (2) a $17.0 million impact from excess tax benefits from stock plans, primarily as a result of the realization of excess tax benefits that had been previously unrealized due to credit carryforwards and net operating losses in the united states in 2011 and 2012.
net cash used in investing activities of $633.0 million in 2014 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $527.4 million and capital expenditures of $82.9 million.
net cash used in investing activities of $412.7 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $300.9 million and capital expenditures of $109.0 million.
net cash used in financing activities of $153.0 million in 2014 consisted primarily of purchases of treasury stock of $300.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from stock plans of $113.3 million, and the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $49.4 million (including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits).
net cash provided by financing activities of $34.9 million in 2013 consisted primarily of net proceeds from debt of $409.6 million, the excess tax benefit from stock plans of $73.5 million (including the realization of previously unrealized excess tax benefits), and proceeds from stock plans of $45.5 million, partially offset by repurchases of common stock of $496.9 million.
a summary of all of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2014 were as follows (in millions):
capital commitment obligations(b)                 3.1       0.8           2.3                               
purchase and other commitments                    3.7       2.6           1.1                               
the amount included in "less than 1 year" reflects anticipated contributions to our various pension plans. anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable. the total accrued benefit liability for our pension plans recognized as of december 31, 2014 was $49.3 million. this amount is impacted by, among other items, pension expense funding levels, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and investment return on plan assets. therefore, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table. see note 12 to the "consolidated financial statements" for further information.
capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that we are obligated to pay to our limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees. these investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies, and it is not certain if and/or when these payments will be made.
as of december 31, 2014, the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was $204.1 million. we have entered into an apa process between the switzerland and the united states governments for the years 2009 through 2015 covering transfer pricing matters. these transfer pricing matters are significant to our consolidated financial statements, and the final outcome of the negotiations between the two governments is uncertain. management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result for our uncertain tax positions. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid, and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table.
contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events. in situations where we have no ability to influence the achievement of the milestone or otherwise avoid the payment, we have included those payments in the table above. however, we have excluded from the table contingent milestone payments and other contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments or for which we can avoid making payment by unilaterally deciding to stop development of a product or cease progress of a clinical trial. we estimate that these contingent payments could be up to approximately
critical accounting policies and estimates our results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of our accounting policies, as discussed in the notes to the "consolidated financial statements." certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). in evaluating our transactions, management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions.
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates. these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements, using historical experience and all available information. we also use outside experts where appropriate. we apply estimation methodologies consistently from year to year.
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management.
revenue recognition when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, we record an estimate of various sales returns and allowances which reduces product sales and accounts receivable. these adjustments include estimates for rebates, returns, and other sales allowances. these provisions are estimated based upon historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels, and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers. product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt. if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be impacted.
in addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. for these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, and variation in product utilization all affect the estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.
our sales adjustment related to distributor rebates given to our united states distributors represents the difference between our sales price to the distributor (at our distributor "list price") and the negotiated price to be paid by the end-customer. we validate the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from our distributors or an estimate of the distributor's inventory. this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates. we periodically monitor current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the credit for future distributor rebates is fairly stated.
excess and obsolete inventory the valuation of our inventory requires us to estimate excess, obsolete, and expired inventory. we base our provisions for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory on our estimates of forecasted net sales. a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional allowances for excess, obsolete, and expired inventory in the future. in addition, our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls, increasing levels of consigned inventory, and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, obsolete, and expired inventory.
intangible assets and long-lived assets we acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset purchases. the acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value, which is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. the determination of fair value requires significant estimates, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows, the assessment of the asset's life cycle, including the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to ipr&d acquired in business combinations, are reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. additionally, management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable. the impairment reviews require significant estimates about fair value, including estimation of future cash flows, selection of an appropriate discount rate, and estimates of long-term growth rates.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amongst various tax jurisdictions. we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, including estimating the ultimate resolution to intercompany pricing controversies between countries when there are numerous possible outcomes. we review these tax uncertainties quarterly and adjust the liability as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes, such as the progress of tax audits, lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, negotiations between tax authorities, identification of new issues, and issuance of new legislation, regulations, or case law.
for additional details on our income taxes, see note 2 and note 16 to the "consolidated financial statements."
stock-based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on estimated fair values. stock-based awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units, market-based restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase subscriptions. the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes option valuation model. the fair value of market-based restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements. the black-scholes and monte carlo models require various highly judgmental assumptions, including stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected option term. stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures. judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

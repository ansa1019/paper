item 1a. risk factors for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following:
changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses.
a decline in economic activity in the u.s. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. the most recent decline in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchase of and prices for advertising on our broadcast and cable networks and owned stations, performance of our home entertainment releases, and purchases of company-branded consumer products, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. a decline in economic conditions could also reduce attendance at our parks and resorts, prices that mvpds pay for our cable programming or subscription levels for our cable programming. recent instability in european economies has had similar impacts on some of our european operations. economic conditions can also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-u.s. markets, or reduce the u.s. dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets, and economic or political conditions in a country could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.
changes in public and consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.
our businesses create entertainment, travel or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, online material, electronic games, theme park attractions, hotels and other resort facilities and travel experiences and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments in the delivery of content. many of our businesses increasingly depend on acceptance of our offerings and products by consumers outside the u.s., and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the u.s. moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, electronic games, theme park attractions, cruise ships or hotels and other resort facilities before we learn the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming and online services, from theatrical film receipts or home entertainment or electronic game sales, from theme park admissions, hotel room charges and merchandise, food and beverage sales, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products and services may decline or fail to grow to the extent we anticipate when making investment decisions and thereby adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses.
table of contents changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products or the cost of producing or distributing products.
the media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. new technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. this trend has disrupted and challenged the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content and the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming. in order to respond to these developments, we may be required to alter our business models and there can be no assurance that we will successfully respond to these changes, that we will not experience disruption as we develop responses to the changes, or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models. as a result, the income from our entertainment offerings may decline or increase at slower rates than our historical experience or our expectations when we make investments in products.
the success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the entertainment products and services we create.
the value to us of our intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of our rights as defined by applicable laws in the u.s. and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed. if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of our rights, or if existing laws are changed, our ability to generate revenue from our intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase.
the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. new technologies such as the convergence of computing, communication, and entertainment devices, the falling prices of devices incorporating such technologies, increased broadband internet speed and penetration and increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission have made the unauthorized digital copying and distribution of our films, television productions and other creative works easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. the unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry generally continues to be a significant challenge for intellectual property rights holders. inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the company's operations worldwide, despite the company's efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use and present the risk of increased losses of revenue as a result of unlicensed distribution of our content.
with respect to intellectual property developed by the company and rights acquired by the company from others, the company is subject to the risk of challenges to our copyright, trademark and patent rights by third parties. successful challenges to our rights in intellectual property may result in increased costs for obtaining rights or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights.
protection of electronically stored data is costly and if our data is compromised in spite of this protection, we may incur additional costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation.
we maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. we develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. while we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. if our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and, as described above, we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. if personal information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we may incur costs to remediate possible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of the incident.
table of contents a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide our products and services or increase the cost of providing our products and services.
demand for our products and services, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in the u.s., globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term change, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes); health concerns; international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events and others, such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks, intrusions or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. in addition, we derive royalties from the sales of our licensed goods and services by third parties and the management of businesses operated under brands licensed from the company, and we are therefore dependent on the successes of those third parties for that portion of our revenue. a wide variety of factors could influence the success of those third parties and if negative factors significantly impacted a sufficient number of our licensees, that could adversely affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses. we obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, generally including physical damage to our property and resulting business interruption, certain injuries occurring on our property and some liabilities for alleged breach of legal responsibilities. when insurance is obtained it is subject to deductibles, exclusions, terms, conditions and limits of liability. the types and levels of coverage we obtain vary from time to time depending on our view of the likelihood of specific types and levels of loss in relation to the cost of obtaining coverage for such types and levels of loss.
changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses.
as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macroeconomic conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we also make investments in existing or new businesses, including investments in international expansion of our business and in new business lines. in recent years, such investments have included expansion and renovation of certain of our theme park attractions and investment in shanghai disney resort. some of these investments may have short-term returns that are negative or low and the ultimate business prospects of the businesses may be uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring.
turmoil in the financial markets could increase our cost of borrowing and impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments.
past disruptions in the u.s. and global credit and equity markets made it difficult for many businesses to obtain financing on acceptable terms. these conditions tended to increase the cost of borrowing and if they recur, our cost of borrowing could increase and it may be more difficult to obtain financing for our operations or investments. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies that are based, in part, on the company's performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. past disruptions in the global financial markets also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a similar decline in the financial stability of financial institutions could affect our ability to secure credit-worthy counterparties for our interest rate and foreign currency hedging programs and could affect our ability to settle existing contracts.
increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs.
we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example:
•   our broadcast and cable networks, stations and online offerings compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home entertainment products and internet usage.
•   our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, and the internet, as well as with newspapers, magazines and billboards.
•   our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.
•   our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks.
•   our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities.
•   our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.
•   our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights and market share.
•   our consumer products segment competes with other licensors, publishers and retailers of character, brand and celebrity names.
•   our interactive game operations compete with other publishers of console, online and mobile games and other types of home entertainment.
competition in each of these areas may increase as a result of technological developments and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels. increased competition may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. such competition may also reduce, or limit growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our media networks, parks and resorts admissions and room rates, and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services.
sustained increases in costs of pension and postretirement medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.
with approximately 180,000 employees, our profitability is substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and postretirement medical benefits. we may experience significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors, which are beyond our control, including increases in the cost of health care. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension expense and related assets and liabilities can be volatile and may have an unfavorable impact on our costs in some years. these macroeconomic factors as well as a decline in the fair value of pension and postretirement medical plan assets may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and postretirement medical benefits and may increase future funding requirements. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure could reduce the profitability of our businesses.
we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience) or the terms on which we distribute programming (including the breadth of distribution by a carrier) may reduce revenue from distribution of programs (or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.
changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.
our broadcast networks and television stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of u.s. and overseas regulations. these regulations include:
•   u.s. fcc regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks, and our owned television stations. see item 1 - business - media networks, federal regulation.
•   environmental protection regulations.
•   federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations.
•   regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations.
•   imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions, ownership restrictions, currency exchange controls or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas.
•   domestic and international tax laws or currency controls.
changes in any of these regulations or regulatory activities in any of these areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable.
our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by the operation of laws in those jurisdictions.
our operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate rather than u.s. law. laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the u.s., and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business and our rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under u.s. law. moreover, enforcement of laws in some overseas jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business. in addition, the business and political climate in some jurisdictions may encourage corruption, which could reduce our ability to compete successfully in those jurisdictions while remaining in compliance with local laws or united states anti-corruption laws applicable to our businesses. as a result, our ability to generate revenue and our expenses in non-u.s. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if u.s. law governed these operations.
labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.
a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products, and employees of providers of programming content (such as sports leagues) may be covered by labor agreements with their employers. in general, a labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products or providers of programming content may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs.
the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations.
each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows:
•   revenues in our media networks segment are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. in general, advertising revenues are somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year.
•   revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods.
•   revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.
•   revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the company's first fiscal quarter, and by the timing and performance of theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts.
•   revenues in our interactive segment fluctuate due to the timing and performance of video game releases, which are determined by several factors, including theatrical releases and cable programming broadcasts, competition and the timing of holiday periods. revenues from certain of our internet and mobile operations are subject to similar seasonal trends.
accordingly, if a short-term negative impact on our business occurs during a time of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year.

revenues service revenues for fiscal 2014 increased 8%, or $3.0 billion, to $40.2 billion driven by the strong worldwide theatrical performance of frozen, higher mvpd fees (affiliate fees) at espn, broadcasting and the domestic disney channels, increased average guest spending for admissions and occupancy at our domestic parks and resorts operations, higher advertising revenues at espn and an increase in merchandise licensing revenue driven by frozen and disney channel properties.
product revenues for fiscal 2014 increased 10%, or $0.8 billion, to $8.6 billion reflecting higher worldwide home entertainment revenues driven by frozen, increased guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise and higher volumes at our domestic parks and resorts operations and growth at our console games business driven by the success of disney infinity.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2014 increased 6%, or $1.3 billion, to $21.4 billion driven by higher programming costs at espn and the abc television network and an increase at our domestic parks and resorts due to mymagic+, higher volumes and labor cost inflation.
cost of products for fiscal 2014 increased 2%, or $120 million, to $5.1 billion driven by higher home entertainment unit sales, higher costs at our console games business driven by disney infinity and labor and other cost inflation and higher volumes at our domestic parks and resorts operations, partially offset by lower average home entertainment per unit costs.
selling, general, administrative and other costs increased 2%, or $200 million, to $8.6 billion primarily due to higher theatrical marketing expenses driven by more titles in wide release.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 4%, or $96 million, to $2.3 billion driven by mymagic+ at our domestic parks and resorts operations.
restructuring and impairment charges the company recorded $140 million and $214 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. charges in 2014 were primarily due to severance costs across various of our segments and radio fcc license impairments, which were determined in connection with the plan to sell radio disney stations. charges in fiscal 2013 were due to severance, contract and lease termination costs and intangible and other asset impairments. charges in each fiscal year were largely driven by organizational and cost structure initiatives across various of our businesses.

noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $3 million to $503 million driven by improved operating results at hong kong disneyland resort, partially offset by a lower noncontrolling interest impact related to espn. the decrease at espn was due to lower net income in the current year driven by after-tax gains recognized in the prior year on the sales of a joint venture interest and our espn uk business, partially offset by improved operating results.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes.
revenues for fiscal 2013 increased 7%, or $2.8 billion, to $45.0 billion; net income attributable to disney increased 8%, or $454 million, to $6.1 billion; and diluted earnings per share attributable to disney (eps) for the year increased 8% or $0.25 to $3.38. the eps increase in fiscal 2013 reflected improved operating performance and lower net interest expense driven by lower effective interest rates.
revenues service revenues for fiscal 2013 increased 8%, or $2.7 billion, to $37.3 billion driven by higher guest spending for admissions, more passenger cruise ship days, higher attendance and an increase in occupied room nights at our domestic parks and resorts operations, contractual affiliate fee growth at espn, the domestic disney channels and broadcasting, the strong theatrical performance of wreck-it ralph and oz the great and powerful and growth at our merchandise licensing business.
product revenues of $7.8 billion for fiscal 2013 were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012, as higher volumes and higher average guest spending on food, beverage and merchandise at our domestic parks and resorts operations and the success of disney infinity were largely offset by a decrease in home entertainment units sold.
costs and expenses cost of services for fiscal 2013 increased 8%, or $1.5 billion, to $20.1 billion driven by higher programming costs at espn and abc primetime, higher film cost amortization driven by more theatrical releases and an increase at domestic parks and resorts driven by new guest offerings, labor and other cost inflation and higher volumes.
cost of products of $4.9 billion for fiscal 2013 was relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012 as higher costs due to volume growth and labor and other cost inflation at our domestic parks and resorts operations and the success of disney infinity were largely offset by lower volumes at our home entertainment business.
selling, general, administrative and other costs increased 5%, or $405 million, to $8.4 billion reflected higher information technology spending driven by mymagic+ and higher marketing costs due to the fall launch of abc programming and more theatrical titles in release.
depreciation and amortization costs increased 10%, or $205 million, to $2.2 billion driven by new guest offerings at our domestic parks and resorts operations.
restructuring and impairment charges the company recorded $100 million of restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2012 primarily due to severance, lease termination costs and the write-off of an intellectual property asset. these charges were largely due to organizational and cost structure initiatives across various of our businesses.

noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year increased $9 million to $500 million due to higher net income at espn. this increase was partially offset by a higher allocation of expense to the noncontrolling interest at hong kong disneyland resort due to higher recognition of royalty and management fee expense. additionally the impact of pre-opening costs at shanghai disney resort also reduced net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

revenues games revenues grew $244 million from $812 million to $1,056 million due to increases of 24% from sales of console games and 10% from social/mobile games. the increase in sales of console games was due to the success of the disney infinity franchise, partially offset by the performance of epic mickey 2 in the prior year. the current year benefited from the launch of disney infinity 2.0 on september 23, 2014 and higher sales of disney infinity 1.0, which was launched on august 18, 2013. the increase in social/mobile games revenue was driven by performance of tsum tsum and frozen free fall, partially offset by a decrease as a result of discontinued games.
revenue from other content decreased $9 million from $252 million to $243 million primarily due to the expiration of a distribution contract in the current year and lower online advertising revenues, partially offset by an increase in revenue at our mobile phone business in japan. the increase in revenue at our mobile phone business in japan was due to higher handset sales.

(2)   per capita guest spending and per room guest spending are stated at prior-year foreign exchange rates to remove the impact of foreign currency translation. the euro to u.s. dollar weighted average foreign currency exchange rate was $1.31, $1.30 and $1.39 for fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
costs and expenses operating expenses include operating labor, which increased by $269 million from $3,825 million to $4,094 million, cost of sales, which increased by $54 million from $1,294 million to $1,348 million, and infrastructure costs, which increased by $250 million from $1,505 million to $1,755 million.  higher operating labor was due to new guest offerings and labor cost inflation. the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher volumes partially offset by a lower costs per unit mix of vacation club units, reflecting sales at the grand floridian, which is a higher margin property. the increase in infrastructure costs was driven by new guest offerings and the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds collected in 2012 related to the impact of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan on tokyo disney resort. significant new guest offerings that drove increased operating labor and infrastructure costs included a full year of operating the disney fantasy, pre-opening costs at shanghai disney resort, the expansion of disney california adventure and a full year of disney's art of animation resort at walt disney world resort.
selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $111 million from $1,849 million to $1,960 million primarily due to information technology spending related to mymagic+.
the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to new guest offerings at walt disney world resort and disney california adventure, costs associated with the refurbishment of the disney magic and a full year of depreciation for the disney fantasy.
table of contents segment operating income segment operating income increased 17%, or $318 million, to $2,220 million due to increases at our domestic parks and resorts, disney vacation club and hong kong disneyland resort, partially offset by a decrease at disneyland paris and higher pre-opening costs at shanghai disney resort.
studio entertainment operating results for the studio entertainment segment are as follows:
year ended           % changebetter /(worse)
revenues higher theatrical distribution revenues were driven by two disney feature animation releases in the current year, wreck-it ralph and planes, compared to none in the prior year. other significant titles in release were marvel's iron man 3, monsters university, oz the great and powerful, the lone ranger and lincoln in the current year compared to marvel's the avengers, brave, john carter and the muppets in the prior year.
lower home entertainment revenue reflected a 19% decrease from a decline in unit sales. the decrease in unit sales was driven by the performance of brave, wreck-it ralph and marvel's iron man 3 in the current year compared to marvel's the avengers, cars 2, the lion king diamond release and pirates of the caribbean: on stranger tides in the prior year along with lower catalog sales.
the increase in tv/svod distribution and other revenue was driven by domestic svod sales of library titles in the current year and the inclusion of lucasfilm's special effects business.
cost and expenses operating expenses included an increase of $121 million in film cost amortization, from $1,685 million to $1,806 million, driven by more significant titles in theatrical release in the current year, including the two feature animation releases, and higher tv/svod revenues. these increases were partially offset by the impact of lower home entertainment unit sales and lower film impairments. lower film impairments reflected the write-down of the lone ranger in the current year compared to the write-down of john carter and higher development costs write-offs in the prior year. operating expenses also include distribution costs and cost of goods sold, which decreased $17 million from $1,223 million to $1,206 million driven by a decline in home entertainment unit sales, partially offset by the inclusion of lucasfilm's special effects business.
selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $92 million from $2,053 million to $2,145 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing expenses driven by two disney feature animation releases in the current year compared to none in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment marketing.
the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of lucasfilm.
segment operating income segment operating income decreased 8% to $661 million primarily due to lower results at our home entertainment business, partially offset by an increase in tv/svod distribution results and lower film cost write-downs.
table of contents consumer products operating results for the consumer products segment are as follows:
year ended           % changebetter /(worse)
revenues the 10% increase in licensing and publishing revenues was due to increases of 8% from our licensing business and 2% from our publishing business. the increase at licensing was due to the inclusion of revenues from lucasfilm and the performance of merchandise based on disney junior, monsters university, mickey and minnie, iron man and planes partially offset by lower earned revenue from cars and winnie the pooh merchandise. merchandise licensing growth also benefited from higher recognition of minimum guarantees and a licensee audit settlement. the increase at publishing was due to international sales of books based on disney channel properties and higher revenues at our english language learning centers in china.
the 9% increase in retail and other revenue was from our retail business, due to comparable store sales growth in our key markets, a new wholesale distribution business in north america, higher online sales in north america and europe, and the benefit of store format changes in north america and japan. these increases were partially offset by an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen.
costs and expenses operating expenses included an increase of $48 million in cost of goods sold, from $593 million to $641 million, due to higher sales at our retail business. operating expenses also include distribution, labor and occupancy costs, which decreased $4 million from $814 million to $810 million. the decrease was due to lower third-party royalty expense and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen, partially offset by higher labor, distribution and occupancy costs at our retail business.
selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $45 million from $686 million to $731 million primarily due to the inclusion of lucasfilm and higher technology development costs.
the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of lucasfilm.

(1) certain reclassifications have been made to the revenue amounts presented for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 to conform to the fiscal 2014 presentation. the principal change was to reclassify game-related revenue from our japan mobile business from other content to games.
revenues the increase in games revenue was due to an increase of 26% from higher self-published console game revenues due to the fourth quarter release of disney infinity 1.0 and 7% due to the inclusion of lucasfilm's interactive games business.
other content revenue was essentially flat as an unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen and lower online advertising revenues were offset by higher revenues at our japan mobile business due to a licensing agreement that started in february 2012.
costs and expenses operating expenses included an $80 million increase in cost of sales from $252 million to $332 million and a $5 million decrease in product development costs from $331 million to $326 million. higher cost of sales was due to the release of disney infinity 1.0 and the inclusion of lucasfilm.
selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $20 million from $429 million to $449 million due to higher marketing costs at our console games business in connection with the release of disney infinity 1.0, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen.

table of contents pension and postretirement medical benefit costs pension and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with approximately one-third of these costs being borne by the parks and resorts segment. the company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of $309 million, $698 million and $626 million for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease in fiscal 2014 was driven by an increase in the assumed discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations. the assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available and was determined by considering the average of yield curves constructed from a large population of high-quality corporate bonds. the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.
in fiscal 2015, we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to increase to approximately $460 million. the increase in pension and postretirement medical costs is driven by a lower assumed discount rate and updated assumed mortality rates to reflect life expectancy improvements. the decrease in the discount rate and the update to our assumed mortality rates also resulted in an increase in the underfunded status of our plans from $1.9 billion to $3.5 billion and an increase in unrecognized pension and postretirement medical expense to $3.5 billion ($2.2 billion after tax) from $2.0 billion ($1.2 billion after tax). if our future investment returns do not exceed our long-term expected returns and/or discount rates do not increase, a significant portion of the unrecognized pension and postretirement medical costs will be recognized as a net actuarial loss in our income statement over approximately the next 10 years. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impacts of our pension and postretirement medical plans on our financial statements.
during fiscal 2014, the company contributed $275 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans including discretionary contributions above the minimum requirements for pension plans. the company currently expects pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2015 to total approximately $350 million to $375 million. final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2015 will be determined based on our january 1, 2015 funding actuarial valuation, which will be available in late fiscal 2015. see "item 1a - risk factors" for the impact of factors affecting pension and postretirement medical costs.
seven tv investment on november 18, 2011, the company acquired a 49% interest in seven tv for $300 million. seven tv is a broadcast television network that was converted to an advertising-supported, free-to-air disney channel in russia following the acquisition. in october 2014, new regulations were adopted in russia that prohibit more than 20% foreign ownership of media companies and could require the company to divest a portion of its interest by january 2016. the company is evaluating its options with respect to these regulations and, depending on the outcome, we could have an impairment of some or all of our investment. the company's share of the financial results of seven tv is reported as "equity in the income of investees" in the company's consolidated statements of income.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2014 increased 3% or $0.3 billion to $9.8 billion compared to fiscal 2013.  the increase reflected higher operating cash receipts from increased revenues across all of our segments, partially offset by
table of contents higher income tax payments, higher cash payments due to new contractual payment terms for sports rights payments at media networks, higher programming and production spending at media networks and studio entertainment and higher payments at parks and resorts. the increase in cash payments at parks and resorts was due to labor cost inflation and increased spending on new guest offerings. operating cash flows were also impacted by the absence of the celador litigation payment made in fiscal 2013 and lower pension contributions.
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2013 increased 19% or $1.5 billion to $9.5 billion compared to fiscal 2012.  the increase reflected higher operating cash receipts from increased revenues at parks and resorts, media networks and consumer products, the favorable timing of collections at studio entertainment, and lower pension contributions and interest payments. the decrease in interest payments was due to a significant payment of accrued interest in connection with the fiscal 2012 refinancing of disneyland paris' borrowings.  these cash flow increases were partially offset by higher operating cash payments at studio entertainment, media networks and parks and resorts and the payment related to the celador litigation.  the increase in cash payments at studio entertainment was driven by higher film production spending and the timing of participation payments, while the increase in cash payments at media networks was due to higher television programming and production spending.  the increase in cash payments at parks and resorts was due to higher spending on new guest offerings and labor cost inflation, partially offset by the absence of a repurchase of vacation club mortgage receivables, which occurred in fiscal 2012.

investing activities investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. the company's investments in parks, resorts and other property for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:
media networks cable networks                  $172                $176                $170

capital expenditures for the parks and resorts segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and systems infrastructure. the increase in capital expenditures at our international parks and resorts in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was due to higher construction spending on the shanghai disney resort. the decrease in capital expenditures at parks and resorts in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the final progress payment for the disney fantasy cruise ship in fiscal 2012 and higher fiscal 2012 spending in connection with the expansion of disney california adventure, the construction of disney's art of animation resort and the development of mymagic+, partially offset by higher fiscal 2013 spending related to the construction of the shanghai disney resort.
capital expenditures at media networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.
table of contents capital expenditures at corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure and equipment. the decrease in fiscal 2013 reflected higher spending in fiscal 2012 for corporate facilities and information technology infrastructure.
the company currently expects its fiscal 2015 capital expenditures will be approximately $1.5 billion higher than fiscal 2014 capital expenditures of $3.3 billion driven by increased investment at shanghai disney resort. while we fully consolidate capital expenditures for shanghai disney resort, our net contribution is only 43% of the total capital expenditures. therefore, net of shanghai disney resort partner contributions, our capital spending is expected to increase by approximately $1.1 billion.
other investing activities during fiscal 2014, acquisitions totaled $0.4 billion due to the acquisition of maker studios and proceeds from the sales of investments and dispositions totaled $0.4 billion.
during fiscal 2013, acquisitions totaled $2.4 billion driven by the acquisition of lucasfilm. proceeds from dispositions totaled $0.4 billion primarily due to the sale of our 50% equity interest in ess.
during fiscal 2012, acquisitions totaled $1.1 billion driven by the acquisition of an incremental 43% interest in utv and a 49% interest in seven tv in russia. we also made a $300 million equity contribution to aetn.
financing activities cash used in financing activities was $6.7 billion in fiscal 2014 compared to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013.  the net use of cash in the current year was due to $6.5 billion of common stock repurchases and $1.5 billion in dividends, partially offset by cash benefits associated with equity compensation awards of $0.7 billion, net borrowings of $0.6 billion and contributions from our shanghai disney resort joint venture partner of $0.6 billion.  the increase in net cash used in financing activities of $2.5 billion versus the prior fiscal year was due to higher repurchases of common stock.
cash used in financing activities was $4.2 billion in fiscal 2013 compared to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2012.  the net use of cash in fiscal 2013 was due to repurchases of common stock of $4.1 billion and dividends of $1.3 billion, partially offset by cash benefits associated with equity compensation awards of $0.8 billion and contributions from our shanghai disney resort joint venture partner of $0.5 billion.  the increase in net cash used in financing activities of $1.2 billion versus fiscal 2012 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock.

all of the above bank facilities allow for borrowings at libor-based rates plus a spread depending on the credit default swap spread applicable to the company's debt, subject to a cap and floor that vary with the company's debt rating assigned by moody's investors service and standard and poor's. the spread above libor can range from 0.23% to 1.63%. the company also has the ability to issue up to $800 million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in march 2019, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. as of september 27, 2014, $223 million of letters of credit had been issued of which none were issued under this facility.
the company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.
during fiscal 2014, the company repurchased 84 million shares of its common stock for $6.5 billion. during fiscal 2013, the company repurchased 71 million shares of its common stock for $4.1 billion. during fiscal 2012, the company repurchased 72 million shares of its common stock for $3.0 billion. as of september 27, 2014, the company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase 77 million additional shares.
we believe that the company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. however, the company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. see "item 1a - risk factors". in addition to macroeconomic factors, the company's borrowing costs can be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. as of september 27, 2014, moody's investors service's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a2 and p-1, respectively, with stable outlook; standard & poor's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and a-1, respectively, with stable outlook; and fitch's long- and short-term debt ratings for the company were a and f-1, respectively, with stable outlook. the company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the company met on september 27, 2014, by a significant margin. the company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as disneyland paris, hong kong disneyland resort and shanghai disney resort, from any representations, covenants or events of default.
contractual obligations, commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. for example, the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.
table of contents the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments on an undiscounted basis at september 27, 2014 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. in addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings based on their contractual maturities. additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the table:

contingent commitments and contractual guarantees the company has certain contractual arrangements that would require the company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur. the company has recognized a $198 million liability for the fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of maker studios, inc. the company does not currently expect that other contractual arrangements will result in any significant amounts being paid by the company. see notes 3, 6 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's contingent commitments and contractual guarantees.
legal and tax matters as disclosed in notes 9 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the company has exposure for certain tax and legal matters.
disneyland paris refinancing at september 27, 2014, disneyland paris had €1.8 billion in loans outstanding from the company. in order to improve disneyland paris' financial position, disneyland paris announced, with the company's backing, a €1.0 billion recapitalization through a rights offering to raise €0.4 billion of equity along with the conversion of €0.6 billion of loans from the company into equity in disneyland paris. (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.)
table of contents accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
film and television revenues and costs we expense film and television production, participation and residual costs over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (ultimate revenues) for each production. if our estimate of ultimate revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs may be accelerated. conversely, if our estimate of ultimate revenues increases, film and television cost amortization may be slowed. for film productions, ultimate revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years from the date of the initial theatrical release. for television series, ultimate revenues include revenues that will be earned within ten years from delivery of the first episode, or if still in production, five years from delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
with respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues (and therefore affecting future film cost amortization and/or impairment) is theatrical performance. revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release (e.g., the home entertainment or television markets) have historically been highly correlated with the theatrical performance. theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. upon a film's release and determination of the theatrical performance, the company's estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the level of expected home entertainment sales. home entertainment sales vary based on the number and quality of competing home entertainment products as well as the manner in which retailers market and price our products.
with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the program's rating and the strength of the advertising market. program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the company's ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing of the program. in addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in the syndication, international and home entertainment markets. alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which would require an immediate write-down of any unamortized production costs. a significant decline in the advertising market would also negatively impact our estimates.
we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired series, movies and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired or on a straight-line basis over the useful life, as appropriate. amortization of those television programming assets being amortized on a number of airings basis may be accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated future airings. the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the program's ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates and availability and quality of alternative programming. accordingly, planned usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. we amortize rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements during the applicable seasons based on the estimated relative value of each year in the arrangement. the estimated values of each year are based on our projections of revenues over the contract period, which include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. if the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season's relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. if planned usage patterns or estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.
costs of film and television productions are subject to regular recoverability assessments, which compare the estimated fair values with the unamortized costs. the net realizable values of television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. the company's dayparts are: primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports (includes broadcast and cable networks). the net realizable values of other cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable network. individual programs are written off when there are no plans to air or sublicense the program. estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, film, television and programming cost write-downs may be required.
revenue recognition the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.
table of contents we reduce home entertainment and game revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. these estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends and projections of customer demand for and acceptance of our products. if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated.
we recognize revenues from advance theme park ticket sales when the tickets are used. we recognize revenues from expiring multi-use tickets ratably over the estimated usage period. for non-expiring, multi-day tickets, we recognize revenue over a five-year time period based on estimated usage. the estimated usage periods are derived from historical usage patterns. if actual usage is different than our estimated usage, revenues may not be recognized in the periods the related services are rendered. in addition, a change in usage patterns would impact the timing of revenue recognition.
pension and postretirement medical plan actuarial assumptions the company's pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. the guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. we decreased our discount rate to 4.40% at the end of fiscal 2014 from 5.00% at the end of fiscal 2013 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our september 27, 2014 measurement date. this decrease in the discount rate will affect net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense in fiscal 2015. the assumed discount rate reflects market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. the company's discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds. the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total benefit expense for fiscal 2015 by $203 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at september 27, 2014 by $2.1 billion. a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total benefit expense and the projected benefit obligation by $188 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.
to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. a one percentage point change in the long-term asset return assumption would impact fiscal 2015 annual benefit expense by $100 million.
see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our pension and postretirement medical plans.
goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments the company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the goodwill.
to determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. we apply what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. the discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. we include in the projected cash flows an estimate of the revenue we believe the reporting unit would receive if the intellectual property developed by the reporting unit that is being used by other reporting units was licensed to an unrelated third party at its fair market value. these amounts are not necessarily the same as those included in segment operating results. we believe our estimates of fair value are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.
in times of adverse economic conditions in the global economy, the company's long-term cash flow projections are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual. if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
table of contents the company is required to compare the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying amounts. if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.
the company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. the impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. an asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses or segments. if the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the group's long-lived assets and the carrying value of the group's long-lived assets. the impairment is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts, but only to the extent the carrying value of each asset is above its fair value. for assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying value is greater than the asset's fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of the asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values. if we had established different asset groups or utilized different valuation methodologies or assumptions, the impairment test results could differ, and we could be required to record impairment charges.
the company has cost and equity investments. the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the investee companies as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. in assessing potential impairment of these investments, we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investees and market values, where available. if these forecasts are not met or market values indicate an other-than-temporary decline in value, impairment charges may be required.
during the current year, the company tested its goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and long-lived assets for impairment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $46 million related to radio fcc licenses held by businesses in the media networks segment. the radio fcc license impairment charges were determined in connection with the plan to sell radio disney stations and the fair value was derived from market transactions. during fiscal years 2013 and 2012, the company recorded impairments totaling $5 million and $0, respectively. these impairment charges were recorded in "restructuring and impairment charges" in the consolidated statements of income.
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on our analysis of historical bad debt experience in conjunction with our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business. in times of domestic or global economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. if our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods.
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.
income tax audits as a matter of course, the company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. the tax benefits ultimately realized by the company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the company's decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the company's success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.

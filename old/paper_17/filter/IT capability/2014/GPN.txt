item 1a- risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. you should consider carefully the following risks and other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k and other sec filings before you decide whether to buy our common stock. the risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations. if any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. as a result, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.
risks related to our business and operations inability to safeguard our data from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks could affect our reputation among our merchant clients and cardholders and may expose us to penalties, fines, liabilities and legal claims.
under the card network rules and various national and state laws, we are responsible for information provided to us by merchants, isos, third-party service providers and other agents (all of which we refer to as "associated third parties"), which we require in order to approve merchant accounts, process transactions and for the purpose of fraud prevention.  this information includes confidential data such as: bankcard numbers, names, addresses, social security numbers, driver's license numbers and bank account numbers.  we process the data and deliver our products and services by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks which are operated both by us and by third-party service providers.  we have the ultimate liability to the card networks and their member financial institutions for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties to protect this information.  while plans and procedures are in place to protect this sensitive data, we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful and will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats which are designed to breach our systems in order to gain access to confidential information.
our computer systems have been, and could be in the future, subject to penetration, and our data protection measures may not prevent unauthorized access. threats to our systems and our associated third parties' systems can derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. computer viruses can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties. in addition, denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes, including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities.
our defensive measures may not prevent unauthorized access or use of sensitive data. while we maintain first- and third-party insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses.
we could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information, such as unauthorized marketing purposes and violation of data privacy laws. we generally require that our agreements with service providers who have access to merchant and customer data include confidentiality obligations but we cannot be certain that these contractual requirements are always followed or that they will always prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data. in addition, we have agreed in certain agreements to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of merchant and consumer data. the costs of systems and procedures associated with such protective measures may increase and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. any failure to adequately enforce or provide these protective measures could result in liability, protracted and costly litigation and, with respect to misuse of personal information of our merchants and consumers, lost revenue and reputational harm.
any type of security breach or other misuse of data described above or otherwise could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our products and services or from making electronic payments generally, increase our operating expenses in order to contain and remediate the breach, expose us to unbudgeted or uninsured liability, disrupt our operations (including potential service interruptions), distract our management, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, result in the imposition of penalties and fines under state, federal and foreign laws or by the card networks, and adversely affect our continued card network registration and financial institution sponsorship. our removal from networks' lists of pci dss compliant service providers could mean that existing merchant customers, sales partners or other third parties may cease using or referring our products and services. also, prospective merchant customers, sales partners or other third parties may choose to terminate negotiations with us, or delay or choose not to consider us for their processing needs. in addition, the card networks could refuse to allow us to process through their networks.
for example, in march 2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our north america card processing system and potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected from u.s. merchants who applied for processing services. as a result of this event, certain card networks temporarily removed us from their lists of
pci dss compliant service providers. after remediating our processes and systems, we returned to the lists of pci dss compliant service providers in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. we incurred approximately $114.2 million of cumulative expenses, net of insurance recoveries, relating to the incident. the impact on revenue of terminations that we can confirm related to our temporary removal from the lists was immaterial. also, the impact on revenue of merchants, sales partners or other third parties who have failed to renew, terminated negotiations or informed us they are not considering us at all, where we can confirm it is due to our removal from the lists, was immaterial. this event has resulted in inquiries from governmental entities and investigation by the federal trade commission ("ftc").
the payment processing industry is highly competitive, and some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do, which may give them an advantage in our market with respect to the pricing of products and services offered to our customers and the ability to develop new technologies.
we operate in the electronic payments market, which is highly competitive. in this market, our primary competitors include other independent payment processors, as well as financial institutions, isos and, potentially, card networks. many of our competitors are companies that are larger than we are, with greater financial and operational resources than we have. our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a direct member for participation in the card networks and may be able to settle transactions more quickly for merchants than we can. these financial institutions may also provide payment processing services to merchants at a loss in order to generate banking fees from the merchants. it is also possible that larger financial institutions could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide. these attributes may provide them with a competitive advantage in the market. higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
furthermore, we are facing increasing competition from non-traditional competitors who offer certain innovations in payment methods. some of these competitors utilize proprietary software and service solutions. others partner with traditional merchant acquirers to provide tablet-based solutions with payment processing services. some of these non-traditional competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers. in addition, some non-traditional competitors, such as private companies or startup companies, may be less risk averse than we are and, therefore, may be able to respond more quickly to market demands. if these non-traditional competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. these competitors may compete in ways that minimize or remove the role of traditional card networks, processors and/or point-of-sale software in the electronic payments process.
in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings, we must continually and quickly update our products and services, a process which could result in increased costs and the loss of revenues, earnings and customers if the new products and services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace.
the electronic payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing customer needs. in order to remain competitive, we are continually involved in a number of projects, including the development of a new authorization platform, mobile payment applications, e-commerce services and other new offerings emerging in the electronic payments industry. these projects carry the risks associated with any development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance problems. in the electronic payments markets, these risks are even more acute. any delay in the delivery of new products or services or the failure to differentiate our products and services could render them less desirable to our customers, or possibly even obsolete. furthermore, as the market for alternative payment processing products and services evolves, it may develop too rapidly or not rapidly enough for us to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new products and services targeted at this market.
in addition, the products and services we deliver to the electronic payments markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions, all at very high volumes and processing speeds. any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses. as a result of these factors, our development efforts could result in increased costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenue and earnings if promised new products are not timely delivered to our customers or do not perform as anticipated. we rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies.
our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. for example, "emv" is a credit and debit card authentication methodology using integrated circuit cards (or "chip cards") that visa, mastercard, american express and discover mandated that u.s. processors be able to support as of april 2013 and that
merchants be able to support by october 2015. we have invested, and may continue to invest, significant resources to develop and implement support for emv before the applicable deadlines. we are not certain if or when our merchants will use or accept the methodology, or if and when issuers will provide emv cards to consumers in significant volumes.
our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa cards and mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard registration and financial institution sponsorship and, in some cases, continued membership in certain card networks.
in order to provide our visa and mastercard transaction processing services, we must be either a direct participant or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of visa and mastercard. registration as a merchant processor or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by members of both organizations. if our sponsor banks should stop providing sponsorship for us, we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct membership with the card networks, either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive. if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct membership, we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers, which would negatively impact our revenues and earnings. furthermore, some agreements with our bank sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants. our bank sponsors' discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in connection with direct membership, the rules and regulations of various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements. any increase in the capital level required would limit our use of capital for other purposes.
we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. if we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement, our business may be adversely affected.
we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. if such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services, we must find other financial institutions to provide those services. if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers, which could negatively impact our revenue and earnings.
if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks, they could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations. if our merchants or isos incur fines or penalties that we cannot collect from them, we could end up bearing the cost of such fines or penalties.
we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card networks for certain acts or omissions. the rules of the card networks are set by their boards, which may be influenced by card issuers, and some of those issuers are our competitors with respect to these processing services. many banks directly or indirectly sell processing services to merchants in direct competition with us. these banks could attempt, by virtue of their influence on the networks, to alter the networks' rules or policies to the detriment of non-members like us. the termination of our registrations or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor, or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards, that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. if a merchant or an iso fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks, it could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks. if we cannot collect such amounts from the applicable merchant or iso, we could end up bearing such fines or penalties, resulting in lower earnings for us. the termination of our registration, or any changes in the visa or mastercard rules that would impair our registration, could require us to stop providing visa and mastercard payment processing services, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale.
our systems and our third-party providers' systems may fail, which could interrupt our service, cause us to lose business, increase our costs and expose us to liability.
we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems, software, data centers and telecommunications networks, as well as the systems and services of third parties. in addition, we have undertaken the relocation of our primary data center. we have entered into agreements related to this relocation and for the ongoing management of the data center.
a system outage or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. not only would we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss, but we may also be liable to third
parties. our systems and operations or those of our third-party providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist acts, war, unauthorized entry, human error, and computer viruses or other defects. defects in our systems or those of third parties, errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, telecommunications failures, or other difficulties (including those related to system relocation) could result in loss of revenue, loss of customers, loss of merchant and cardholder data, harm to our business or reputation, exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities, negative publicity, additional operating and development costs, fines and other sanctions imposed by card networks, and/or diversion of technical and other resources.
we may experience software defects, undetected errors, and development delays, which could damage customer relations, decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability.
our products are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that often encounter development delays and the underlying software may contain undetected errors, viruses or defects. defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential customers, harm to our reputation and exposure to liability claims.
in addition, we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors, viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
increased merchant, referral partner or iso attrition could cause our financial results to decline.
we experience attrition in merchant credit and debit card processing volume resulting from several factors, including business closures, transfers of merchants' accounts to our competitors, unsuccessful contract renewal negotiation and account closures that we initiate for various reasons, such as heightened credit risks or contract breaches by merchants. if an iso partner switches to another transaction processor, terminates our services, internalizes payment processing functions that we perform, merges with or is acquired by one of our competitors, or shuts down or becomes insolvent, we may no longer receive new merchant referrals from the iso, and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the iso. we cannot predict the level of attrition in the future and it could increase. our referral partners are a significant source of new business. higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in order for us to continue to grow and increase our profitability, we must continue to expand our share of the existing electronic payments markets and also expand into new markets.
our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate, the further expansion of these markets, the emergence of other markets for electronic transaction payment processing and our ability to penetrate these markets. as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion, we look for acquisition opportunities, investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration, technological capabilities, product offerings and distribution capabilities. we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition, investment and alliance candidates in the future, and if we do, they may not provide us with the value and benefits we anticipate.
our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market. we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets. if we fail to expand into new and existing electronic payments markets, we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings.
there may be a decline in the use of cards as a payment mechanism for consumers or adverse developments with respect to the card industry in general.
if consumers do not continue to use credit or debit cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash, credit cards, and debit cards, which is adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. consumer credit risk may make it more difficult or expensive for consumers to gain access to credit facilities such as credit cards. regulatory changes may result in financial institutions seeking to charge their customers additional fees for use of credit or debit cards. such fees may result in decreased use of credit or debit cards by cardholders. in each case, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. we believe future growth in the use of credit and debit cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost, ease-of-use, and quality of products and services offered to consumers and businesses. in order to consistently increase and maintain our
profitability, consumers and businesses must continue to use electronic payment methods that we process, including credit and debit cards.
we incur chargeback liability when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers. we cannot accurately anticipate these liabilities, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant, the transaction is normally "charged back" to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. if we are unable to collect such amounts from the merchant's account or reserve account (if applicable), or if the merchant refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for a chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. the risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment. we may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future. any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have policies to manage merchant-related credit risk and often mitigate such risk by requiring collateral and monitoring transaction activity. notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk, it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business.
fraud by merchants or others could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
we have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others. examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit or debit card, card number, or other credentials to record a false sales or credit transaction, processes an invalid card, or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud. failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback liability or cause us to incur other liabilities. it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. increases in chargebacks or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
we are subject to economic and political risk, the business cycles and credit risk of our customers and the overall level of consumer, business and government spending, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the global electronic payments industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. we are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income or changes in consumer purchasing habits. a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or increases in interest rates may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions made using electronic payments. a reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenue and profits. if our merchants make fewer sales of their products and services using electronic payments or people spend less money per transaction, we will have fewer transactions to process at lower dollar amounts, resulting in lower revenue.
a downturn in the economy could force retailers to close, resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and future transaction declines. furthermore, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and be more selective with respect to whom they issue credit cards. we also have a certain amount of fixed and other costs, including rent, debt service, and salaries, which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy. changes in economic conditions could also adversely impact our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, a recessionary economic environment could affect our merchants through a higher rate of bankruptcy filings, resulting in lower revenues and earnings for us. our merchants are liable for any charges properly reversed by the card issuer on behalf of the cardholder. our associated third parties are also liable for any fines or penalties that may be assessed by any card networks. in the event that we are not able to collect such amounts from our merchants or the associated third parties, due to fraud, breach of contract, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such charges.
reject losses arise from the fact that, in most markets, we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period. this results in the build-up of a substantial receivable from our customers. if a merchant has gone out of business during the billing period, we may be unable to collect such fees, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
increases in credit card network fees may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in our earnings.
from time-to-time, the card networks, including visa and mastercard, increase the fees that they charge processors. we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers, but this strategy might result in the loss of customers to our competitors who do not pass along the increases. if competitive practices prevent us from passing along such increased fees to our merchant customers in the future, we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases, thereby reducing our net revenues, increasing our operating costs and reducing our earnings.
any new implementation of or changes made to laws, regulations, card network rules or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable impact to our financial results.
our business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect our industry in the countries in which we operate. regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years. failure to comply with regulations or guidelines may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration, the limitation, suspension or termination of service, and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or may cause customers or potential customers to be reluctant to do business with us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. for example, we are subject to the card network rules of visa, mastercard and other card networks, interac, and various debit networks; applicable privacy and information security regulations in the regions where we operate and of the card networks; the payment services directive in europe; the code of conduct for the credit and debit card industry in canada (issued by canada's department of finance); housing assistance tax act of 2008 in the united states, which requires information returns to be made for each calendar year by merchant acquiring entities, along with a myriad of consumer protection laws and escheat regulations. we are also subject to examination by the ffiec as a result of our provision of data processing services to financial institutions.
interchange fees (which are typically paid by the acquirer to the issuer in connection with transactions) are subject to increasingly intense legal, regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide. for instance, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the "dodd-frank act"), which was signed into law in july 2010, significantly changed the u.s. financial regulatory system. changes affecting the payment processing industry include restricting amounts of debit card fees that certain issuing institutions can charge merchants and allowing merchants to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts for different payment methods. these restrictions could negatively affect the number of debit transactions, which would adversely affect our business. the dodd-frank act also created the consumer financial protection bureau (the "cfpb"), which has assumed responsibility for most federal consumer protection laws, and the financial stability oversight council, which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company, such as us, should be supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system (the "federal reserve") because it is systemically important to the u.s. financial system. any such designation would result in increased regulatory burdens on our business, which increases our risk profile and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, since october 2011, (i) a card payment network may not prohibit a card issuer from contracting with any other card payment network for the processing of electronic debit transactions involving the issuer's debit cards and (ii) card issuing financial institutions and card payment networks may not inhibit the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions over any card payment networks that can process the transactions. since april 2012, most debit card issuers have been required to enable at least two unaffiliated card payment networks on each debit card. the interchange fee cap has the potential to alter the type or volume of card-based transactions that we process on behalf of our merchants. these new regulations could result in the need for us to make capital investments to modify our services to facilitate our existing merchants' and potential merchants' compliance and reduce the fees we are able to charge our merchants. these new regulations also could result in greater pricing transparency and increased price-based competition leading to lower margins and higher rates of merchant attrition. the requirements of the new regulations and the timing of their effective dates could result in changes in our merchants' business practices that may alter their delivery of their products and services to consumers and the timing of their investment decisions, which could change the demand for our services and alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our merchants. any new rules or regulations implemented by the cfpb or the fsoc or in connection with the dodd-frank act that are applicable to us, or any changes that are adverse to us resulting from litigation brought by third parties challenging such rules and regulations, could increase our cost of doing business or limit permissible activities.
all persons engaged in commerce, including, but not limited to, us and our merchant and financial institution customers, are subject to section 5 of the ftc act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices ("udap"). in addition, there are other laws, rules and or regulations, including the telemarketing sales act, that may directly impact the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us, as the merchant's payment processor, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services. various federal and state regulatory enforcement
agencies, including ftc and the states' attorneys general have the authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in udap or violate other laws, rules or regulations and, to the extent we are processing payments for a merchant that may be in violation of these laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities.
changes to legal rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, even if not directed at us, may require significant efforts to change our systems and products and may require changes to how we price our services to customers, adversely affecting our business. even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could damage our business or our reputation. furthermore, we are subject to tax laws in each jurisdiction where we conduct business. changes in such laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive, the value of tax losses and tax credit carry forwards recorded on our balance sheet and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
we are subject to risks associated with changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations, and we may not effectively hedge against these risks.
we have incurred significant indebtedness that accrues interest at a variable rate, and we may incur additional variable-rate indebtedness in the future. increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases or dividends. we are also subject to risks related to the changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. revenue and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results. for example, for fiscal 2014, currency rate fluctuations decreased our revenues by $10.8 million and our diluted earnings per share by $0.05 as compared to the prior year, calculated by converting our fiscal 2014 actual revenues and expenses at fiscal 2013 rates.
in addition, in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currency into u.s. dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions. the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse impact on our business.
we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates through the use of hedging arrangements. to the extent that we hedge our interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate exposures, we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates were to change in our favor. developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates is complex, and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations. in addition, a counterparty to the arrangement could default on its obligation, thereby exposing us to credit risk. we may have to repay certain costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate these arrangements. finally, our interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if such rates move materially differently from our expectations. as a result, we cannot provide any assurance that our hedging arrangements, if any, will effectively manage our interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
we conduct a portion of our business in various european and asia-pacific countries, including the russian federation, where the risk of continued political, economic and regulatory change that could impact our operating results is greater than in the united states.
we expect to continue to expand our operations into various countries in europe and the asia-pacific region. some of these countries, and other foreign countries in which we operate, such as the russian federation, have undergone significant political, economic and social change in recent years, and the risk of new, unforeseen changes in these countries remains greater than in the united states. our business, growth, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by instability or changes in a country's or region's economic conditions; changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, whether caused by a change in government or otherwise; increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict; or action by the european union or the united states, canada or other governments that may restrict our ability to transact business in a foreign country or with certain foreign individuals or entities, such as sanctions by or against the russian federation.
in addition, transmittal of data by electronic means and telecommunications is subject to specific regulation in many countries. although these regulations have not had a material impact on us to date, changes in these regulations, including taxation or limitations on transfers of data between countries, could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, financial condition or results of operations.
the integration and conversion of our acquired operations, or other future acquisitions, if any, could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating both businesses as one are not achieved, a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process, and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process.
the acquisition, integration, and conversion of businesses involve a number of risks. core risks are in the area of valuation (negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited diligence) and integration and conversion (managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company's people, products, technology and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition). in addition, international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including, for example: managing geographically separated organizations, systems, and facilities; integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures; complying with foreign regulatory requirements; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries; difficulty entering new foreign markets due to, among other things, customer acceptance and business knowledge of those new markets; and general economic and political conditions.
if the integration and conversion process does not proceed smoothly, the following factors, among others, could reduce our revenues and earnings, increase our operating costs, and result in a loss of projected synergies:
•   if we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits plans, duties and responsibilities, and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business, we could lose employees to our competitors in the region, which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration;
•   if the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services, or the quality of those services, we could lose customers to our competitors, which would reduce our revenues and earnings; and
•   the acquisition and the related integration could divert the attention of our management from other strategic matters including possible acquisitions and alliances and planning for new product development or expansion into new electronic payments markets.
the costs and effects of pending and future litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
we are from time-to-time involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business. our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws. should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in our rapidly developing legal framework, we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or may develop software or technology competitive to us. our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or services or design around our intellectual property rights. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which is expensive and could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful. the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.
we may also be subject to costly litigation in the event our products and technology infringe upon another party's proprietary rights. third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that would be infringed by our products or technology. any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products or technology. we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark or license usage rights. any such claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages. an adverse determination in any litigation of this type could limit our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims and require us to design around a third party's patent, which may not be possible, or to license alternative technology from another party, which may be costly. in addition, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees.
historically, the banking industry has been the subject of consolidation, regardless of overall economic conditions, while the retail industry has been the subject of consolidation due to cyclical economic events. since 2008, there have been multiple bank failures and government-encouraged consolidation. larger banks and larger merchants with greater transaction volumes may demand lower fees which could result in lower revenues and earnings for us. our bank alliances and other strategies could also be negatively impacted as a result of consolidations, especially where the banks involved operate competing merchant processing businesses.
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense.
our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations. we have established contingent liabilities for material known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority. while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability. an unfavorable resolution, therefore, could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in the current and/or future periods.
we record deferred income taxes to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial accounting and income tax purposes. deferred income taxes are determined using enacted tax rates. changes in enacted tax rates may negatively impact our results of operations.
we may become subject to additional u.s., state or foreign taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchant services customers, in which case our earnings could be adversely affected.
payment processing companies like us may be subject to taxation by various jurisdictions on our net income or certain portions of our fees charged to customers for our services. application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and the taxing authorities have not yet all adopted uniform regulations on this topic. if we are required to pay such taxes and are not able to pass the tax expense through to our merchant customers, our costs will increase, reducing our earnings.
we have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations of such laws which have been confirmed through either tax rulings or opinions obtained in various jurisdictions, including those related to value added taxes in europe. changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive and the amount of our cash flow and have a material adverse impact on our business.
risks related to our organizational and capital structure if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow, our business could be adversely affected.
all of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological, social, economic and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital. to successfully compete and grow, we must recruit, develop and retain the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of intellectual capital needs. in addition, we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital. however, the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. our efforts to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could negatively affect our profitability. we cannot assure that key personnel, including executive officers, will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the company's debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit the company's flexibility in operating its business.
our credit facilities contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to engage in specified types of transactions. these covenants limit our ability in certain circumstances to, among other things:
•   incur additional indebtedness;
•   consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the company's assets;
•   enter into certain lines of business; and
•   enter into certain transactions with the company's affiliates.
our credit facilities also contain customary financial covenants based on our leverage ratio and our fixed charge coverage ratio.
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions and, in the case of the revolving credit facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. such actions by those lenders could cause cross defaults under certain of our other indebtedness. if we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our credit facilities could accelerate the repayment of borrowings, and we may not have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities as well as the company's other indebtedness.
our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
as a result of our acquisitions, a significant portion of our total assets consist of intangible assets (including goodwill). goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, together accounted for approximately 46.6% and 46.2% of the total assets on our balance sheet as of may 31, 2014 and may 31, 2013, respectively. we may not realize the full value of our intangible assets and goodwill. we expect to engage in additional acquisitions, which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill. we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired. under current accounting rules, any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to write-off the impaired portion of goodwill and such intangible assets, resulting in a charge to our earnings. an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
the extent to which we pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase our common stock in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other factors, our earnings, shareholders' equity, cash position, and financial condition. no assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends or repurchase any shares in the foreseeable future.
our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.
we operate in a rapidly changing industry. accordingly, our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify, monitor and manage our risks. if our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always successful in capturing all risks to which we are or may be exposed, we may suffer uninsured liability, harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.
section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report.  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act.
further, this assessment may be complicated by any acquisitions we may complete.  in certain markets, including, without limitation, china, the republic of malta and spain, our member sponsors perform payment processing operations and related support services pursuant to services agreements.  we expect that the member sponsors will continue to provide these services until such time as we may integrate these functions into our operations.  accordingly, we rely on our member sponsors to provide financial data, such as revenue billed to merchants, to assist us with compiling our accounting records.  as such, our internal controls over financial reporting could be materially affected, or are reasonably likely to be materially affected, by the internal controls and procedures of our member sponsors in these markets.  in order to mitigate this risk, we have implemented internal controls over financial reporting which monitor the accuracy of the financial data being provided by our member sponsors.
while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market's perception of our business and our stock price.
anti-takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws and provisions of georgia law could delay or prevent a change of control that individual shareholders favor.
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws and provisions of applicable georgia law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that shareholders may consider favorable. the provisions of our articles and by-laws, among other things:
•   divide our board of directors into three classes, with members of each class to be elected in staggered three-year terms;
•   limit the right of shareholders to remove directors;
•   regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of shareholders; and
•   authorize our board of directors to issue preferred shares in one or more series, without shareholder approval.
item 7- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in "item 1a - risk factors" of this report. see "cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements" located above "item 1 - business."
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with "item 6 - selected financial data" and "item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data" appearing elsewhere in this annual report.
general we are one of the largest worldwide providers of payment solutions for merchants, value-added resellers, enterprise software providers, financial institutions, government agencies, multi-national corporations and independent sales organizations ("isos") located throughout north america, europe and the asia-pacific region and in brazil. we provide payment and digital commerce solutions and operate in two business segments, north america merchant services and international merchant services. we were incorporated in georgia as global payments inc. in september 2000 and spun-off from our former parent company on january 31, 2001. including our time as part of our former parent company, we have been in the payments business since 1967. global payments inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to collectively as "global payments," the "company," "we," "our" or "us," unless the context requires otherwise.
our north america merchant services and international merchant services segments target customers in many vertical industries including financial services, gaming, government, health care, professional services, restaurants, retail, universities, nonprofit organizations and utilities.
our offerings enable merchants to accept check, card, electronic and digital-based payments at the point of sale. our primary business model provides payment products and services directly to merchants as our end customers. we also provide similar products and services to financial institutions and a limited number of isos that, in turn, resell our products and services, in which case the financial institutions and select isos are our end customers. these particular services are marketed in the united states, canada and parts of europe.
the majority of merchant services revenue is generated on services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on card type. we also charge other fees based on specific services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. revenue from credit cards and signature debit cards is generally based on a percentage of transaction value along with other related fees, while revenue from pin-based debit cards is typically based on a fee per transaction.
our products and services are marketed through a variety of sales channels that include a direct sales force, trade associations, integrated payment technology, agent and enterprise software providers and var referral arrangements, isos, as well as proprietary telesales groups. we seek to leverage the continued shift to electronic payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels or through acquisitions in north america, the asia-pacific region and europe, and investing in and leveraging technology and people, thereby maximizing shareholder value. we also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions in europe and the asia-pacific and latin america regions.
our business does not have pronounced seasonality in which more than 30% of our revenues occur in one fiscal quarter. however, each geographic channel has somewhat higher and lower quarters given the nature of the portfolio. while there is some variation in seasonality across markets, the first and fourth quarters are generally the strongest, and the third quarter tends to be the weakest due to lower volumes processed in the months of january and february.
executive overview in fiscal 2014, revenues increased 7.5% to $2,554.2 million from $2,375.9 million in fiscal 2013, reflecting growth in all of our markets.
consolidated operating income was $405.5 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $357.2 million for fiscal 2013. consolidated operating income includes a processing system intrusion credit of $7.0 million for fiscal 2014 and a charge of $36.8 million for fiscal 2013. net income attributable to global payments increased $29.2 million, or 13.5%, to $245.3 million in fiscal 2014 from $216.1 million in the prior year, resulting in a $0.61 increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.37 in fiscal 2014 from $2.76 in fiscal 2013.
north america merchant services segment revenue increased $103.3 million, or 6.1%, to $1,809.0 million in fiscal 2014 from $1,705.7 million in fiscal 2013. north america merchant services segment operating income increased to $272.3 million in fiscal 2014 from $258.9 million in fiscal 2013, with operating margins of 15.0% and 15.2% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the growth in the north america merchant services segment is primarily due to growth in our u.s. direct channels, including the addition of recently acquired paypros, and growth in canada, which was partially offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates.
international merchant services segment revenue increased $75.0 million, or 11.2%, to $745.2 million in fiscal 2014 from $670.2 million in fiscal 2013. international merchant services operating income also increased to $240.2 million in fiscal 2014 from $211.2 million in fiscal 2013, with operating margins of 32.2% and 31.5% for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. the growth in the international merchant services segment is due to growth across our european markets and in the asia-pacific region.
on february 28, 2014, we closed a five-year senior unsecured $1,250.0 million term loan and $1,000.0 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. the proceeds from the term loan were used to repay the outstanding balance of the previously existing term loan and credit facilities and to partially fund the acquisition of payment processing, inc. ("paypros") on march 4, 2014. we have used and will continue to use the remaining capacity to support strategic growth initiatives, including acquisitions and ongoing share repurchases.
on march 4, 2014, we completed the acquisition of paypros for $420.0 million in cash plus $7.7 million in cash for working capital, subject to adjustment based on a final determination of working capital. we funded the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from our new debt facilities discussed above. paypros, based in california, is a provider of fully-integrated payment solutions for small-to-medium sized merchants in the united states.  paypros delivers its products and services through a network of technology-based enterprise software partners to vertical markets that are complementary to the markets served by accelerated payment technologies ("apt"), which we acquired on october 1, 2012. see note 4 - business and intangible asset acquisitions and joint ventures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
results of operations revenues we derive our revenues from four primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services; charges based on transaction quantity; service fees; and equipment sales and rentals. revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions.
operating expenses cost of service cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to operations and technology-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; assessments and other fees paid to card networks; transaction processing systems, including third-party services; network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets and provisions for operating losses.
sales, general and administrative expenses sales, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel; non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management; commissions paid to isos, independent contractors, and other third parties; advertising costs; other selling expenses; share-based compensation expense and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions.
processing system intrusion in march 2012, we identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a limited portion of our north america card processing system and potential unauthorized access to servers containing personal information collected from u.s. merchants who applied for processing services. as a result of this event, we incurred approximately $114.2 million of cumulative expenses, net of insurance recoveries, relating to the incident (including a credit of $7.0 million in fiscal 2014 and a charge of $36.8 million and $84.4 million in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively), and certain card networks temporarily removed us from their lists of pci dss compliant service providers. after remediating our processes and systems, we returned to the lists of pci dss compliant service providers in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. the impact on revenue of terminations that we can confirm related to our temporary removal from the lists was immaterial. also, the impact on revenue of merchants, sales partners or other third parties who have failed to renew, terminated negotiations or informed us they are not considering us at all, where we can confirm it is due to our removal from the lists, was immaterial. we currently maintain first- and third-party insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks. however, in the event of a future system intrusion, we cannot provide any assurances that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover our losses.
operating income and operating margin for the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption "corporate." similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. we also consider costs associated with the processing system intrusion to be a corporate expense.
the following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2014 and 2013, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2013.

(2) includes a processing system intrusion credit of $7.0 million in fiscal 2014 and a charge of $36.8 million in fiscal 2013.
revenues for fiscal 2014, revenues increased 7.5% to $2,554.2 million compared to the prior year, reflecting growth in all of our markets. our revenues were affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. for the year ended may 31, 2014, currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased our revenues by $10.8 million compared to the prior year, calculated by converting our fiscal 2014 actual revenues at fiscal 2013 rates.
north america merchant services segment. for fiscal 2014, revenue from our north america merchant services segment increased 6.1% to $1,809.0 million compared to the prior year. north america revenue growth was driven by our u.s. direct channels, including recently acquired paypros, as well as our iso channels and growth in canada.
we grow our u.s. revenue primarily by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets. for fiscal 2014, our u.s. credit and debit card processed transactions grew 6.6% compared to the prior year, excluding the impact of paypros.
for fiscal 2014, our canadian revenue increased 3.0% to $320.3 million primarily due to credit card transaction growth and assessment-based pricing changes, partially offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates. for fiscal 2014, our total canadian transactions grew 2.5% compared to the prior year, including 4.6% growth in credit card transactions.
in direct merchant acquiring, we provide processing services to merchants and, generally through our relationship with a member sponsor, fund settlement. we market our direct merchant services through a variety of channels, including our iso channel, whereby the iso receives a share of the merchant profitability in the form of a monthly residual payment. revenue for direct merchant services is recognized in the amount of merchant billing net of interchange, and any residual payments to the iso are reflected as a component of selling, general and administrative expense.
in indirect merchant acquiring, the partner, typically a financial institution or an iso, is our customer. we provide processing services to the indirect customer's merchants, but do not provide sponsorship or funds settlement. we bill the indirect customer fees for transactions and various other services, which is recognized as revenue.
international merchant services segment. for fiscal 2014, international merchant services revenue increased 11.2% to $745.2 million compared to the prior year. our europe merchant services revenue for fiscal 2014 increased 12.4% to $587.5 million compared to the prior year driven primarily by transaction growth in all markets as well as growth in our e-commerce services. asia-pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2014 increased 6.9% to $157.8 million compared to the prior year due largely to pricing increases and new assessments.
operating expenses cost of service. cost of service increased 10.5% during fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the variable costs associated with revenue growth and an increase in amortization expense associated with our acquisitions of apt and paypros. as a percentage of revenue, cost of service increased to 37.3% for fiscal year 2014 from 36.3% in the prior year.
sales, general and administrative expenses. sales, general and administrative expenses increased 7.5% during fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in commission payments to isos, incremental costs related to our acquisitions of apt and paypros, acceleration of equity awards and other costs associated with the retirement of our former chairman and chief executive officer and charges related to employee termination benefits. as a percentage of revenues, sales, general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at 47.1% for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013.
processing system intrusion. during fiscal 2014, we recorded a credit of $7.0 million related to insurance recoveries associated with our processing system intrusion, bringing our total insurance recoveries recognized to date to $27.0 million. we do not expect any additional recoveries. during fiscal 2013, we recorded a $36.8 million charge related to the incident. since our identification of the intrusion in march 2012, we have incurred approximately $114.2 million of cumulative expenses, net of insurance recoveries, relating to the incident.
operating income and operating margin for segments north america merchant services segment. operating income in north america merchant services segment increased 5.2% to $272.3 million for fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year. the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increases in transactions and volume in our u.s. direct channels as well as growth in canada. this increase was partially offset by amortization and other incremental costs associated with our acquisitions of apt and paypros and foreign currency translation in canada. the operating margin was 15.0% and 15.2% for the fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.
international merchant services segment. operating income in international merchant services segment increased 13.7% to $240.2 million for fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year. the increase in operating income was driven primarily by increased transactions and volume in europe and the asia-pacific region as well as pricing increases in the asia-pacific region. the operating margin was 32.2% and 31.5% for the fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.
corporate. our corporate expenses decreased 5.3% to $106.9 million for fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due a decrease in one-time costs associated with the processing system intrusion partially offset by higher data security expenses and
share-based compensation expense. corporate operating expenses includes a processing system intrusion credit of $7.0 million for fiscal 2014 and a charge of $36.8 million for fiscal 2013.
operating income during fiscal 2014, our consolidated operating income increased 13.5% to $405.5 million from $357.2 million in the prior year. the increase was primarily due to revenue growth in our north america and international merchant services segments offset by (i) higher variable costs of services associated with revenue growth, (ii) higher amortization and other incremental costs associated with acquisitions, (iii) higher data security expenses and (iv) acceleration of equity awards and other costs associated with the retirement of our former chairman and chief executive officer, and charges related to employee termination benefits. operating income also reflects the adjustments from the processing system intrusion credit of $7.0 million and charge of $36.8 million for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively.
other income/expense, net other expense, net, increased to $28.1 million for fiscal 2014 compared to $22.9 million in the prior year. the increase is primarily due to a $8.2 million increase in interest expense associated with debt and the loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.1 million that we recorded in connection with the refinancing of our term loan and revolving credit facility; offset by a $5.1 million reduction in the amount of dividends paid to hsbc asia related to a redeemable noncontrolling interest that hsbc asia held in global payments asia-pacific. such dividends are reflected as interest expense in our consolidated statements of income in accordance with the provisions of asc 480. please see note 4 - business and intangible asset acquisition and joint ventures - redeemable noncontrolling interest acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates were 28.5% and 28.6% for the years ended may 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the effective tax rates for the years ended may 31, 2014 and 2013 reflect adjustments to our u.k. deferred tax asset due to corporate tax rate reductions in the united kingdom of 3% and 2%, respectively. our effective tax rates differ from u.s. statutory rates due to domestic and international tax planning initiatives and income generated in lower tax jurisdictions due to international expansion.
the following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended may 31, 2013 and 2012, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2012.

revenues for fiscal 2013, revenues increased 7.8% to $2,375.9 million compared to the prior year. this growth was primarily driven by our u.s. iso channel, growth from our direct sales channels and gaming business, and growth in europe; partially offset by market-based pricing compression in canada.
north america merchant services segment. for fiscal 2013, revenue from our north america merchant services segment increased 8.8% compared to $1,705.7 million. north america revenue growth was driven by our u.s. iso channel, strong growth from our direct sales channels, gaming business and reduced interchange expense due to recently enacted legislation.
in fiscal 2013, we grew our u.s. revenue primarily by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, largely through our iso channel. for fiscal 2013, our u.s. direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 11.2% compared to the prior year. increased spreads offset the impact of a lower average ticket price, which decreased by 0.9% in fiscal 2013. this
for fiscal 2013, our canadian revenue decreased 6.4% to $311.0 million while our credit and debit card processed transactions grew 3.2% compared to the prior year. the decrease in revenue was due to ongoing market-based pricing compression.
international merchant services segment. for fiscal 2013, international merchant services revenue increased 5.3% to $670.2 million compared to the prior year. our europe merchant services revenue for fiscal 2013 increased 6.8% to $522.6 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by strong transaction growth in all markets. asia-pacific merchant services revenue of $147.7 million was flat for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year resulting from a slight decrease of 0.8% in the number of credit and debit card processed transactions.
operating expenses cost of service. cost of service increased 9.9% during fiscal 2013, compared to the prior year primarily driven by revenue growth. as a percentage of revenue, cost of service increased to 36.3% for fiscal year 2013 from 35.6% in the prior year.
sales, general and administrative expenses. sales, general and administrative expenses increased 9.0% for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. in addition, as a percentage of revenues, sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 47.1% for fiscal 2013 from 46.6% in the prior year. these increases were primarily due to an increase in commission payments to isos and costs associated with our start up operations in brazil. these increases were somewhat offset by the elimination of iso commission payments previously made to apt as a result of our acquisition of apt on october 1, 2012.
processing system intrusion. during the fiscal year ended may 31, 2013, we recorded $36.8 million of expense associated with the processing system intrusion described above, bringing the life-to-date total expense to $121.2 million as of may 31, 2013. of this life-to-date expense, $105.5 million represented costs incurred through may 31, 2013 for professional fees and other costs associated with the investigation and remediation, incentive payments to certain business partners and costs associated with credit monitoring and identity protection insurance. an additional $35.7 million represented total fraud losses, fines and other charges that have been imposed upon us by the card networks. we also recorded $20.0 million of insurance recoveries. during fiscal 2013, we reduced our accrual for fraud losses, fines and other charges by $31.8 million. we based our initial estimate of fraud losses, fines and other charges on our understanding of the rules and operating regulations published by the networks and preliminary communications with the networks. we subsequently reached resolution with and made payments to the networks, resulting in charges that were less than our initial estimates. the primary difference between our initial estimates and the final charges relates to lower fraud related costs attributed to this event than previously expected. as of may 31, 2013, we had received $20.0 million in insurance recoveries related to the intrusion.
operating income and operating margin for segments north america merchant services segment. operating income in the north america merchant services segment decreased 8.0% for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. the decrease in operating income was primarily due to market-based pricing compression in canada. the operating margin was 15.2% and 17.9% for the fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by the iso channel, including the impact of the durbin amendment, canadian spread compression and costs associated with our start up operation in brazil. these increases were somewhat offset by the elimination of iso commission payments previously made to apt as a result of our acquisition of apt on october 1, 2012. the iso channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the isos.
effective october 1, 2011, the debit interchange legislation capped the amount of interchange that card issuers may charge on transactions. our interchange expenses decreased as a result of this. we recognize revenue net of interchange expense; therefore, our revenues increased as a result of lower interchange expense with a resulting increase in operating income as well. increased revenues came primarily through our iso channel, where reduced interchange fees led to higher revenues and a dollar-for-dollar increase in iso commission expense, with an associated reduction in our operating margin.
international merchant services segment. operating income in the international merchant services segment increased 7.7% to $211.2 million for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. the operating margin was 31.5% and 30.8% for the fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in operating margin in our international merchant services segment was due to strong results in europe, partially offset by last year's marketing fee true-up in spain, whereby caixabank compensated us for favorable pricing to certain caixabank customers during the initial phase of our marketing alliance agreement.
corporate. our corporate costs decreased 33.6% to $112.9 million for fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. this decrease was primarily due to lower costs associated with the processing system intrusion and charges related to two contractual disputes in fiscal 2012.
operating income during fiscal 2013, our consolidated operating income increased $49.9 million to $357.2 million from $307.3 million in the prior year. the increase in our consolidated operating income was primarily due to solid financial results in north america and europe and lower costs associated with the processing system intrusion in fiscal 2013 compared to 2012.
other income/expense, net other expense, net, increased to $22.9 million for fiscal 2013 compared to $6.9 million in the prior year period. the increase was due to higher debt balances as well as an $8.4 million distribution to hsbc asia in fiscal 2013. this distribution was characterized as interest expense in accordance with the provisions of asc 480. please see note 4 - business and intangible asset acquisition and joint ventures - redeemable noncontrolling interest acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates were 28.6% and 27.6% for the years ended may 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effective tax rates for the years ended may 31, 2013 and 2012 reflect adjustments to our u.k. deferred tax asset due to enacted corporate tax rate reductions in the united kingdom of 2% in each year. our effective tax rates differ from u.s. statutory rates due to domestic and international tax planning initiatives and the increasing amount of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions due to international expansion.
noncontrolling interests, net of tax noncontrolling interests, net of tax decreased to $22.6 million from $29.4 million for the fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively. this decrease was primarily due to the fact that we stopped attributing income to the gpap redeemable noncontrolling interest subsequent to july 26, 2012, the date of our agreement to purchase hsbc asia's interest.
liquidity and capital resources a significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows. cash flow from operations is used to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, and to pay down debt and repurchase shares of our common stock at the discretion of our board of directors. accumulated cash balances are invested in high quality and marketable short-term instruments.
our capital plan objectives are to support the company's operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while maintaining a low cost of capital. lines of credit are used in certain of our markets to fund settlement and, along with other bank financing, to fund acquisitions. we regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise.
at may 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $581.9 million. of this amount, we consider $304.3 million to be available cash. our available cash balance includes $174.7 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are considered permanently reinvested for u.s. tax purposes. these cash balances reflect our capital investments in these subsidiaries and the accumulation of cash flows generated by each subsidiary's operations, net of cash flows used to service debt locally and fund
non-u.s. acquisitions. we believe that we are able to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for our domestic operations and commitments without repatriation of the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries. if we were to repatriate some or all of the cash held by such foreign subsidiaries, we do not believe that the associated income tax liabilities would have a significant impact on our liquidity.
available cash excludes settlement related and merchant reserve cash balances. settlement related cash balances represent funds that we hold on behalf of our member sponsors when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the member sponsors' funding obligation to the merchant. settlement related cash balances are not restricted; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day. merchant reserve cash balances represent funds collected from our merchants that serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement ("merchant reserves"). at may 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents included $124.7 million related to merchant reserves. while this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash to collateralize merchant reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks.
operating activities provided net cash of $194.1 million during fiscal 2014 compared to net cash of $240.5 million during the prior year. the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the change in net settlement processing assets and obligations of $137.4 million, which is generally driven by the timing of month end cut-off, offset by an increase in operating income and favorable changes in prepaid expenses and accrued liabilities resulting from the absence in fiscal 2014 of payments associated with the processing system intrusion.
net cash used in investing activities decreased from $528.6 million in the prior year to $501.7 million in fiscal 2014, primarily due to a reduction in capital expenditures for data center infrastructure and our authorization platform.
for fiscal 2014, financing activities provided net cash of $218.9 million compared to $183.5 million in the prior year. on february 28, 2014, we closed a five-year senior unsecured $1,250.0 million term loan facility, paid off previously existing debt of 902.5 million and paid fees and expenses of 6.0 million. in connection with the debt refinancing, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured $1,000.0 million revolving credit facility under which we borrowed $140.0 million during the remainder of fiscal 2014. in addition, we made net borrowings of $252.7 million on short-term lines of credit used to fund settlement-related activities, and we spent $447.3 million to repurchase shares of our common stock.
in the prior year, we borrowed $700.0 million under a five-year unsecured term loan facility of which we repaid $52.5 million during fiscal 2013. in addition, we made net payments of $27.9 million on short-term lines of credit used to fund settlement-related activities. finally, we invested $242.0 million to purchase hsbc asia's 44% interest in gpap and $175.3 million to repurchase shares of our common stock during fiscal 2013.
we believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. during fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $95.0 million.
long-term debt and credit facilities as of may 31, 2014 and 2013, outstanding debt consisted of the following:
lines of credit:                                                      (in thousands)
corporate credit facility - long-term        $140,000                  $309,955
short-term lines of credit                    440,128                   187,461
total lines of credit                         580,128                   497,416
maturity requirements on outstanding debt by fiscal years are as follows (in thousands):
on february 28, 2014, we entered into an amended and restated term loan agreement ("term loan") and an amended and restated credit agreement ("corporate credit facility") with a syndicate of financial institutions. the term loan and the corporate credit facility amended and restated the term loan agreement dated september 28, 2012 and the credit agreement dated december 7, 2010, respectively.
the term loan is a five-year senior unsecured $1,250.0 million term loan. we used proceeds from the term loan to partially fund our acquisition of paypros on march 4, 2014 and to repay the outstanding balances on our previously existing revolving credit facility and our previously existing term loan.
the term loan expires february 28, 2019 and bears interest, at our election, at either libor or a base rate, in each case plus a leverage-based margin. as of may 31, 2014, the interest rate on the term loan was 1.62%. commencing in may 2015 and ending in november 2018, the term loan has scheduled quarterly principal payments of 1.25%, increasing up to 2.50%. at maturity, 27.50% of the term loan will have been repaid through scheduled amortization and the remaining principal balance will be due. with notice, the term loan may be voluntarily prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without penalty. as of may 31, 2014, the outstanding balance of the term loan was $1,250.0 million.
the corporate credit facility is a five-year senior unsecured revolving $1,000.0 million revolving credit facility. the corporate credit facility expires february 28, 2019 and bears interest, at our election, at either libor or a base rate, in each case plus a leverage-based margin. borrowing under the corporate credit facility is available in various currencies. as of may 31, 2014, the outstanding balance of the corporate credit facility was $140.0 million, and the interest rate was 1.6%. the corporate credit facility is available for general corporate purposes.
the corporate credit facility allows us to issue standby letters of credit of up to $100.0 million in the aggregate. outstanding letters of credit under the corporate credit facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. at may 31, 2014, we had standby
letters of credit of $8.1 million. the total available incremental borrowings under our corporate credit facility at may 31, 2014 was $851.9 million. the corporate credit facility is included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because we are not contractually obligated to make repayments in the next twelve months.
upon closing of the term loan and the corporate credit facility, which occurred on february 28, 2014, we repaid the outstanding balance of $612.5 million on our previously existing term loan and the outstanding balance of $290.0 million on our previously existing revolving credit facility together with accrued interest and fees on each. in connection with the debt refinancing, we recorded a loss of $2.1 million, representing the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the previously existing term loan. we reported this loss in interest and other expense in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal year ended may 31, 2014. we incurred fees and expenses associated with these new arrangements of approximately $6.0 million, which was capitalized as debt issuance costs. debt issuance costs are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet at may 31, 2014 and are being amortized over the term of these new arrangements.
the agreements contain customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. please see "compliance with covenants" below. each of the agreements includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable cure period, would permit lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations to be immediately due and payable.
short-term lines of credit we have short-term lines of credit with banks in the united states and canada as well as several countries in europe and asia in which we do business. the short-term lines of credit, which are primarily used to fund settlement, generally have variable short-term interest rates and are subject to annual review. the credit facilities are generally denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. for certain of our lines of credit, the line of credit balance is reduced by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender when determining compliance with the credit limit. accordingly, the line of credit balance may exceed the stated credit limit at any given point in time, when in fact the combined position is less than the credit limit.
as of may 31, 2014 and may 31, 2013, respectively, we had $440.1 million and $187.5 million outstanding under these short-term lines of credit, with additional borrowing capacity as of may 31, 2014 of $818.5 million to fund settlement. during the year ended may 31, 2014, the maximum and average borrowings under our lines of credit were $1,000.5 million and $551.6 million, respectively. the weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was 1.7% and 2.1% at may 31, 2014 and may 31, 2013, respectively. our maximum borrowed amount was greater than our average and period end borrowings due to the timing of settlement funding.
notes payable united card services, our subsidiary in the russian federation, had notes payable with a total outstanding balance of approximately $3.7 million at may 31, 2014. these notes had fixed annual interest rates of 8.5% with maturity dates ranging from june 2014 through november 2018.
compliance with covenants there are certain financial and non-financial covenants contained in our various credit facilities and term loan. our term loan and corporate credit facility agreements include financial covenants requiring (i) a leverage ratio no greater than 3.50 to 1.00 and (ii) a fixed charge coverage ratio no less than 2.50 to 1.00. we complied with all applicable covenants as of and for the year ended may 31, 2014.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee products described under "critical accounting estimates" below.
bin/ica agreements we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks. these agreements allow us to use the banks' identification numbers, referred to as bank identification number ("bin") for visa transactions and interbank card association ("ica") number for mastercard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard. certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of may 31, 2014.
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of may 31, 2014:
the table above excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, unrecognized tax benefits, and other current and long-term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. at this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of these payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. we do not have any material purchase commitments as of may 31, 2014.
critical accounting policies in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. in many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. we refer to accounting estimates of this type as "critical accounting estimates." the critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements.
accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. you should read the following in conjunction with note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in "item 1a - risk factors" of this annual report.
reserve for operating losses as a part of our direct merchant credit card and debit card processing services and check guarantee services, we experience merchant losses and check guarantee losses, which we collectively refer to as "operating losses." merchant losses occur when we are unable to collect amounts from merchant customers for any charges properly reversed by the issuing bank. check guarantee losses occur when we are unable to collect the full amount of a guaranteed check from the checkwriter. please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of these operating losses.
we process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the issuing bank. in the event,
however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. we require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. we have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults.
we record reserves for our estimated liability for operating losses. this estimate of losses is comprised of estimated known losses and estimated incurred but not reported losses. estimated known losses arise from specific instances of, for example, merchant bankruptcies, closures or fraud of which we are aware at the balance sheet date, but for which the ultimate amount of associated loss will not be determined until after the balance sheet date. estimated known loss accruals are recorded when it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss is reasonably estimable. estimated known losses are calculated at the merchant level based on chargebacks received to date, processed volume, and historical chargeback ratios. the estimate is reduced for any collateral that we hold. accruals for estimated known losses are evaluated periodically and adjusted as appropriate based on actual loss experience. incurred but not reported losses result from transactions that we process before the balance sheet date for which we have not yet received chargeback notification. we estimate incurred but not reported losses by applying historical loss ratios to our direct merchant credit card and signature debit card sales volumes processed, or processed volume. historically, this estimation process has been materially accurate.
for the years ended may 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, our processed volume was $201.2 billion, $192.8 billion, and $180.7 billion, respectively. for these same periods, we recorded provisions for merchant losses of $8.7 million, $9.5 million, and $8.8 million, respectively. as a percentage of processed volume, these charges were 0.0043%, 0.0049%, and 0.0049%, respectively, during the above periods. for these same years, we experienced actual losses of $9.3 million, $9.5 million, and $9.6 million, respectively. we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. a 10% increase or decrease in our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for the year ended may 31, 2014 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.6 million. further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal 2014 had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume of 0.0049% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decreased by $0.9 million. as of may 31, 2014 and 2013, $1.7 million and $2.3 million respectively has been recorded for guarantees associated with merchant card processing and are included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
in our check guarantee service offering, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter's bank. we have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. our check guarantee loss reserve is comprised of estimated losses on returned checks and estimated incurred but not reported losses.  we estimate the loss on returned checks by applying historical collection rates to our claims receivable balance.  we estimate incurred but not reported losses by applying historical loss ratios to the face value of our guaranteed checks.  for each of the years ended may 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we guaranteed total check face values of $2.6 billion. for those same periods, we recorded provisions for check guarantee losses of $11.9 million, $11.7 million, and $13.4 million, respectively. as a percentage of the total guaranteed check face value, these charges were 0.46%, 0.44%, and 0.51%, respectively. for these same years, we experienced actual losses of $12.1 million, $12.0 million, and $13.8 million, respectively. we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. a 10% increase or decrease in our percentage assumption for the year ended may 31, 2014 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.8 million. further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal 2014 had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume of 0.44% for the same prior year period, our net income would have increased by $0.2 million. as of may 31, 2014 and 2013, we had a check guarantee reserve of $3.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
we derive our projected loss rate assumptions primarily based on a rolling six to twelve month analysis of historic loss activity. these assumptions, however, bear the risk of change, which may occur as a result of several qualitative factors. for merchant losses, these factors include the following: a change in the creditworthiness of our merchant customers; a change in the levels of credit card fraud affecting our merchant customers; and a change in the effectiveness of our internal credit, risk management, and collection departments. for check guarantee losses, these factors include a change in the levels of dishonored consumer checks presented to our guarantee service merchant customers and a change in the effectiveness of our internal check guarantee procedures, customer acceptance and retention policies, or collection protocols. application of our percentage assumptions involve uncertainty regarding changes in any of the factors above, especially those that are outside of our control, such as the financial health of the economies in
the united states, canada, the united kingdom, spain, the asia-pacific region and the russian federation at a regional or national level and the related impact on our customers.
goodwill and long-lived asset valuations goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. we test goodwill for impairment annually as of january 1st and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net carrying value. we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. the option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made from year-to-year and can vary by reporting unit.
as of january 1, 2014, we elected to apply the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment guidance in asc 350-20, goodwill, for each of our reporting units. factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of our reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying value of the net assets of our reporting units, sustained decrease in our share price, and other relevant entity specific events. if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value, a two-step quantitative test is required. in the first step, the reporting unit's carrying amount, including goodwill, is compared to its fair value. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed. step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit (including unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. the excess of the fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the goodwill. the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value of the goodwill is the impairment loss.
we have six reporting units: north america merchant services, u.k. merchant services, asia-pacific merchant services, central and eastern europe merchant services, russia merchant services and spain merchant services. based on our annual assessment as of january 1, 2014, we determined on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair values of the reporting units were not more likely than not less than their respective carrying values; and therefore, a two-step quantitative test was not required. we believe that the fair values of our reporting units are substantially in excess of their carrying values.
our goodwill impairment testing involves the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment on the part of management. our assessment of the qualitative factors discussed above involves significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions. significant changes in our assessment of such qualitative factors could affect our assessment of the fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
other intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), acquired technology and trademarks associated with acquisitions. customer-related intangible assets, contract-based intangible assets and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives of from 5 to 30 years. the useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. the useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. the useful lives of amortizable trademarks are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks in the applicable markets. acquired technology is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
amortization for most of our customer-related intangible assets is calculated using an accelerated method. in determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. we multiply that percentage by the initial carrying value of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates, we will adjust the amortization schedule accordingly. these cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business. during fiscal 2014, we did not adjust the amortization schedules.
we believe that our accelerated method better approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships. we use the straight-line method of amortization for our contract-based intangibles and amortizable trademarks.
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may not be recoverable. when factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable. we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets may warrant revision. in our opinion, the carrying values of our long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets, were not impaired at may 31, 2014 and 2013.
capitalization of internally developed software we develop software that is used in providing processing services to customers. capitalization of internally developed software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. the preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. currently unforeseen circumstances in software development, such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used, obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition, could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. such impairment would result in a charge to income. total software capitalized at may 31, 2014 was $224.8 million. costs capitalized during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $39.1 million, $29.2 million, and $31.3 million, respectively. internally developed software has an amortization period of 5 to 10 years. internally developed software assets are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use.
as of may 31, 2014, we have placed into service $96.7 million of hardware and software associated with our authorization platform, $6.1 million of which was placed in service during fiscal 2014. the vision for this platform is to serve as a front-end operating environment for merchant processing and is intended to replace a number of legacy platforms that have higher cost structures. depreciation and amortization associated with these costs is calculated based on transactions expected to be processed over the life of the platform. we believe that this method is more representative of the platform's use than the straight-line method. we are currently processing transactions on this authorization platform in nine markets in our asia-pacific region and for a limited number of u.s. merchants. as these markets represent a small percentage of our overall transactions, depreciation and amortization related to this platform for fiscal 2014 was not significant. depreciation and amortization expense will increase as we complete migrations of other merchants to this authorization platform.
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires management's judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. we believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we establish liabilities for material tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related liability. when facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change.
judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. to the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets are adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made. at may 31, 2014, our consolidated balance sheet includes net deferred tax assets associated with our united kingdom business of $96.7 million. our assessment of the recoverability of these deferred tax assets is based, in part, on our projections of future business performance and viable tax planning strategies. if future business performance fails to meet projections, we may determine that some or all of these deferred tax assets
will not be realized. in the event of such a determination, we would record a valuation allowance for the amount deemed unrecoverable with a corresponding charge to the provision for income taxes.
new accounting pronouncements from time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, our management believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update ("asu") 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers(topic 606)." the core principle of the asu is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. the asu requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. early application is not permitted. we are evaluating the impact of this asu on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-08, "presentation of financial statements (topic 205) and property, plant, and equipment (topic 360) reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity." the amendments in asu 2014-11change the requirements for reporting discontinued operations in asc 205-20. the amendments change the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. the amendments require expanded disclosures for discontinued operations and are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2014. early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or classifications as "held for sale") that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance.
in july 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-11, "presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists" ("asu 2013-11"). the amendments in asu 2013-11 require an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss ("nol") carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward except when: (1) a nol carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available as of the reporting date under the governing tax law to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position; or (2) the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose (provided that the tax law permits a choice). if either of these conditions exists, an entity should present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset. the amendment does not affect the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions under asc 740-5. the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013. the amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date. retrospective application is permitted.
in march 2013, the fasb issued asu 2013-05, "foreign currency matters" ("asu 2013-05"). the amendments in asu 2013-05 resolve the diversity in practice about whether current literature applies to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. in addition, the amendments in asu 2013-05 resolve the diversity in practice for the treatment of business combinations achieved in stages (sometimes also referred to as step acquisitions) involving a foreign entity. asu 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2013.

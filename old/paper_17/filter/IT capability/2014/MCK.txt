item 1a.   risk factors the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material. the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.
changes in the united states healthcare industry and regulatory environment could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
many of our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently being used in the united states. in recent years, the healthcare industry in the united states has changed significantly in an effort to reduce costs. these changes have included cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement levels, increases in the use of managed care, consolidation of pharmaceutical and medical-surgical supply distributors and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. we expect the healthcare industry in the united states to continue to change and for healthcare delivery models to evolve in the future.
changes in the healthcare industry's or our pharmaceutical suppliers' pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. due to the diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services that we offer, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, while not affecting some of our competitors who offer a narrower range of products and services.
the majority of our u.s. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements with manufacturers are structured to ensure that we are appropriately and predictably compensated for the services we provide; however, failure to successfully renew these contracts in a timely and favorable manner could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, branded pharmaceutical price inflation can be the partial economic basis of some of our distribution business agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. if the frequency or rate of branded price increases slows, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
mckesson corporation in addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which can be subject to both price deflation and price inflation. in recent years, our financial results have improved from our generic drug offerings combined with an increase in the number of generic drugs available in the marketplace. in fiscal year 2016, we anticipate the number of branded to generics conversions to increase as compared to the prior year. continued volatility in the availability, pricing trends or reimbursement of these generic drugs, or significant fluctuations in the rate of increase in the number of generic drugs, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
generic drug manufacturers are increasingly challenging the validity or enforceability of patents on branded pharmaceutical products. during the pendency of these legal challenges, a generics manufacturer may begin manufacturing and selling a generic version of the branded product prior to the final resolution of its legal challenge over the branded product's patent. to the extent we source, contract manufacture, and distribute such generic products, the brand-name company could assert infringement claims against us. while we generally obtain indemnification against such claims from generic manufacturers as a condition of distributing their products, there can be no assurances that these rights will be adequate or sufficient to protect us.
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and further regulation of our distribution businesses and technology-related products and services could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins, and the profit margins of our customers, delay the introduction or implementation of our new products, or otherwise negatively impact our business and expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations.
healthcare fraud:  we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse. local, state and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving fraud, waste and abuse affecting medicare, medicaid and other government healthcare programs. our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical-surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which among other things: (1) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare, medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs; (2) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs; and (3) prohibit the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, and knowing retention of an overpayment by, a federal healthcare program such as medicare and medicaid. many of the regulations applicable to us, including those relating to marketing incentives, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. the regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could become liable for damages and suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare, medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.
reimbursements: both our profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical treatments and related services, or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. for example, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act (collectively the "affordable care act"), signed into law in 2010, revised the federal upper limits for medicaid reimbursement for multiple source generic drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175% of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly average manufacturer price ("amp") using a smoothing process. the centers for medicare and medicaid services ("cms") has proposed new rules for calculating amp ("revised amp") and is also offering states the option to replace traditional reimbursement metrics for certain drugs with alternatives such as the average acquisition cost ("aac") method or the national average drug acquisition cost benchmark ("nadac"). under aac and nadac, reimbursement is based on the actual acquisition costs from invoiced amounts and from a statistically validated cost of dispensing survey. states will have the option of using any of these metrics to determine appropriate medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies for generic or brand drugs. we expect that the use of a revised amp benchmark or the use of an alternative reimbursement metric, such as aac or nadac, would result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain pharmaceuticals, which could indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers and cause corresponding declines in our profitability.
mckesson corporation the federal government may adopt measures that could reduce medicare and/or medicaid spending, or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities. for example, under the terms of the budget control act of 2011, an automatic 2% reduction of medicare program payments for all healthcare providers became generally effective for services provided on or after april 1, 2013. this automatic reduction is known as "sequestration." medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of average sales price ("asp") plus 6%. the implementation of sequestration pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6% level for the duration of sequestration (which lasts through fiscal 2024 in the absence of additional legislation). as another example, the medicare access and chip reauthorization act ("macra"), signed into law in april 2015, seeks to reform medicare reimbursement policy for physician fee schedule services and adopts a series of policy changes affecting a wide range of providers and suppliers. most notably, macra repeals the statutory sustainable growth rate formula, which has called for cuts in medicare rates in recent years, but which congress routinely stepped in to override the full application of the formula. instead, after a period of stable payment updates, macra links physician payment updates to quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models. macra also extends certain expiring medicare and other health policy provisions, including extending the children's health insurance program. additionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit and national debt levels could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the medicare program, or both. we cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives or medicare payment reductions, if any, will ultimately be enacted into law, or the timing or affect any such initiatives or reductions will have on us.
operating, security and licensure standards:  we are subject to the operating and security standards of the drug enforcement administration ("dea"), the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda"), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the u.s. department of health and human services ("hhs"), the cms and other comparable agencies. certain of our businesses may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of the dea, fda, hhs, cms, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as foreign agencies and certain accrediting bodies, depending upon the type of operations and location of product development, manufacture, distribution, and sale. for example, we are required to hold valid dea and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and distribution of controlled substances.
as part of these operating, security and licensure standards, we regularly receive requests for information and occasionally subpoenas from government authorities. in some instances, these can lead to monetary penalties and/or license revocation. in march 2015, we reached an agreement in principle with the dea and department of justice pursuant to which we agreed to pay the sum of $150 million to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company's suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances.
although we have enhanced our procedures to ensure compliance, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain without significant delay future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
pedigree tracking: there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. in november 2013, congress passed and the president signed into law the drug quality and security act ("dqsa"). the dqsa establishes federal standards requiring supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable, lot-level prescription drug track and trace system. the law also preempts state drug pedigree requirements.
in addition, the food and drug administration amendments act of 2007, which went into effect on october 1, 2007, requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. these standards may include track-and-trace or authentication technologies, such as radio frequency identification devices and other similar technologies. on march 26, 2010, the fda released the serialized numerical identifier ("sni") guidance for manufacturers who serialize pharmaceutical packaging. we expect to be able to accommodate these sni regulations in our distribution operations. the dqsa and other pedigree tracking laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
mckesson corporation privacy: state, federal and foreign laws regulate the confidentiality of personal information, how that information may be used, and the circumstances under which such information may be released. these regulations govern the disclosure and use of confidential personal and patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified privacy and security measures. regulations currently in place, including regulations governing electronic health data transmissions, continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. although we modified our policies, procedures and systems to comply with the current requirements of applicable state, federal and foreign laws, including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ("hipaa") and the health information technology for economic and clinical health ("hitech") act portion of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, new laws and regulations in this area could further restrict our or our customers' ability to obtain, use or disseminate personal or patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products or systems in a timely manner, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, the hitech act expanded hipaa privacy and security requirements and increased financial penalties for violations. it also extended certain provisions of the federal privacy and security standards to us in our capacity as a business associate of our payer and provider customer. these standards may be interpreted by a regulatory authority in a manner that could require us to make a material change to our operations. furthermore, our failure to maintain the confidentiality of personal information in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements could expose us to breach of contract claims, tort damages, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.
healthcare reform:    the affordable care act significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates. we do not currently anticipate that the affordable care act or any resulting federal and state healthcare reforms will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. however, given the scope of the changes made and under consideration, as well as the uncertainties associated with implementation of healthcare reforms, we cannot predict their full effect on the company at this time.
interoperability and meaningful use requirement:  there is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare software and systems provided by various vendors be compatible with each other. in 2013, in order to address this demand for interoperability we and a number of other healthcare it companies co-founded the commonwell health alliance with the aim of developing a standard for data sharing among doctors, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. certain federal and state agencies also are developing standards that could become mandatory for software and systems purchased by these agencies, or used by our customers. with respect to legislation addressing interoperability, macra promotes and defines interoperability, requires metrics to measure interoperability, and requires vendors and providers to attest that they are not blocking data. regarding meaningful use requirements, the hitech act requires meaningful use of "certified" healthcare information technology products by healthcare providers in order to receive stimulus funds from the federal government.
although several of our healthcare information technology products have received certification, rules regarding meaningful use may be changed or supplemented in the future. as a result of interoperability and meaningful requirements, we may incur increased development costs and delays in receiving certification for our products, and changing or supplementing rules also may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle. we also may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. to the extent these requirements subsequently are changed or supplemented, or we are delayed in receiving certification for our products, customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement these products.
fda regulation of medical software:  the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the federal food, drug and cosmetic act. for example, in 2011 the fda issued a rule on medical device data systems that regulates certain software systems that electronically store, transfer or display data originating from medical devices as class 1 medical devices (i.e., those devices deemed by the fda to be low risk and subject to the least regulatory controls) themselves. however, in february 2015, the fda issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems, medical image storage devices, and medical image communication devices. if the fda chooses to regulate more of our products as medical devices, or subsequently changes or reverses its guidance regarding not enforcing regulatory controls for certain medical device products, it can impose extensive requirements upon us. if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements, the fda could respond by imposing fines, injunctions or civil penalties, requiring recalls or product corrections, suspending production, refusing to grant pre-market clearance of products, withdrawing clearances and initiating criminal prosecution. any additional fda regulations governing health information technology products, once issued, may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products.
mckesson corporation standards for submission of healthcare claims: hhs previously adopted two rules that impact healthcare claims submitted for reimbursement. the first rule modifies the standards for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from version 4010/4010a to version 5010. the second rule updated and expanded the standard medical code sets for diagnosis and procedure coding from international classification of diseases, ninth revision ("icd-9") to international classification of diseases, tenth revision ("icd-10"). as a consequence of the passage of the protecting access to medicare act of 2014, the compliance date for icd-10 conversion has been postponed from october 1, 2014 to october 1, 2015. updating systems to version 5010 for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) is required for use of the icd-10 code set. generally, claims submitted not using version 5010 and icd-10 when required will not be processed, and health plans not accepting transactions using version 5010 and icd-10 may experience significant increases in customer service inquiries. we may incur increased development costs and delays in delivering solutions and upgrading our software and systems to be in compliance with these new rules. in addition, these rules may lengthen our sales and implementation cycle and we may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. delays in providing software and systems that are in compliance with the new rules may result in postponement or cancellation of our customers' decisions to purchase our software and systems.
medical billing and coding: medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws. in connection with these laws, we may be subjected to federal or state government investigations and possible penalties may be imposed upon us, false claims actions may have to be defended, private payers may file claims against us and we may be excluded from medicare, medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. any such proceeding or investigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
our foreign operations subject us to a number of operating, economic, political and regulatory risks that may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
we have operations based in, and we source and contract manufacture pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products in, a number of foreign countries. the company's acquisition of celesio significantly increases the importance of our foreign operations to our future operations and growth.
our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks including changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; changes in licensing regimes for pharmacies; unexpected regulatory, social, political, or economic changes in a specific country or region; changes in intellectual property, privacy and data protection; import/export regulations and trade sanctions in both the united states and foreign countries and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. political changes, labor strikes, acts of war or terrorism and natural disasters, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location. we may also be affected by potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad.
foreign operations are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. the u.k. bribery act, for example, prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both private and public sectors. an organization that fails to prevent bribery committed by anyone associated with the organization can be charged under the u.k. bribery act unless the organization can establish the defense of having implemented adequate procedures to prevent bribery. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
we also may experience difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including but not limited to: (1) difficulties in complying with the requirements of applicable federal, state and local governmental authorities in the united states and of foreign regulatory authorities; (2) inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand or the failure to predict market demand; (3) other manufacturing or distribution problems including changes in types of products produced, limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, physical limitations, or scarce or inadequate resources that could impact continuous supply; and (4) damage to our reputation due to real or perceived quality issues. for example, the fda has conducted investigations and banned certain generics manufacturers from selling certain raw materials and drug ingredients in the u.s. from overseas plants due to quality issues. difficulties in manufacturing or access to raw materials could result in production shutdowns, product shortages and other similar delays in product manufacturing that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
provincial governments in canada provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs. similar to the united states, provincial governments in canada have introduced significant changes in recent years in an effort to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. for example, in 2006, the government of ontario considerably revised the drug reimbursement system with the passage of the transparent drug system for patients act. in recent years, to reduce the cost for taxpayers, provincial governments have taken further steps to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs. these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, the elimination or reduction of professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. these reforms may adversely affect the distribution of drugs as well as the pricing for prescription drugs for the company's operations in canada. other provinces have implemented or are considering similar changes, which would also lower pharmaceutical pricing and service fees. individually or in combination, such changes in the canadian healthcare environment may significantly reduce our canadian revenue and operating profit.
general european economic conditions, together with austerity measures being taken by certain european governments, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
the company's acquisition of celesio increased our assets and operations within europe and, accordingly, our exposure to economic conditions in europe. a slowdown within the european economy could affect our business in europe by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services. a slowdown may also reduce the demand for our products, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
in addition, in many european countries the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. in recent years, in response to the recessionary environment and financial crisis in europe, a number of european governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending and constrain overall government expenditures. for example, in 2011, the french government introduced a new wholesale mark-up system that constrained distribution margins on pharmaceuticals. these measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services and reduce the prices they are willing to pay.
countries with existing healthcare-related austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. in addition, european governments that have not yet imposed healthcare-related austerity measures may impose them in the future. new austerity measures may be similar to or vary from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
in europe, we are subject to the european union ("eu") data protection regulations, including the eu directive on data protection, which requires member states to impose minimum restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the united states. we may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. the eu regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data, including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security. in addition to this eu-wide legislation, certain member states have adopted more stringent data protection standards. the company has addressed these requirements by certification to the u.s.-eu safe harbor frameworks. the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
as all of celesio's revenues are generated outside of the united states, the company's acquisition of celesio significantly increases our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risks. these risks include uncertainty regarding the brazilian real, the british pound sterling, the canadian dollar, the euro, and the norwegian krone that could adversely impact our results of operations and capital ratios based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the u.s. dollar. fluctuating exchange rates cause the value of items on both the assets and liabilities side of the balance sheet to change, which could also negatively impact our results of operations. our financial results and capital ratios will therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. a depreciation of non-u.s. dollar currencies relative to the u.s. dollar could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
our business could be hindered if we are unable to complete and integrate acquisitions successfully.
an element of our strategy is to identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions that either expand or complement our business. integration of acquisitions involves a number of significant risks, including the diversion of management's attention to the assimilation of the operations of businesses we have acquired; difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; the realization of potential operating synergies; the assimilation and retention of the personnel of the acquired companies; accounting, regulatory or compliance issues that could arise, including internal control over financial reporting; challenges in retaining the customers of the combined businesses. further, acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our operating results if unanticipated expenses or charges to earnings were to occur, including unanticipated depreciation and amortization expenses over the useful lives of certain assets acquired, as well as costs related to potential impairment charges, assumed litigation and unknown liabilities. in addition, we may potentially require additional financing in order to fund future acquisitions, which may or may not be attainable and is subject to potential volatility in the credit markets. if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected.
on february 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of celesio and certain convertible bonds of celesio. upon the acquisition, our ownership of celesio's fully diluted shares was 75.6%. celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. on december 2, 2014, we obtained the ability to pursue the integration of the two companies upon the effectiveness of the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the "domination agreement").
achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of celesio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including foreign exchange fluctuations, challenges of managing new international operations, and whether we can ensure continued performance or market growth of celesio's product and services. the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized or, if realized, the timing of its realization. it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated, and could result in the loss of employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses, processes and systems, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition and which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.
any significant diversion of management's attention away from the ongoing businesses, and any difficulties encountered in the acquisition, transition and integration process, could adversely affect our financial results. moreover, the failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the celesio acquisition could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and could adversely affect our future business, financial position and operating results. events outside of our control, including the market price of celesio shares that we did not acquire in the acquisition, changes in regulations and laws, as well as economic trends, could also adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits from our acquisition of celesio.
mckesson corporation our business and results of operations could be impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures.
we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives. for example, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business and a small business from our distribution solutions segment, as well as a small business from our technology solutions segment. when we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. we may also experience greater dissynergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. after reaching an agreement with a buyer, we are subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the sale. dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
we are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
from time-to-time and in the ordinary course of our business, we and certain of our subsidiaries may become involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings involving false claims, healthcare fraud and abuse, antitrust, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, licensing, tort and other various claims. all such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary payments. in some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. for some complaints filed against the company, we are currently unable to estimate the amount of possible losses that might be incurred should these legal proceedings be resolved against the company.
the outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain and outcomes that are not justified by the evidence or existing law can occur. the company believes that it has valid defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is defending itself vigorously. nevertheless, it is possible that resolution of one or any combination of more than one legal matter could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.
litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. the defense of these matters could also result in continued diversion of our management's time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. even if these matters are not resolved against us, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation.
competition may erode our profit.
in every area of healthcare distribution operations, our distribution solutions segment faces strong competition, both in price and service, from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. in addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. price, quality of service, and in some cases, convenience to the customer are generally the principal competitive elements in this segment.
in recent years, pharmaceutical suppliers have been subject to increasing consolidation. as a result, a small number of very large companies control a significant share of the market. accordingly, we depend on fewer suppliers for our products and therefore we may be less able to negotiate price terms with suppliers. many healthcare organizations that purchase our products and services have also consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power. if this consolidation trend continues, it could reduce the number of market participants and give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products and services. in addition, when healthcare organizations combine they often consolidate infrastructure including it systems, which in turn may erode the diversity of our customer and revenue base.
our technology solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many firms, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. these competitive pressures could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
mckesson corporation a material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer or group purchasing organization, as well as substantial defaults in payment by a large customer or group purchasing organization, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
in recent years, a significant portion of our revenue growth has been with a limited number of large customers. during 2015, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our largest customer, cvs caremark corporation ("cvs"), accounted for approximately 15% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2015, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 36% of total trade accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs were approximately 14% of total trade accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. we also have agreements with group purchasing organizations ("gpos"), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. a material default in payment, change in our customer mix, reduction in purchases, or the loss of a large customer or gpo could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
we generally sell our products and services to customers on credit that is short-term in nature and unsecured. any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely reduce sales to our customers, affect consumer buying practices or cause our customers to delay or be unable to pay accounts receivable owed to us, which may in turn materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a material decrease in our profitability and cash flow. further, interest rate fluctuations and changes in capital market conditions may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their business under acceptable terms, which in turn may materially reduce our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability.
contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance.
contracts with foreign and domestic government entities and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by various government authorities. government contracts also are exposed to uncertainties associated with funding. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. as a result, our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
in addition, because government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, we must comply with such requirements. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, and the cost accounting standards. we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts.
we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable government regulations. these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies.
if we violate these rules or regulations, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed by a government including disallowance of costs claimed, monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work. the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
mckesson corporation our future results could be materially affected by a number of public health issues whether occurring in the united states or abroad.
public health issues, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or customers, or have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels that would negatively affect our suppliers and customers. we have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, and we will continue to update these plans as necessary. however, there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative impact of any such diseases on the company's operating results. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information, financial information and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. we also rely on sophisticated information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: (1) facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; (2) receive, process and ship orders and handle other product and services on a timely basis; (3) manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and (4) process payments to suppliers. in europe, celesio outsources a significant part of its it infrastructure to an external service provider. if these systems are interrupted, damaged or breached by an unforeseen event or actions of a third party, including a cyber attack, or fail for any extended period of time, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
if we sustain cyber attacks or other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches, we could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences.
we routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. some of the data we process, store and transmit may be outside of the u.s. due to our information technology systems and international business operations. we may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. our systems and the data we store on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks; acts of vandalism or theft; coordinated attacks by activist entities; misplaced or lost data; human errors; or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our customer's data.
the costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers. in addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties, could expose our customers' private information and our customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business.
we could experience losses or liability not covered by insurance.
in order to provide prompt and complete service to our major distribution solutions segment's customers, we maintain significant product inventory at certain of our distribution centers. while we seek to maintain property insurance coverage in amounts sufficient for our business, there can be no assurance that our property insurance will be adequate or available on acceptable terms. one or more large casualty losses caused by fire, earthquake or other natural disaster in excess of our coverage limits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
mckesson corporation our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution, manufacturing, dispensing and administration of pharmaceuticals and medical-surgical supplies, the provision of ancillary services, the conduct of our payer businesses (which include care management programs and our nurse advice services) and the provision of products that assist clinical decision-making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans. if customers or individuals assert liability claims against our products and/or services, any ensuing litigation, regardless of outcome, could result in a substantial cost to us, divert management's attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products. we attempt to limit our liability to customers by contract; however, the limitations of liability set forth in the contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a patient. we also maintain general liability coverage; however, this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and may include larger self-insured retentions or exclusions for certain products. in addition, the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim. a successful product or professional liability claim not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
the acquisition of celesio exposes us to additional risks related to providing pharmacy services. pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions, labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit drugs and expiration of drugs. although celesio maintains liability insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to protect us against future claims. if celesio's insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or celesio suffers reputational harm as a result of an error or omission, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
the failure of our healthcare technology businesses to attract and retain customers due to challenges in software product integration or to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our results of operations.
our healthcare technology businesses, the bulk of which resides in our technology solutions segment, deliver enterprise‐wide and single entity clinical, patient care, financial, supply chain and strategic management software solutions to hospitals, physicians, homecare providers, retail and mail order pharmacies and payers. challenges integrating software products could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and a disproportionate impact on the results of operations of our technology solutions segment.
future advances in the healthcare information systems industry could lead to new technologies, products or services that are competitive with the technology products and services offered by our various businesses. such technological advances could also lower the cost of such products and services or otherwise result in competitive pricing pressure or render our products obsolete.
the success of our technology businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to be responsive to technological developments, pricing pressures and changing business models. to remain competitive in the evolving healthcare information systems marketplace, our technology businesses must also develop new products on a timely basis. the failure to develop competitive products and to introduce new products on a timely basis could curtail the ability of our technology businesses to attract and retain customers, and thereby could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
we rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and solutions. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop products or solutions that are equivalent or superior to ours. in addition, despite protective measures, we may be subject to unauthorized use of our technology due to copying, reverse-engineering or other infringement. although we believe that our products, solutions and services do not infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, from time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. if we were found to be infringing others' rights, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards and forced to develop non-infringing products or technology, obtain a license or cease selling or using the products that contain the infringing elements. additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our patent, copyright and trademark rights and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. these types of litigation can be costly and time consuming. these litigation expenses, damage payments or costs of developing replacement products or technology could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
mckesson corporation system errors or failures of our products to conform to specifications could cause unforeseen liabilities or injury, harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
the software and technology services that we sell or operate are complex. as with complex systems offered by others, our software and technology services may contain errors, especially when first introduced. for example, our technology solutions segment's systems are intended to provide information to healthcare professionals in the course of delivering patient care. therefore, users of our software and technology services have a greater sensitivity to errors than the general market for software products. if our software and technology services lead to faulty clinical decisions or injury to patients, we could be subject to claims or litigation by our clients, clinicians or patients. in addition, such failures could damage our reputation and could negatively affect future sales.
failure of a customer's system to perform in accordance with our documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and could require us to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation. if such failure is not remedied in a timely manner, it could constitute a material breach under a contract, allowing the client to cancel the contract, obtain refunds of amounts previously paid or assert claims for significant damages.
we provide remote hosting services that involve operating both our software and the software of third-party vendors for our customers. the ability to access the systems and the data that we host and support on demand is critical to our customers. our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from a number of sources, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: (1) power loss and telecommunications failures; (2) fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters; (3) software and hardware errors, failures or crashes; and (4) cyber attacks, computer viruses, hacking and other similar disruptive problems. we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means including disaster recovery plans, separate test systems and change controls, information security procedures, and continued development and enhancement of our cyber security, but our precautions may not protect against all risks. if customers' access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities, we could be exposed to significant claims, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of medical care. if customers' access is interrupted from failure or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our contractors or third party service providers, we could suffer reputational harm or be exposed to liabilities arising from the unauthorized and improper use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. we must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers of related services and if those vendors fail us at a time that our center is not operating correctly, we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual service commitments. any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services.
many of the solutions offered by our technology solutions segment have long sales and implementation cycles, which could range from a few months to two years or more from initial contact with the customer to completion of implementation. how and when to implement, replace, or expand an information system, or modify or add business processes, are major decisions for healthcare organizations. many of the solutions we provide typically require significant capital expenditures and time commitments by the customer. any decision by our customers to delay or cancel implementation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. furthermore, delays or failures to meet milestones established in our agreements may result in a breach of contract, termination of the agreement, damages and/or penalties as well as a reduction in our margins or a delay in our ability to recognize revenue.
we are required under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") to test our goodwill for impairment, annually or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry, or economic trends or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. in addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as a divestiture indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value. we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. there are inherent uncertainties in management's estimates, judgments and assumptions used in assessing recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge.
tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions. as such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. from time-to-time, legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect our tax positions. there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in legislation. for example, if legislation is passed to repeal the lifo (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, it would adversely impact our cash flow. additionally, if legislation is passed to change the current u.s. taxation treatment of income from foreign operations, or if legislation is passed at the state level to establish or increase taxation on the basis of our gross revenues, it may adversely impact our tax expense. the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where we have major operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. for example, we operate in various countries which collect value added taxes ("vat"). the determination of the manner in which a vat applies to our foreign operations is subject to varying interpretations arising from the complex nature of the tax laws and regulations. although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expense in defending challenges to our tax positions by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
volatility and disruption to the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit, our cost of credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers.
volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of certain financial institutions, reduced lending activity by other financial institutions, decreased liquidity and increased costs in the commercial paper market and the reduced market for securitizations, may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit already arranged and the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future, including any arrangements to renew or replace our current credit or financing arrangements. although we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets, current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit and sales facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.
our business could also be negatively impacted if our customers or suppliers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase or implement our products or services and suppliers may increase their prices, reduce their output or change their terms of sale. additionally, if customers' or suppliers' operating and financial performance deteriorates or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of accounts receivable owed to us and suppliers may restrict credit, impose different payment terms or be unable to make payments due to us for fees, returned products or incentives. any inability of customers to pay us for our products and services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow.
our financial statements are subject to the application of u.s. gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. within our financial statements, we consolidate the results of celesio, which are subject to the application of international financial reporting standards or ifrs. from time-to-time we or celesio are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the fasb, iasb and the sec. it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.
we could face significant liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate or one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities.
we participate in various multiemployer pension plans. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make additional cash contributions to the plans in installments. our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. the multiemployer plans could have significant unfunded vested liabilities. such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. in addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to our february 2014 acquisition of celesio ag ("celesio") and february 2013 acquisition of pss world medical, inc. ("pssi"), as well as due to market growth and our mix of business. market growth reflects growing drug utilization, which includes newly launched drugs and price increases. increases in revenues were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions.
gross profit and gross profit margin increased over the last two years primarily due to our business acquisitions, higher buy margin and our mix of business, partially offset by a decrease in sell margin. additionally, gross profit was impacted by higher lifo-related inventory charges which were $337 million, $311 million and $13 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
operating expenses increased over the last two years primarily due to our business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and higher intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs. operating expenses in 2015 also included a pre-tax and after-tax $150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims with the drug enforcement administration ("dea"), department of justice ("doj") and various u.s. attorney's offices, and in 2014 and 2013 operating expenses included $68 million and $72 million of charges associated with our average wholesale price ("awp") litigation. additionally, operating expenses for 2013 were favorably impacted by an $81 million non-cash gain on a business combination related to our purchase of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building.
income from continuing operations before income taxes increased over the last two years reflecting higher gross profit, partially offset by higher operating and interest expenses. interest expense increased in 2015 primarily due to our acquisition of celesio. additionally, income from continuing operations in 2013 included a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $191 million associated with the sale of our 49% equity interest in nadro, s.a. de c.v ("nadro"). the impairment reduced the investment's carrying value to its estimated fair value. nadro was sold in 2014 with no material gain or loss on disposition.
our reported income tax rates were 30.7%, 34.9% and 30.1% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. income tax expense for 2014 included a charge of $122 million relating to our litigation with the canadian revenue agency ("cra").
during the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business which we acquired through our acquisition of celesio. financial results for this business have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2015 includes $241 million pre-tax ($235 million after-tax) non-cash impairment charges to write-off the business' long-lived assets and reduce the carrying value of this business to its fair value, less costs to sell.
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2015 primarily reflects the $62 million of guaranteed dividends and recurring compensation that mckesson is obligated to pay the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the "domination agreement"), which became effective in december 2014 as further described below.
on february 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of celesio and certain convertible bonds of celesio for cash consideration of $4.5 billion, net of cash acquired (the "acquisition"). upon the acquisition, as required, we consolidated celesio's debt with a fair value of $2.3 billion as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet and our ownership of celesio's fully diluted common shares was 75.6%. we owned approximately 75.4% of celesio's outstanding and fully diluted common shares at march 31, 2014. financial results for celesio are included within our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our distribution solutions segment, since the date of acquisition.
on may 22, 2014, celesio and mckesson, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, mckesson deutschland gmbh & co. kgaa ("mckesson deutschland," formerly known as dragonfly gmbh & co. kgaa), entered into the domination agreement. on july 15, 2014, the domination agreement was approved at the general shareholders' meeting of celesio. on december 2, 2014, the domination agreement became effective upon its registration in the commercial register of celesio at the local court of stuttgart, germany. upon the effectiveness of the domination agreement, the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio no longer participate in their percentage ownership of celesio's profits and losses. instead, mckesson became obligated to pay a one-time $50 million dividend ("guaranteed dividend") for their fiscal year ended december 31, 2014, and an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per celesio share (effective january 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio. the recurring compensation amount is recognized ratably during the applicable annual period. for fiscal 2016, the estimated annual recurring compensation is $44 million based on the euro to u.s. dollar exchange rate and shares owned by the noncontrolling interests at april 1, 2015.
in addition, upon effectiveness of the domination agreement, the noncontrolling interests in celesio became redeemable as a result of a put right. accordingly, the carrying value of noncontrolling interests related to celesio of $1.5 billion was reclassified in the third quarter of 2015 from "total equity" to "redeemable noncontrolling interests" on our consolidated balance sheet. the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests will be reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. at march 31, 2015, the carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests amounted to $1.4 billion, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.2 billion.
distribution solutions north america pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth and our mix of business. market growth reflects growing drug utilization, which includes newly launched drugs and price increases. in particular, our 2015 revenues benefited from newly launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis c. these increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversions.
medical-surgical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth. additionally, revenues increased in 2014 as a result of our february 2013 acquisition of pssi.
technology solutions technology solutions revenues decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decline in software products and services revenues, the planned elimination of a product line and lower revenues from the workforce business within our international technology business, which we will transition to another service provider during the first quarter of 2016. these decreases were partially offset by higher volume in our transaction processing businesses.
technology solutions revenues increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to small business acquisitions and higher volumes in our transaction processing businesses, partially offset by a decrease in software products and services revenues.

(1)   gross profit for our distribution solutions segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes lifo-related inventory charges of $337 million, $311 million and $13 million.
consolidated gross profit and gross profit margin increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to an increase in our distribution solutions segment.
distribution solutions distribution solutions gross profit margin increased over the last two years primarily reflecting our business acquisitions and higher buy margin within our north american distribution business, partially offset by a decrease in sell margin primarily driven by higher sales volume, and an increase in lifo-related inventory charges. buy margin primarily reflects volume and timing of compensation we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers. gross profit margin for 2015 was also unfavorably affected by the increased sales associated with newly launched drugs for the treatment of hepatitis c. gross profit margin for 2014 was also favorably affected by growth in sales of higher margin generic drugs.
our lifo-related inventory expense was $337 million in 2015, $311 million in 2014 and $13 million in 2013. our north american distribution business uses the lifo method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. the business' practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. our annual lifo expense is affected by expected changes in year-end inventory quantities, product mix and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be influenced by market and other external influences. changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual lifo expense.
as a result of cumulative net price deflation, at march 31, 2013, pharmaceutical inventories at lifo were $60 million more than market and, accordingly, a $60 million lower-of-cost or market ("lcm") reserve reduced inventories to market. in 2015 and 2014, we experienced net inflation in our pharmaceutical inventories and lifo-related charges were incurred, and in 2014, the $60 million lcm reserve was fully released resulting in an increase in gross profit. as of march 31, 2015 and 2014, pharmaceutical inventories at lifo did not exceed market. additional information regarding our lifo accounting is included under the caption "critical accounting policies and estimates," included in this financial review.
technology solutions technology solutions gross profit margin decreased in 2015 primarily due to a $34 million pre-tax charge representing a catch-up in depreciation and amortization expense not recognized in 2014 when certain assets were classified as held-for-sale and our mix of business. these decreases were partially offset by the planned elimination of a product line and lower product alignment charges. gross profit margin increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to growth in higher margin revenues, partially offset by higher product alignment charges.
in 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our international technology and hospital automation businesses from our technology solutions segment. as required, we classified the results of operations and cash flows of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements in 2014 and depreciation and amortization expense was not recognized as the assets were held-for-sale.  during the first quarter of 2015, we decided to retain the workforce business within our international technology business. as a result, we reclassified the workforce business, which had been designated as a discontinued operation during 2014, as a continuing operation for all periods presented. additionally, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $34 million as a catch-up of depreciation and amortization expense not recognized in 2014 when the assets were classified as held-for-sale.
in 2014, the segment recorded pre-tax charges totaling $57 million.  these charges primarily consisted of $35 million of product alignment charges, $15 million of integration-related expenses and $7 million of reduction-in-workforce severance charges.  included in the total charge was $35 million for severance for employees primarily in our research and development, customer services and sales functions, and $15 million for asset impairments which primarily represents the write-off of deferred costs for a product that will no longer be developed.  charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as follows: $34 million in cost of sales and $23 million in operating expenses.
in 2013, this segment recorded $46 million of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges. these charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. the charge included a $36 million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value. in addition, the goodwill had a nominal tax basis. this impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations. the balance of the charge represents a $10 million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value. we concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. this impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations.
operating expenses increased over the last two years primarily due to our distribution solutions segment, which includes our celesio and pssi business acquisitions.
distribution solutions distribution solutions segment's operating expenses and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to our business acquisitions, including increases in acquisition-related expenses and higher intangible asset amortization, and higher compensation and benefit costs. operating expenses in 2015 also included a pre-tax and after-tax $150 million charge associated with the settlement of controlled substance distribution claims with the dea, doj and various u.s. attorney's offices, and 2014 and 2013 operating expenses included $68 million and $72 million of charges associated with our awp litigation. additionally, operating expenses for 2013 were negatively impacted by a $40 million charge for a legal dispute in our canadian business.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, the company reached an agreement in principle with the dea, doj and various u.s. attorney's offices to settle all potential administrative and civil claims relating to investigations about the company's suspicious order reporting practices for controlled substances. the global settlement with the dea and doj is subject to the execution of final settlement agreements.  under the terms of the agreement in principle, the company has agreed to pay the sum of $150 million, implement certain remedial measures and the suspension of four distribution centers' dea registrations for the specified products and time periods. accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a pre-tax and after-tax charge of $150 million in operating expenses within our distribution solutions segment. refer to financial note 23, "other commitments and contingent liabilities," to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10-k for further information on the controlled substance distribution claim and the awp litigation matter.
the segment's operating expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to small business acquisitions, integration-related expenses, reduction-in-workforce severance charges, and continued investment in research and development activities. these increases were partially offset by a $36 million goodwill impairment charge incurred in 2013. the segment's operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in revenue.
corporate corporate expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs and asset impairments, partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses and lower costs associated with corporate initiatives. corporate expenses increased in 2014 primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs and higher acquisition-related expenses. additionally, 2013 corporate expenses include a non-cash pre-tax gain of $81 million gain ($51 million after-tax) related to our purchase of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in san francisco, california.
acquisition expenses and related adjustments acquisition expenses and related adjustments, which include transaction and integration expenses that are directly related to acquisitions by the company and gains and losses related to business combinations were $224 million, $218 million and $1 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. expenses for 2015 and 2014 primarily related to our acquisitions and integrations of celesio and pssi. additionally, expenses for 2013 include an $81 million pre-tax gain on business combination resulting from our acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building.
total acquisition expenses and related adjustments      $224              $218              $1
acquisition expenses and related adjustments by segment were as follows:
total acquisition expenses and related adjustments      $224              $218              $1
during 2015 and 2014, we incurred $109 million and $129 million of acquisition-related expenses for our acquisition of celesio. during 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $110 million, $68 million and $55 million in acquisition-related expenses for our acquisition of pssi. these expenses primarily include restructuring, severance and relocation expenses, employee retention incentives, outside service fees and other costs to integrate the business, and bridge loan fees. additionally, our acquisition-related expenses for our pssi acquisition include amounts associated with distribution center rationalization and information technology conversions to common platforms.
amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets purchased in connection with acquisitions recorded in operating expenses were $483 million, $308 million and $196 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. the increases in amortization expense primarily reflect our business acquisitions.
other income, net increased for 2015 from 2014 primarily due to our celesio acquisition including higher equity investment income. additionally, 2014 other income, net included a loss on a foreign exchange option relating to our acquisition of celesio.
impairment of an equity investment:
in 2013, we committed to a plan to sell our 49% equity interest in nadro, s.a. de c.v. ("nadro") and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $191 million reducing the investment's carrying value to its estimated fair value. the charge was recorded in impairment of an equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations within our distribution solutions segment. in september 2013, we completed the sale of our equity interest in nadro. under the terms of the agreement, we received $41 million in total cash consideration resulting in no material gain or loss.

(1)   segment operating profit includes gross profit, net of operating expenses, plus other income (loss), net, for our two operating segments.
segment operating profit:
distribution solutions: operating profit increased over the last two years primarily reflecting growth in our business and our business acquisitions. operating profit margin for 2015 decreased from 2014 primarily due to our acquisition of celesio and the unfavorable impact from the newly launched drugs for hepatitis c, partially offset by our other mix of business. operating profit margin in 2014 was flat compared to 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in gross profit margin and the $191 million impairment charge on an equity investment incurred in 2013, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, which included the effects of our acquisitions. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, operating profit and operating profit margin were also impacted by $150 million, $68 million and $72 million of reserve adjustments for estimated probable losses related to our controlled substance distribution claims and average wholesale price litigation.
technology solutions: operating profit decreased slightly in 2015 and increased in 2014 compared to the prior years. operating profit margin increased in 2015 primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin. operating profit margin increased in 2014 primarily due to an increase in gross profit margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, operating profit and operating profit margin were impacted by $34 million, $57 million and $46 million of charges associated with a depreciation and amortization catch-up related to the prior year, and product alignment and impairment charges.
interest expense: interest expense increased over the last two years primarily due to the march 2014 issuance of $4.1 billion of new debt to fund the acquisition of celesio and due to interest on celesio's debt. interest expense for 2014 also included $46 million of bridge loan fees associated with the initial funding of the acquisition of celesio. partially offsetting these increases, interest expense benefited from the repayment of term debt in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt that is repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred for bridge loan fees. refer to our discussion under the caption "credit resources" within this financial review for additional information regarding our financing activities.
income taxes our reported income tax rates were 30.7%, 34.9% and 30.1% in 2015, 2014 and 2013. fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to changes within our business mix, including varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have lower income tax rates and discrete items. income tax expense included net discrete tax benefits of $33 million in 2015, net discrete tax expenses of $94 million in 2014 and net discrete tax benefits of $29 million in 2013. discrete tax expense for 2014 primarily related to a $122 million charge regarding an unfavorable decision from the tax court of canada with respect to transfer pricing issues.
we have received reassessments from the canada revenue agency ("cra") related to a transfer pricing matter impacting years 2003 through 2010, and have filed notices of appeal to the tax court of canada for all of these years. on december 13, 2013, the tax court of canada dismissed our appeal of the 2003 reassessment and we have filed a notice of appeal to the federal court of appeal regarding this tax year. after the close of 2015, we reached an agreement in principle with the cra to settle the transfer pricing matter for years 2003 through 2010. since the agreement in principle did not occur within 2015, we have not reflected this potential settlement in our 2015 financial statements. we will record the final settlement amount in a subsequent quarter and do not expect it to have a material impact to income tax expense.
during 2015, we reached an agreement with the internal revenue service ("irs") to settle all outstanding issues relating to years 2003 through 2006 and recognized discrete tax benefits of $55 million to record previously unrecognized tax benefits and related interest.
during the fourth quarter of 2015, we committed to a plan to sell our brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business and a small business from our distribution solutions segment, as well as a small business from our technology solutions segment. as a result, we recorded $241 million pre-tax ($235 million after-tax) non-cash impairment charges to write off the business' long‐lived assets and reduce the carrying value of the brazilian business to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell.  the ultimate loss from the sale of the business may be higher or lower than our current assessment of the business' fair value.
in 2014, we committed to a plan to sell our international technology and our hospital automation businesses from our technology solutions segment and certain businesses from our distribution solutions segment.  as a result, we recorded a pre-tax and after-tax $80 million non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the international technology business to its estimated fair value, less cost to sell. a portion of this business was sold in 2015 for nominal proceeds. our hospital automation business was sold in 2014 for net cash proceeds of $55 million which approximated the business' net book value.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2015 primarily represents the $50 million guaranteed dividend and $12 million associated with the quarterly accrual of the annual recurring compensation that we are obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of celesio under the domination agreement.  net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2014 primarily represents the portion of celesio's net loss that was not allocable to mckesson corporation.
foreign operations foreign operations accounted for approximately 20%, 11% and 8% of 2015, 2014 and 2013 consolidated revenues. foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. we monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. additional information regarding our foreign operations is also included in financial note 26, "segments of business," to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k.
on february 6, 2014, we completed the acquisition of 77.6% of the then outstanding common shares of celesio ag ("celesio") and certain convertible bonds of celesio for cash consideration of $4.5 billion, net of cash acquired (the "acquisition"). upon the acquisition, our ownership of celesio's fully diluted common shares was 75.6% and, as required, we consolidated celesio's debt with a fair value of $2.3 billion as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. at march 31, 2014, we owned approximately 75.4% of celesio's outstanding and fully diluted common shares. the acquisition was funded by utilizing a senior bridge loan, our existing accounts receivable sales facility and cash on hand. celesio is an international wholesale and retail company and a provider of logistics and services to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors. celesio's headquarters is in stuttgart, germany and it operates in 14 countries around the world. the acquisition of celesio expands our global geographic area; the combined company will be one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the healthcare sector worldwide. financial results for celesio are included within our international pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our distribution solutions segment, since the date of the acquisition.
in addition to our april 2012 acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our corporate headquarters building located in san francisco, california, on february 22, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of pssi for $29.00 per share plus the assumption of pssi's debt, or approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate, consisting of cash consideration of $1.3 billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of long-term debt with a fair value of $0.6 billion. the cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of long-term debt. pssi markets and distributes medical products and services throughout the united states. the acquisition of pssi expanded our existing medical-surgical business. financial results for pssi since the acquisition date are included in the results of operations within our medical-surgical distribution and services business, which is part of our distribution solutions segment.
during the last three years, we also completed a number of other smaller acquisitions within both of our operating segments. financial results for our business acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. purchase prices for our business acquisitions have been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.
goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. however, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes. the pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions and the results of operations for these acquisitions since the acquisition date have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis.
refer to financial notes 2 and 15, "business combinations" and "debt and financing activities," to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.
2016 outlook information regarding the company's 2016 outlook is contained in our form 8-k dated may 12, 2015. this form 8-k should be read in conjunction with the sections item 1 - business - forward-looking statements and item 1a - risk factors in part 1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. other accounting policies are described in financial note 1, "significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k. because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.
allowance for doubtful accounts: we provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. we also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. we estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes portfolio and specific reserves, the company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. if the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers' financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. as a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. during 2015, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of our total consolidated revenues. sales to our largest customer, cvs caremark corporation ("cvs"), accounted for approximately 15% of our total consolidated revenues. at march 31, 2015, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 36% of total trade accounts receivable. accounts receivable from cvs were approximately 14% of total trade accounts receivable. as a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. a default in payments, a material reduction in purchases from these, or any other large customer or the loss of a large customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. in addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. we believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2015 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. at this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in the foreseeable future in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue.
at march 31, 2015, trade and notes receivables were $13,275 million prior to allowances of $141 million. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, our provision for bad debts was $67 million, $36 million and $28 million. at march 31, 2015 and 2014, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.1% and 0.9%. an increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2015 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $13 million. the selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios. additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in schedule ii included in this annual report on form 10-k.
inventories: we report inventories at the lower of cost or market ("lcm"). inventories for our distribution solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. for our distribution solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the lifo method. the majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the first-in, first-out method ("fifo"). technology solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. total inventories were $14.3 billion and $13.0 billion at march 31, 2015 and 2014.
the lifo method was used to value approximately 73% and 67% of our inventories at march 31, 2015 and 2014. if we had used the fifo method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement costs, inventories would have been approximately $768 million and $431 million higher than the amounts reported at march 31, 2015 and 2014. these amounts are equivalent to our lifo reserves. our lifo valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. in 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recognized net lifo expense of $337 million, $311 million and $13 million within our consolidated statements of operations. a lifo expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. a lifo credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.
we believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., "market").  as such, our lifo inventory is valued at the lower of lifo or market.  due to cumulative net price deflation from 2005 to 2013, we had a lower-of-cost or market ("lcm") reserve of $60 million at march 31, 2013 which reduced pharmaceutical inventories at lifo to market.  during 2014, the lcm reserve of $60 million was released, resulting in an increase in gross profit.  as of march 31, 2014 and 2015, inventories at lifo did not exceed market.
in determining whether inventory valuation issues exist, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. we write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. these factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.
business combinations:  we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained of a business, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.
several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. for intangible assets, we typically use the income method. this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. refer to financial note 2, "business combinations," to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
goodwill and intangible assets:  as a result of acquiring businesses, we have $9,817 million and $9,927 million of goodwill at march 31, 2015 and 2014 and $3,441 million and $4,871 million of intangible assets, net at march 31, 2015 and 2014. we maintain goodwill assets on our books unless the assets are considered to be impaired. we perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the company's stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time.
impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a component - one level below our distribution solutions and technology solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.
the first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. if the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary. if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangibles assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test. if the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess.
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. in addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units' fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the discounted cash flow method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. other estimates inherent in both the market and income approaches include long-term growth rates, projected revenues and earnings and cash flow forecasts for the reporting units.
estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations. the valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. any changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, a further deterioration in the market or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. in 2015 and 2014, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. in 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $36 million in our technology solutions segment.
currently, all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to thirty-eight years.  we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.  assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective.  they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. there were no material impairments of intangibles in 2015, 2014 or 2013.  our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.
supplier reserves: we establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. these reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. we evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. as of march 31, 2015 and 2014, supplier reserves were $167 million and $181 million. the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different from our estimate. all of the supplier reserves at march 31, 2015 and 2014 pertain to our distribution solutions segment. an increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at march 31, 2015 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $25 million in 2015. the selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.
income taxes: our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. we review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. in estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. we had deferred income tax assets (net of valuation allowances) of $1,189 million and $1,286 million at march 31, 2015 and 2014 and deferred tax liabilities of $3,791 million and $4,075 million. deferred tax assets primarily consist of timing differences on our compensation and benefit related accruals and net operating loss and credit carryforwards. deferred tax liabilities primarily consist of basis differences for inventory valuation (including inventory valued at lifo) and intangible assets. we established valuation allowances of $229 million and $200 million for 2015 and 2014 against certain deferred tax assets, which primarily relate to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to lifo, our cash flows could be materially impacted.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. these tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. these estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of tax liabilities and related interest. if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. if our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.
loss contingencies: we are subject to various claims, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. when a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. however, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided.
disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. as discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.

the company's board has authorized the repurchase of mckesson's common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase ("asr") programs, or by any combination of such methods. the timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.

during the fourth quarter of 2013, we retired approximately 2 million shares repurchased for $217 million by the company.  the retired shares constitute authorized but unissued shares. we elected to allocate any excess of share repurchase price over par value between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. as such, $195 million was recorded as a decrease to retained earnings.
we believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. however, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.

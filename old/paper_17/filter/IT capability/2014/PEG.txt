item 1a. risk factors the following factors should be considered when reviewing our business. these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or net cash flows and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed elsewhere in this report.
the factors discussed in item 7. md&a may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and affect the market prices for our publicly-traded securities. while we believe that we have identified and discussed the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant.
we are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. changes in regulation can cause significant delays in or materially affect business planning and transactions and can materially increase our costs. regulation affects almost every aspect of our businesses, such as our ability to:
•   obtain fair and timely rate relief-pse&amp;g's retail rates are regulated by the bpu and its wholesale transmission rates are regulated by the ferc. the retail rates for electric and gas distribution services are established in a base rate case and remain in effect until a new base rate case is filed and concluded. in addition, our utility has received approval for several clause recovery mechanisms, some of which provide for recovery of and on the authorized investments. these clause mechanisms require periodic updates to be reviewed and approved by the bpu. our utility's transmission rates are recovered through a ferc-approved formula rate. the revenue requirements are reset each year through this formula. transmission roes have recently become the target of certain state utility commissions, municipal utilities, consumer advocates and consumer groups seeking to lower customer rates in new england and new york. these agencies and groups have filed complaints at the ferc asking the ferc to reduce the base roe of various transmission owners. they point to changes in the capital markets as justification for lowering the roe of these companies. while we are not the subject of any of these complaints, they could set a precedent for ferc-regulated transmission owners, such as pse&amp;g. inability to obtain fair or timely recovery of all our costs, including a return of or on our investments in rates, could have a material adverse impact on our business.
•   obtain required regulatory approvals-the majority of our businesses operate under mbr authority granted by the ferc, which has determined that our subsidiaries do not have unmitigated market power and that mbr rules have been satisfied. failure to maintain mbr eligibility, or the effects of any severe mitigation measures that may be required if market power was evaluated differently in the future, could have a material adverse effect on us.
we may also require various other regulatory approvals to, among other things, buy or sell assets, engage in transactions between our public utility and our other subsidiaries, and, in some cases, enter into financing arrangements, issue securities and allow our subsidiaries to pay dividends. failure to obtain these approvals on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
•   comply with regulatory requirements-there are federal standards, including mandatory nerc and critical infrastructure protection standards, in place to ensure the reliability of the u. s. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system black-outs. we have been, and will continue to be, periodically audited by the nerc for compliance and are subject to penalties for non-compliance with applicable nerc standards.
further, the ferc requires compliance with all of its rules and orders, including rules concerning standards of conduct, market behavior and anti-manipulation rules, reporting, interlocking directorate rules and cross-subsidization.
in addition, power is currently being investigated by the ferc staff with respect to errors in certain of its bids submitted for its fossil-generating units into the pjm market. see item 1. federal regulation-compliance-ferc for further information on this matter.
we are subject to the reporting and record-keeping requirements of the dodd-frank act, as implemented by the cftc, and may in the future be subject to cftc requirements regarding position limits for trading of certain
commodities. as part of the dodd-frank act compliance, we will need to be vigilant in monitoring and reporting our swap transactions.
the bpu conducts periodic combined management/competitive service audits of new jersey utilities related to affiliate standard requirements, competitive services, cross-subsidization, cost allocation and other issues. the bpu is near completion of a combined management audit and affiliate transactions audit of pse&g.
we are exposed to commodity price volatility as a result of our participation in the wholesale energy markets.
the material risks associated with the wholesale energy markets known or currently anticipated that could adversely affect our operations include:
•   price fluctuations and collateral requirements-we expect to meet our supply obligations through a combination of generation and energy purchases. we also enter into derivative and other positions related to our generation assets and supply obligations. as a result, we are subject to the risk of price fluctuations that could affect our future results and impact our liquidity needs. these include:
•   variability in costs, such as changes in the expected price of energy and capacity that we sell into the market,
•   variation in the relative prices of electricity and gas at the hubs within the markets,
•   the cost of fuel to generate electricity, and
•   the cost of emission credits and congestion credits that we use to transmit electricity.
in the markets where we operate, natural gas prices typically have a major impact on the price that generators receive for their output, especially in periods of relatively strong demand. therefore, significant changes in the price of natural gas usually translate into significant changes in the wholesale price of electricity.
over the past few years, wholesale prices for natural gas have declined from the peak levels experienced in 2008. one reason for this decline is increased shale gas production as extraction technology has improved. lower gas prices have resulted in lower electricity prices, which has reduced our margins as nuclear and coal generation costs have not declined similarly. over that time, generation by our coal units was also adversely affected by the relatively lower price of natural gas as compared to coal, making it sometimes more economic to run certain of our gas units than our coal units.
many factors may affect capacity pricing in pjm, including but not limited to:
•   changes in available generating capacity (including retirements, additions, derates, forced outage rates, etc.),
•   increases in transmission capability between zones, and
•   changes to the pricing mechanism, including increasing the potential number of zones to create more pricing sensitivity to changes in supply and demand, as well as other potential changes that pjm may propose over time, including issues currently pending at the ferc regarding compensation for generators that certify their availability during emergency conditions.
as market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, our forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts could require us to post substantial additional collateral, thus requiring us to obtain additional sources of liquidity during periods when our ability to do so may be limited. if power were to lose its investment grade credit rating, it would be required under certain agreements to provide a significant amount of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cash flows. if power had lost its investment grade credit rating as of december 31, 2014, it may have had to provide approximately $945 million in additional collateral.
•   our cost of coal and nuclear fuel may substantially increase-our coal and nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provide a substantial portion of our fuel needs over the next several years. however, it will be necessary to enter into additional arrangements to acquire coal and nuclear fuel in the future. although our fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against these market risks, future increases in our fuel costs cannot be predicted with certainty and could materially and adversely affect liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. while our generation runs on diverse fuels, allowing for flexibility, the mix of fuels ultimately used can impact earnings.
•   third party credit risk-we sell generation output and buy fuel through the execution of bilateral contracts. these contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of our counterparties to meet their contractual obligations to us. any failure to perform by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. in the spot markets, we are exposed to the risks of whatever default mechanisms exist in those markets, some of which attempt to spread the risk across all participants, which may not be an effective way of lessening the severity of the risk of the amounts at stake. the impact of economic conditions may also increase such risk.
we are subject to numerous federal and state environmental laws and regulations that may significantly limit or affect our businesses, adversely impact our business plans or expose us to significant environmental fines and liabilities.
we are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities regarding air quality, water quality, site remediation, land use, waste disposal, aesthetics, impact on global climate, natural resources damages and other matters. these laws and regulations affect the manner in which we conduct our operations and make capital expenditures. future changes may result in significant increases in compliance costs.
delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain and maintain, any environmental permits or approvals, or delay in or failure to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements, could:
•   prevent construction of new facilities,
•   prevent continued operation of existing facilities,
•   prevent the sale of energy from these facilities, or
•   result in significant additional costs, each of which could materially affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.
in obtaining required approvals and maintaining compliance with laws and regulations, we focus on several key environmental issues, including:
•   concerns over global climate change could result in laws and regulations to limit co2 emissions or other ghg produced by our fossil generation facilities-federal and state legislation and regulation designed to address global climate change through the reduction of ghg emissions could materially impact our fossil generation facilities. the current direction in this area is the epa's proposed regulation of existing fossil-fueled generating facilities under the existing source performance standards section of the caa. legislation enacted in the states where our generation facilities are located establishes aggressive goals for the reduction of co2 emissions over a 40-year period. multiple states are developing or have developed state-specific or regional initiatives to obtain co2 emissions reductions in the electric power industry. the rggi is such a program in the northeast. there could be significant costs incurred to continue operation of our fossil generation facilities, including the potential need to purchase co2 emission allowances. such expenditures could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more such facilities.
•   co2 litigation-in addition to legislative and regulatory initiatives, the outcome of certain legal proceedings regarding alleged impacts of global climate change not involving us could be material to the future liability of energy companies. if relevant federal or state common law were to develop that imposed liability upon those that emit ghgs for alleged impacts of ghgs emissions, such potential liability to our fossil generation operations could be material.
•   potential closed-cycle cooling requirements-our salem nuclear generating facility has a permit from the njdep allowing for its continued operation with its existing cooling water system. that permit expired in july 2006. our application to renew the permit, filed in february 2006, estimated the costs associated with cooling towers for salem to be approximately $1 billion, of which our share was approximately $575 million. the renewal filing has not been updated since the 2006 filing.
the epa issued a proposed rule in 2011 regarding regulation of cooling water intake structures. following the receipt of extensive comments on its proposed rule, the epa finalized this rule on may 19, 2014 with an effective date of october 14, 2014. the epa did not mandate closed cycle cooling as the bta. instead, the epa set a fish
impingement mortality standard that relies on a technology-based approach. under this standard, power facilities have the flexibility to select one of several options as their method of compliance. the rule also requires that entrainment bta decisions rely on site-specific analysis that includes an assessment of social costs-social benefits.
the epa has structured the rule so that each state will continue to consider renewal permits for existing power facilities on a case by case basis. in connection with the assessment of the bta of each facility that seeks permit renewal, the rule requires that facilities conduct a wide range of studies related to impingement mortality and entrainment and submit the results with their permit applications. state actions to renew permits under the provisions of this rule are ongoing at this time.
if the njdep or the connecticut department of environmental protection were to require installation of closed-cycle cooling or its equivalent at our salem, mercer, hudson, bridgeport, sewaren or new haven generating stations, the related increased costs and impacts would be material to our financial position, results of operations and net cash flows and would require further economic review to determine whether to continue operations or decommission the stations.
•   remediation of environmental contamination at current or formerly-owned facilities-we are subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. remediation activities associated with our former manufactured gas plant (mgp) operations are one source of such costs. also, we are currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, the related costs of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. new jersey law places affirmative obligations on us to investigate and, if necessary, remediate contaminated property upon which we were in any way responsible for a discharge of hazardous substances, impacting the speed by which we will need to investigate contaminated properties, which could adversely impact cash flow. we cannot predict what further actions, if any, or the costs or the timing thereof, that may be required with respect to these or other natural resource damages claims. however, exposure to natural resource damages could subject us to additional potentially material liability.
approximately half of our total generation output each year is provided by our nuclear fleet, which comprises approximately one-fourth of our total owned generation capacity. for this reason, we are exposed to risks related to the continued successful operation of our nuclear facilities and issues that may adversely affect the nuclear generation industry. these include:
•   storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel-we currently use on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel. disposal of nuclear materials, including the availability or unavailability of a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel, could impact future operations of these stations. in addition, the availability of an off-site repository for spent nuclear fuel may affect our ability to fully decommission our nuclear units in the future.
•   regulatory and legal risk-the nrc may modify, suspend or revoke licenses, or shut down a nuclear facility and impose substantial civil penalties for failure to comply with the atomic energy act, related regulations or the terms and conditions of the licenses for nuclear generating facilities. as with all of our generation facilities, as discussed above, our nuclear facilities are also subject to comprehensive, evolving environmental regulation. our nuclear generating facilities are currently operating under nrc licenses that expire in 2033 through 2046.
•   operational risk-operations at any of our nuclear generating units could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. if this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. since our nuclear fleet provides approximately half of our generation output, any significant outage could result in reduced earnings as we would need to purchase or generate higher-priced energy to meet our contractual obligations.
•   nuclear incident or accident risk-accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred at nuclear stations, both in the united states and elsewhere. the consequences of an accident can be severe and may include loss of life, significant property damage and/or a change in the regulatory climate. we have nuclear units at two sites. it is possible that an accident or other incident at a nuclear generating unit could adversely affect our ability to continue to operate unaffected units located at the same site, which would further affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. an accident or incident at a nuclear unit not owned by us could also affect our ability to continue to operate our units. any resulting financial impact from a nuclear accident may exceed our resources, including insurance coverages. further, as a licensed nuclear operator subject to the price-anderson act and a member of a
we may be adversely affected by changes in energy regulatory policies, including energy and capacity market design rules and developments affecting transmission.
the energy industry continues to be regulated and the rules to which our businesses are subject are always at risk of being changed. our business has been impacted by established rules that create locational capacity markets in each of pjm, iso-ne and nyiso. under these rules, generators located in constrained areas are paid more for their capacity so there is an incentive to locate in those areas where generation capacity is most needed. because much of our generation is located in constrained areas in pjm and iso-ne, the existence of these rules has had a positive impact on our revenues. pjm's locational capacity market design rules and new england forward capacity market rules have been challenged in court and continue to evolve. any changes to these rules may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in january 2011, new jersey enacted a law establishing a lcapp which provided for the construction of subsidized base load or mid-merit electric power generation. the lcapp legislation was invalidated on constitutional grounds by a federal court order issued in october 2013 and a subsequent challenge in the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit upheld that decision. that decision has now been filed with the u.s. supreme court for consideration on appeal. however, future state actions in new jersey and elsewhere to subsidize the construction of new generation could have the effect of artificially depressing prices in the competitive wholesale market on both a short-term and long-term basis.
we could also be impacted by a number of other events, including regulatory or legislative actions, including, among other things, direct and indirect subsidies, favoring non-competitive markets and/or technologies and energy efficiency and demand response initiatives. further, some of the market-based mechanisms in which we participate, including bgs auctions, are at times the subject of review or discussion by some of the participants in the new jersey and federal regulatory and political arenas. we can provide no assurance that these mechanisms will continue to exist in their current form, nor otherwise be modified.
to the extent that additions to the transmission system relieve or reduce congestion in eastern pjm where most of our plants are located, power's capacity and energy revenues could be adversely affected. moreover, through changes encouraged by the ferc to transmission planning processes, or through rto/iso initiatives to change their planning processes, such as the recently accepted multi-driver project category in pjm, more transmission may ultimately be built to facilitate renewable generation or support other public policy initiatives.
the ferc has also eliminated the rofr, which will have the effect of allowing third parties to build certain types of transmission projects in the service territories of incumbent utilities such as pse&g. as a result, we could face competitive pressures for our transmission business in new jersey, as well as in in other utilities' service territories where we will be able to seek opportunities to build. changes to ferc policies regarding transmission planning and rate treatment for transmission investment, including roes and incentive rates, could also have an impact on our transmission business. in addition, certain pjm cost allocation determinations have been recently challenged at the ferc, the resolution of which could impact costs borne by new jersey ratepayers and increase customer bills.
we face significant competition in the merchant energy markets.
our wholesale power and marketing businesses are subject to significant competition that may adversely affect our ability to make investments or sales on favorable terms and achieve our annual objectives. increased competition could contribute to a reduction in prices offered for power and could result in lower earnings. decreased competition could negatively impact results through a decline in market liquidity. some of our competitors include:
•   domestic and multi-national utility rate-based generators,
•   utilities,
•   banks, funds and other financial entities,
regulatory, environmental, industry and other operational developments will have a significant impact on our ability to compete in energy markets, potentially resulting in erosion of our market share and impairment in the value of our power plants.
•   dsm and other efficiency efforts-dsm and other efficiency efforts aimed at changing the quantity and patterns of consumers' usage could result in a reduction in load requirements.
•   changes in technology and/or customer behaviors-it is possible that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity, including distributed generation, such as fuel cells, micro turbines, micro grids, windmills and net-metered pv (solar) cells, to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. large customers, such as universities and hospitals, continue to explore potential micro grid installation. substantial micro grid penetration can impact energy costs, system performance and demand growth. it is also possible that electric customers may significantly decrease their electric consumption due to demand-side energy conservation programs. changes in technology and usage, such as municipal aggregation, could also alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect our financial results. increased reliance by customers on on-site generation, including solar, and changes in customer behaviors can result in decreased reliance on our system and impact our revenues and investment opportunities.
our inability to balance energy obligations with available supply could negatively impact results.
the revenues provided by the operation of our generating stations are subject to market risks that are beyond our control. generation output will either be used to satisfy wholesale contract requirements, other bilateral contracts or be sold into competitive power markets. participants in the competitive power markets are not guaranteed any specified rate of return on their capital investments. generation revenues and results of operations are dependent upon prevailing market prices for energy, capacity, ancillary services and fuel supply in the markets served.
our generation business frequently involves the establishment of forward sale positions in the wholesale energy markets on long-term and short-term bases. to the extent that we have produced or purchased energy in excess of our contracted obligations, a reduction in market prices could reduce profitability. conversely, to the extent that we have contracted obligations in excess of energy we have produced or purchased, an increase in market prices could reduce profitability. if the strategy we utilize to hedge our exposure to these various risks is not effective, we could incur significant losses. our market positions can also be adversely affected by the level of volatility in the energy markets that, in turn, depends on various factors, including weather in various geographical areas, short-term supply and demand imbalances, customer migration and pricing differentials at various geographic locations. these risks cannot be predicted with certainty.
increases in market prices also affect our ability to hedge generation output and fuel requirements as the obligation to post margin increases with increasing prices.
any inability to recover the carrying amount of our assets could result in future impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
in accordance with accounting guidance, management evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate or market conditions, could potentially indicate an asset's or group of assets' carrying amount may not be recoverable. significant reductions in our expected revenues or cash flows for an extended period of time resulting from such events could result in future asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
inability to access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or commercially reasonable terms or maintain sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed could adversely impact our business.
capital for projects and investments has been provided primarily by internally-generated cash flow and external financings. we have significant capital requirements and will need continued access to debt capital from outside sources in order to efficiently fund the construction and other cash flow needs of our businesses. the ability to arrange financing and the costs of capital depend on numerous factors including, among other things, general economic and market conditions, the availability of credit from banks and other financial institutions, investor confidence, the success of current projects and the quality of new projects.
the ability to have continued access to the credit and capital markets at a reasonable economic cost is dependent upon our current and future capital structure, financial performance, our credit ratings and the availability of capital under reasonable terms and conditions. as a result, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in obtaining re-financing for maturing debt or financing for projects and investments.
financial market performance directly affects the asset values of our nuclear decommissioning trust funds and defined benefit plan trust funds. sustained decreases in asset value of trust assets could result in the need for significant additional funding.
the performance of the financial markets will affect the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy our future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans and to decommission our nuclear generating plants. a decline in the market value of our pension assets could result in the need for us to make significant contributions in the future to maintain our funding at sufficient levels.
our results of operations may be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy, including low levels in the market prices of commodities. adverse conditions in the economy affect the markets in which we operate and can negatively impact our results. declines in demand for energy will reduce overall sales and cash flows, especially as customers reduce their consumption of electricity and gas. although our utility business is subject to regulated allowable rates of return, overall declines in electricity and gas sold and/or increases in non-payment of customer bills would materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
we may be adversely affected by equipment failures, accidents, severe weather events or other incidents that impact our ability to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and remain competitive and could result in substantial financial losses.
the success of our businesses is dependent on our ability to continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers while minimizing service disruptions. we are also exposed to the risk of equipment failures, accidents, severe weather events, or other incidents which could result in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons or property. for instance, equipment failures in our natural gas distribution could give rise to a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses. pse&g operates and maintains more than 17,700 miles of distribution mains that transport gas to 1.8 million customers. pse&g also operates and maintains the largest cast iron infrastructure in any one state in the country at approximately 4,000 miles.
in addition, the physical risks of severe weather events, such as experienced from hurricane irene and superstorm sandy, and of climate change, changes in sea level, temperature and precipitation patterns and other related phenomena have further exacerbated these risks. such issues experienced at our facilities, or by others in our industry, could adversely impact our revenues, increase costs to repair and maintain our systems, subject us to potential litigation and/or damage claims and increase the level of oversight of our utility and generation operations and infrastructure through investigations or through the imposition of additional regulatory or legislative requirements. such actions could adversely affect our costs, competitiveness and future investments, which could be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.
our businesses and industry may be impacted by acts and threats of war or terrorism. these actions could result in increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in fuel prices which could materially adversely affect our operations. in addition, our infrastructure facilities, such as our generating stations, transmission and distribution facilities, could be direct or indirect targets or be affected by terrorist or other criminal activity. such events could severely disrupt business operations and prevent us from servicing our customers. in addition, new or updated security regulations may require us to make changes to our current measures which could also result in additional expenses.
cybersecurity attacks or intrusions could adversely impact our businesses.
we own and/or operate generating stations, transmission and distribution facilities, which are dependent on the operation of our computing systems. our ability to market our generation output and acquire and hedge fuel and power are also dependent on our computing systems. our computing systems may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, hostile technological intrusions or inadvertent disclosure of company and/or customer information or a cybersecurity attack may leverage our information technology to cause disruptions at another company. cybersecurity threats to our operations include:
•   general business system and process interruption or compromise, including preventing us from servicing our customers, collecting revenues or the ability to record, process and/or report financial information correctly, and
if a significant cybersecurity event or breach should occur, it could result in material costs for repair and remediation, breach notification, operations and increased capital costs. such a cybersecurity incident could also cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws, regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings, regulatory fines and increased scrutiny and possible damage to our reputation and brand, resulting in a reduction in customer confidence. we devote resources to network and application security, encryption and other measures to protect our computing systems and infrastructure from unauthorized access or misuse and interface with numerous external entities to improve our cybersecurity situational awareness. however, given the ever changing nature of cybersecurity threats, there can be no assurance the steps we take can protect us against all possible occurrences.
inability to successfully develop or construct generation, transmission and distribution projects within budget could adversely impact our businesses.
our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of required environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction and/or acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities and modernizing existing infrastructure. currently, we have several significant projects underway or being contemplated.
our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, complete these projects within budgets, on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and, in our regulated businesses, our ability to recover the related costs through rates. any delays, cost escalations or otherwise unsuccessful construction and development could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
one of the key elements to achieving the results in our business plan is the ability to sustain generating operating performance and capacity factors at expected levels since our forward sales of energy and capacity assume acceptable levels of operating performance. this is especially important at our lower-cost facilities. operations at any of our plants could degrade to the point where the plant has to shut down or operate at less than full capacity. some issues that could impact the operation of our facilities are:
•   disruptions in the transmission of electricity,
•   limitations which may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements,
•   permit limitations, and
identifying and correcting any of these issues may require significant time and expense. depending on the materiality of the issue, we may choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning it to full capacity. in either event, to the extent that our operational targets are not met, we could have to operate higher-cost generation facilities or meet our obligations through higher-cost open market purchases.
challenges associated with retention of a qualified workforce could adversely impact our businesses.
our operations depend on the retention of a skilled workforce. the loss or retirement of key executives or other employees, including those with the specialized knowledge required to support our generation, transmission and distribution operations, could result in various operational challenges. these challenges may include the lack of appropriate replacements, the loss of institutional and industry knowledge and the increased costs to hire and train new personnel. this has the potential to become more critical over the next several years as a growing number of employees become eligible to retire.
in addition, because a significant portion of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements, our success will depend on our ability to successfully renegotiate these agreements as they expire. inability to do so may result in employee strikes or work stoppages which would disrupt our operations and could also result in increased costs.
our receipt of payment of receivables related to our domestic leveraged leases is dependent upon the credit quality and the ability of lessees to meet their obligations.
our receipt of payments of equity rent, debt service and other fees related to our leveraged lease portfolio in accordance with the lease contracts can be impacted by various factors. the factors which may impact future lease cash flow include, but are not limited to, new environmental legislation regarding air quality and other discharges in the process of generating electricity, market prices for fuel and electricity, including the impact of low gas prices on our coal generation investments, overall financial condition of lease counterparties and the quality and condition of assets under lease. if a lessee were to default, we could potentially be required to impair our current investment balances.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
this combined md&a is separately filed by public service enterprise group incorporated (pseg), public service electric and gas company (pse&g) and pseg power llc (power). information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf. pse&g and power each make representations only as to itself and make no representations whatsoever as to any other company.
•   pse&amp;g, our public utility company which primarily provides electric transmission services and distribution of electric energy and natural gas, implements demand response and energy efficiency programs and invests in solar generation in new jersey, and
•   power, our wholesale energy supply company that integrates its nuclear, fossil and renewable generating asset operations with its wholesale energy, fuel supply, energy trading and marketing and risk management activities primarily in the northeast and mid-atlantic united states.
pseg's other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: pseg energy holdings l.l.c. (energy holdings), which earns its revenues primarily from its portfolio of lease investments; pseg long island llc (pseg li), which effective january 1, 2014, operates the long island power authority's (lipa) transmission and distribution (t&d) system under a contractual agreement; and pseg services corporation (services), which provides us and these operating subsidiaries with certain management, administrative and general services at cost.
our business discussion in part i, item 1. business provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. our risk factor discussion in part i, item 1a. risk factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. the following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2014 and key factors that we expect will drive our future performance. this discussion refers to the consolidated financial statements (statements) and the related notes to consolidated financial statements (notes). this discussion should be read in conjunction with such statements and notes.
2014 overview our business plan seeks to achieve growth while managing risks. we continue our focus on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment. these guiding principles have provided the base from which we have been able to execute our strategic initiatives, including:
•   growing our utility operations through continued investment in t&amp;d infrastructure projects with greater diversity of regulatory oversight, and
•   maintaining a reliable generation fleet with the flexibility to utilize a diverse mix of fuels to allow us to respond to market volatility and capitalize on opportunities as they arise in the locations in which we operate.
our $275 million 2014 over 2013 increase in net income was due primarily to higher transmission revenues at pse&g and mark-to-market gains in 2014 as compared to losses in 2013 and higher volumes of gas sales under the bgss contract and to third party customers at power. in addition, the increase was also due to lower operations and maintenance (o&m) costs at pse&g and power, principally related to a reduction in pension and other postretirement employee benefit (opeb) costs. these factors were partially offset by lower volumes of electricity sold under the bgs contract and higher fuel costs incurred to generate electricity at power. for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, see results of operations.
at pse&g, our regulated utility, we continued to invest capital in t&d infrastructure projects aimed at maintaining the reliability of our service to our customers. pse&g's results for 2014 reflect the favorable impacts from these investments as well as a slowly improving economy. effective january 1, 2014, pse&g's formula rate increased our annual transmission revenues by approximately $171 million. in october 2014, we filed our 2015 formula rate update with the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) for approximately $182 million in increased annual transmission revenues which went into effect on january 1, 2015. each year, transmission revenues are adjusted to reflect items such as updating estimates used in the filing with actual data. the adjustment for 2015 will include the impact of the extension of bonus depreciation, which was enacted after the filing was made, and is estimated to reduce our 2015 revenue increase as filed by approximately $21 million. over the past few years, these types of investments have altered the business mix of our overall results of operations to reflect a higher percentage contribution by pse&g.
power's results benefited from access to natural gas supplies through its existing firm pipeline transportation contracts during the cold weather experienced in the first quarter of 2014. power manages these contracts for the benefit of pse&g's customers through the bgss arrangement. the contracts are sized to ensure delivery of a reliable gas supply to pse&g customers on peak winter days. when pipeline capacity beyond the customers' needs is available, power can use it to make third party sales and supply gas to its generating units in new jersey.
power's 2014 results were unfavorably impacted by an extended refueling outage at salem unit 2. a planned refueling outage began on april 12, 2014 but was extended due to repairs to the reactor coolant pump turning vanes. salem unit 2 returned to service on july 14, 2014.
regulatory, legislative and other developments in our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, we closely monitor significant regulatory and legislative developments. transmission planning rules and wholesale power market design are of particular importance to our results and we continue to advocate for policies and rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets.
transmission planning the ferc's rule under order 1000 altered the right of first refusal (rofr) previously held by incumbent utilities to build all transmission within their respective service territories. our challenge to the rule itself was rejected by the federal court. however, the ferc's action presents opportunities for us to construct transmission outside of our service territory as long as the applicable rules are clear to all participating transmission developers. in april 2013, pjm interconnection, l.l.c. (pjm) initiated a solicitation process pursuant to order 1000 to review technical solutions to improve the operational performance in the artificial island area, consisting of our salem and hope creek nuclear generation facilities. pjm has not yet made a decision in this process. on january 30, 2015, pse&g filed a complaint against pjm at the ferc, arguing that pjm had failed to follow its rules during this process and requesting that the ferc order pjm to do so. if the ferc grants this complaint, the ferc could order pjm to re-start the entire process or make changes to the rules governing future competitive solicitations.
pjm filed with the ferc, and the ferc has recently accepted, a new "multi-driver" category of transmission projects, which projects may include a combination of reliability, economic and public policy elements. changes to the factors used in making determinations in the pjm project planning and cost-allocation processes could have significant implications for the types of projects selected and the utility customers ultimately charged for the costs of such new transmission facilities. see part i, item 1. business-federal regulation-transmission regulation-transmission policy developments.
wholesale power market design capacity market design, including the reliability pricing model (rpm), remains an important focus for us. in may 2014, a federal court issued a rule that vacated a ferc order in which the ferc had determined that demand response (dr) providers should receive full market compensation for power and held that the ferc has no jurisdiction over dr. a subsequent challenge to the participation of dr as a resource in the pjm capacity market is pending at the ferc as is a filing made by pjm at the ferc that would remove dr as a supply resource in upcoming auctions. in addition, pjm has filed at the ferc to reset the demand curve for the rpm, which ferc subsequently accepted. we generally supported pjm's approach in the filing but sought rehearing on certain issues, including the proper level of labor costs required to build new generation in new jersey, which is pending. further, in december 2014, pjm filed at the ferc its proposal for a capacity performance product to include generators, dr and energy efficiency providers who would certify as to availability during emergency conditions, as a supplement to base capacity and with enhanced performance-based incentives and penalties. the implications of these developments could be significant for the capacity market. see part i, item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-capacity market issues-pjm for additional information.
under the pjm capacity auction conducted in may 2014, power cleared 8,693 mw of its generating capacity at an average price of $164.61 mw-day for the 2017-2018 delivery period, a price consistent with what has been realized in the past three auctions. for a more detailed discussion on the rpm capacity auction, refer to part i, item 1. business-federal regulation-capacity market issues-pjm.
in 2014, appeals to challenge the federal court rulings that the new jersey long-term capacity agreement pilot program act to subsidize above-market new generation and a similar action taken by maryland were unconstitutional and null and void were each denied. the appellants subsequently sought review at the u.s. supreme court and the u.s. supreme court has not yet acted. for additional information, refer to part i, item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-capacity market issues-long-term capacity agreement pilot program act.
a critical aspect of our wholesale energy marketing business is the continued retention of market-based rate (mbr) authority from the ferc for our operating subsidiaries that engage in such activities. on october 14, 2014, the ferc issued an order that accepted our triennial market power update, concluding that our submission satisfied its requirements for retention of mbr authority.
environmental regulation we also advocate for the development and implementation of fair and reasonable rules by the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) and state environmental regulators. on may 19, 2014, the epa released the final clean water act section 316(b) rule on cooling water intake that establishes new requirements for the regulation of cooling water intakes at existing power plants and industrial facilities with a design flow of more than two million gallons of water per day. eight of power's generating facilities and three of its jointly-owned generating facilities are subject to the rule. as adopted by the epa, the rule requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts, primarily by reducing the amount of fish and shellfish that are impinged or entrained at a cooling water intake structure. under this standard, power facilities have the flexibility to select one of several options as their method of compliance. however, the epa has structured the rule so that each state will continue to consider renewal permits for existing power facilities on a case by case basis, and will require facilities to conduct a wide range of studies related to impingement mortality and entrainment and submit the results with their permit applications. a federal court challenge to the epa rule is pending. we are unable to predict the outcome that these permitting decisions may take and the effect, if any, that they may have on us although such impacts could be material. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities and part i, item 1. business-environmental matters-water pollution control for additional information.
in june 2014, the epa issued a proposed greenhouse gas emissions regulation for existing power plants. the regulation establishes state-specific emission rate targets based on implementation of the best system of emission reduction. states may choose these or other methodologies to achieve the necessary reductions of carbon dioxide emissions. the epa had requested comment on many aspects of the proposal and therefore, the final rule may look considerably different than the proposal. we continue to work with state and federal regulators, as well as industry partners, to determine the potential impact of the regulation. see part i, item 1. business-environmental matters-climate change for additional information.
in addition, clean air act (caa) regulations governing hazardous air pollutants under the epa's maximum achievable control technology rules are also of significance; however, we believe our generation business remains well-positioned for such air pollution control regulations if and when they are implemented.
other developments in recent years we have been impacted by severe weather conditions, including hurricane irene in 2011 and superstorm sandy in 2012, the latter storm resulting in the highest level of customer outages in our history. for more detailed information, refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities-superstorm sandy. we have begun work in our gas and electric distribution systems to improve resiliency. the new jersey board of public utilities (bpu) approved the settlement of our energy strong proposal in a total amount of $1.22 billion. the settlement provides for cost recovery at a 9.75% rate of return on equity on the first $1.0 billion of the investment, plus associated allowance for funds used during construction, through an accelerated recovery mechanism. we will seek recovery of the remaining $220 million of investment in pse&g's next base rate case, which is to be filed no later than november 1, 2017. we filed our initial energy strong cost recovery petition, seeking bpu approval to recover in base rates an estimated annual revenue increase of $1.1 million effective march 1, 2015. this increase represents capitalized energy strong electric investment costs in service through november 30, 2014. for additional information, refer to part i, item 1. business-regulatory issues-state regulation-energy strong program.
in september 2014, the bpu approved substantially our entire request for a determination that our storm related costs, in the total amount of $366 million, were prudently incurred and recoverable in a future base rate proceeding, subject to offset for the amount of insurance proceeds received. for additional information, refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 5. regulatory assets and liabilities.
on january 1, 2014, we commenced operation of the lipa t&d system under a twelve-year contract with opportunity to extend for an additional eight years. in addition, in january 2015, power assumed responsibility for fuel procurement and power management services to lipa under separate agreements.
in the first and second quarters of 2014, power discovered and further investigated (i) incorrect calculations for certain components of its cost-based bids for its new jersey fossil generating units in the pjm energy market and (ii) differences in the quantity of energy that power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units from the amount for which power was compensated in the capacity market for those units. we informed the ferc, pjm and the pjm independent market monitor of these issues, and have corrected these errors. power has an ongoing process of implementing improved procedures to help mitigate the risk of similar issues occurring in the future. in the third quarter of 2014, the ferc staff initiated a preliminary, non-public staff investigation into the matter. this investigation could result in the ferc seeking disgorgement of any over-collected amounts, civil penalties and non-financial remedies. it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the ultimate impact or predict any resulting penalties, other costs associated with this matter, or the applicability of mitigating factors. for more detailed information regarding this matter, refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities-ferc compliance.
operational excellence we emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses. flexibility in our generating fleet has allowed us to take advantage of market opportunities presented during the year as we remain diligent in managing costs. in 2014, our
•   diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility allowed us to generate approximately 54,000 gwh, while addressing unit outages and balancing fuel availability and price volatility,
•   bergen 1 and 2 and linden 1 units and our combined cycle gas turbine fleet overall achieved record generation,
•   hope creek unit achieved its second best generation ever,
•   construction of transmission and solar projects proceeded on schedule and within budget, and
•   utility ranked highest in electric and gas service business customer satisfaction among large utilities in the eastern united states.
financial strength our financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. our financial position remained strong during 2014 as we:
•   extended the expiration dates of pseg's $500 million and power's $1.6 billion five-year credit facilities from 2017 to 2019, and maintained substantial liquidity,
•   maintained solid investment grade credit ratings, and
we expect to be able to fund our transmission projects required under pjm's reliability program, our energy strong program and other projects with internally generated cash and external debt financing.
disciplined investment we utilize rigorous investment criteria when deploying capital and seek to invest in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. these areas include upgrading our energy infrastructure, responding to trends in environmental protection and providing new energy supplies in domestic markets with growing demand. in 2014 we:
•   placed into service our 230 kv burlington-camden and 230 kv north central reliability transmission projects,
•   made additional investments in transmission infrastructure projects,
•   continued to execute our existing bpu-approved utility programs,
•   completed installation of equipment to increase output and improve efficiency at our linden combined cycle gas generating plant and continue to plan for the installation of such equipment at our bergen 2 and bethlehem energy center (bec) combined cycle gas units,
•   completed the physical upgrades for the extended power uprate at peach bottom unit 2,
•   acquired an equity interest with an expected investment of $100 million-$120 million in the approximately 110 mile penneast pipeline to transport natural gas from eastern pennsylvania to new jersey, and
•   acquired rights to solar energy facilities located near el paso, texas and burlington, vermont, totaling 16.6 mwdc which became operational in late 2014 and a 12.9 mwdc solar energy facility located near waldorf, maryland which we expect to be operational before june 2015.
future outlook our future success will depend on our ability to continue to maintain strong operational and financial performance in a slow-moving economy and a cost-constrained environment, to capitalize on or otherwise address appropriately regulatory and legislative developments that impact our business and to respond to the issues and challenges described below. in order to do this, we must continue to
•   focus on controlling costs while maintaining safety and reliability and complying with applicable standards and requirements,
•   successfully manage our energy obligations and re-contract our open supply positions,
•   execute our capital investment program, including our energy strong program and other investments for growth that yield contemporaneous and reasonable risk-adjusted returns, while enhancing the resiliency of our infrastructure and maintaining the reliability of the service we provide to our customers,
•   advocate for measures to ensure the implementation by pjm and the ferc of market design rules that continue to promote fair and efficient electricity markets,
•   regulatory and political uncertainty, both with regard to future energy policy, design of energy and capacity markets, transmission policy and environmental regulation, as well as with respect to the outcome of any legal, regulatory or other proceeding, settlement, investigation or claim, applicable to us and/or the energy industry,
•   the continuing potential for sustained lower natural gas and electricity prices, both at market hubs and at locations where we operate, and
•   delays and other obstacles that might arise in connection with the construction of our t&amp;d projects, including in connection with permitting and regulatory approvals.
(a)   pse&amp;g's results in 2012 include after-tax expenses of $24 million for o&amp;m costs and power's results in 2014, 2013 and 2012 include after-tax expenses of $17 million, $32 million and $39 million, respectively, for o&amp;m costs net of insurance recoveries in 2013 and 2012, due to severe damage caused by superstorm sandy. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
(b)   other includes after-tax activities at the parent company, pseg li and energy holdings as well as intercompany eliminations.
•   mark-to-market (mtm) gains in 2014 resulting from a decrease in prices on forward positions, as compared to mtm losses in 2013,
•   lower volumes of electricity sold under power's basic generation service (bgs) contracts resulting from serving fewer tranches in 2014, and
•   lower volumes of electricity sold under power's bgs contracts at lower average prices,
•   unfavorable amounts related to the mtm activity, discussed below,
•   higher income tax expense due to the absence of tax benefits related to the settlement of the 1997-2006 irs audits in 2012 (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 19. income taxes).
•   higher capacity revenues in the pjm region resulting from higher average prices as well as higher generation sold primarily in the pjm region,
our results include the realized gains, losses and earnings on power's nuclear decommissioning trust (ndt) fund and other related ndt activity. net realized gains, interest and dividend income and other costs related to the ndt fund are recorded in other income and deductions, and impairments on certain ndt securities are recorded as other-than-temporary impairments.  interest accretion expense on power's nuclear asset retirement obligation (aro) is recorded in operation and maintenance expense and the depreciation related to the aro asset is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense. in 2014 and 2012, we restructured portions of our ndt fund and realized gains of $65 million and $59 million, respectively.
our results also include the after-tax impacts of non-trading mtm activity, which consist of the financial impact from positions with forward delivery dates.
the combined after-tax impact on net income for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 include the changes related to ndt fund and mtm activity shown in the chart below:
millions, after tax ndt fund and related activity          $68           $40               $52
pseg our results of operations are primarily comprised of the results of operations of our principal operating subsidiaries, power and pse&g, excluding charges related to intercompany transactions, which are eliminated in consolidation. for additional information on intercompany transactions, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 23. related-party transactions.
income from equity method investments              13                    11                    12                    2                18                     (1     )          (8     )
the 2014 amounts in the preceding table for operating revenues and o&m costs each include $389 million for servco. these amounts represent the o&m pass-through costs for the long island operations, the full reimbursement of which is reflected in operating revenues. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 3. variable interest entities for further explanation. the following discussions for power and pse&g provide a detailed explanation of their respective variances.
operating revenues increased $111 million due primarily to changes in delivery, clause, commodity and other operating revenues.
•   gas distribution revenues decreased $5 million due primarily to lower weather normalization clause (wnc) revenue of $32 million due to more normal weather compared to the prior year, lower transitional energy facilities assessment (tefa) revenue of $22 million due to elimination of the tefa tax effective january 1, 2014, lower capital infrastructure program (cip) related revenue of $11 million, partially offset by higher sales volumes of $54 million, and higher revenue from solar and energy efficiency recovery charges (formerly rrc and currently green program recovery charges (gprc)) of $6 million.
clause revenues decreased $51 million due primarily to lower societal benefit charges (sbc) of $32 million, lower securitization transition charge (stc) revenues of $18 million, and lower margin adjustment clause (mac) of $7 million, partially offset by higher solar pilot recovery charge (sprc) of $6 million. the changes in sbc, stc, mac and sprc amounts were entirely offset by the amortization of related costs (regulatory assets) in o&m, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. pse&g does not earn margin on sbc, stc, mac or sprc collections.
commodity revenue increased $68 million due to higher electric and gas revenues. this is entirely offset with increased energy costs. pse&g earns no margin on the provision of bgs and bgss to retail customers.
•   electric revenues increased $22 million due primarily to $64 million in higher bgs revenues, partially offset by $42 million in lower revenues from the sale of non-utility generation (nug) energy and collections of non-utility generation charges (ngc) due primarily to lower prices. bgs sales increased 2% due primarily to weather.
operating expenses energy costs increased $68 million. this is entirely offset by commodity revenue.
•   $73 million in pension and other postretirement benefits (opeb) expenses, and
•   $47 million in additional plant in service, and
•   $16 million due to partial redemption of securitization debt in 2014,
•   $25 million due to maturities of $725 million in 2013, and
•   $5 million due to maturities of $500 million in 2014,
operating revenues increased $29 million due primarily to changes in delivery, clause, commodity and other operating revenues.
commodity revenue decreased $318 million due to lower electric and gas revenues. this is entirely offset as savings in energy costs. pse&g earns no margin on the provision of bgs and bgss to retail customers.
operating expenses energy costs decreased $318 million. this is entirely offset by commodity revenue.
•   $33 million in additional plant in service.
income tax expense increased $74 million due primarily to higher pre-tax income and the absence of tax benefits related to the settlement of the 1997-2006 irs audits in 2012.
income from equity method investments              14                    16                    15                   (2     )         (13     )                1                 7
•   higher revenues of $366 million due primarily to mtm gains in 2014 resulting from a decrease in prices on forward positions and higher energy volumes sold in the new york and new england (ne) regions, and
•   partially offset by a decrease of $89 million due to lower volumes of electricity sold as a result of serving fewer tranches in 2014 under our bgs contracts and lower average pricing, and
other operating revenues increased $15 million due to transition fees related to fuel management and power supply management contracts with lipa.
operating expenses energy costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel costs for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet power's obligation under its bgss contract with pse&g. energy costs increased $251 million due to
•   generation costs increased $252 million due primarily to higher fuel costs, reflecting higher average realized natural gas prices, the unfavorable mtm impact from lower average natural gas prices on forward positions and the utilization of higher volumes of gas and oil. these increased costs were partially offset by lower congestion costs in the pjm region.
•   a decrease of $15 million due primarily to the outage of our 100%-owned hope creek nuclear facility in the fall of 2013, which was partially offset by the extension of our 57%-owned nuclear salem unit 2 refueling outage in 2014, and
•   partially offset by an increase of $40 million related primarily to higher planned outage and maintenance costs at our fossil plants, including maintenance and installation of upgraded technology at our linden combined cycle gas generating plant and outages at our keystone and hudson facilities.
income from equity method investments experienced no material change.
interest expense increased $6 million due primarily to the issuance of a $250 million 2.45% senior note and a $250 million 4.30% senior note in november 2013, partially offset by the maturity of $300 million of 2.50% senior notes in april 2013.
•   an increase of $341 million due to higher capacity revenues resulting from higher average auction prices and an increase in operating reserve revenues in pjm, and
•   higher net revenues of $36 million due primarily to higher generation sold in the pjm and ne regions partly offset by higher mtm losses in 2013 resulting from an increase in prices on forward positions in the pjm and ne regions,
•   partially offset by a decrease of $155 million due primarily to lower volumes of electricity sold under our bgs contracts and lower average pricing, and
operating expenses energy costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel costs for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet power's obligation under its bgss contract with pse&g. energy costs increased $115 million due to
•   generation costs increased $75 million due primarily to $84 million of higher fuel costs, reflecting higher average realized natural gas prices, higher nuclear fuel costs and the utilization of higher volumes of coal and oil, partially offset by lower average coal prices and lower average unrealized natural gas prices on forward positions.
•   higher outage costs at our nuclear generating facilities, primarily at our 100%-owned hope creek station.
depreciation and amortization increased $31 million due primarily to a higher depreciable asset base at fossil and nuclear, including placing into service the new gas-fired peaking units at kearny, new jersey and new haven, connecticut in june 2012, completion of the steam path retrofit upgrade at our co-owned peach bottom unit 2 in october 2012, and placing two solar facilities into service in the fourth quarter of 2012. in addition, an update to the nuclear asset retirement obligation became effective in november 2012, causing higher depreciation in 2013.
income from equity method investments experienced no material change.
other income (deductions) decreased $6 million due primarily to lower ndt fund realized gains in 2013, partially offset by lower ndt fund realized losses in 2013. in addition, we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt in 2012.
interest expense decreased $16 million due primarily to a decrease of $23 million resulting from the maturity of $300 million of 2.50% of senior notes in april 2013, and the early redemptions of $250 million of 5.00% medium term notes and various tax-exempt bonds in december 2012, partially offset by higher interest costs of $6 million in 2013 since interest capitalization ceased for our kearny and new haven gas-fired peaking projects on their june 2012 in-service date.
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of our two direct major operating subsidiaries.
financing methodology we expect our capital requirements to be met through internally generated cash flows and external financings, consisting of short-term debt for working capital needs and long-term debt for capital investments.
pse&g's sources of external liquidity include a $600 million multi-year syndicated credit facility. pse&g's commercial paper program is the primary vehicle for meeting seasonal, intra-month and temporary working capital needs. pse&g does not engage in any intercompany borrowing or lending. pse&g maintains back-up facilities in an amount sufficient to cover the commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding. pse&g's dividend payments to pseg are consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings. pse&g's long-term financing plan is designed to replace maturities, fund a portion of its capital program and manage short-term debt balances. generally, pse&g uses either secured medium-term notes or first mortgage bonds to raise long-term capital.
pseg, power, energy holdings, pseg li and services participate in a corporate money pool, an aggregation of daily cash balances designed to efficiently manage their respective short-term liquidity needs. servco does not participate in the corporate money pool. servco's short-term liquidity needs are met through an account funded and owned by lipa.
pseg's sources of external liquidity include multi-year syndicated credit facilities totaling $1 billion. these facilities are available to back-stop pseg's commercial paper program, issue letters of credit and for general corporate purposes. these facilities may also be used to provide support to pseg's subsidiaries. pseg's credit facilities and the commercial paper program are available to support pseg working capital needs or to temporarily fund growth opportunities in advance of obtaining permanent financing. from time to time, pseg may make equity contributions or provide credit support to its subsidiaries.
power's sources of external liquidity include $2.6 billion of syndicated multi-year credit facilities. additionally, from time to time, power maintains bilateral credit agreements designed to enhance its liquidity position. power has $100 million of bilateral credit agreements that are scheduled to expire in september 2015. credit capacity is primarily used to provide collateral in support of power's forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts as the market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, and to meet potential collateral postings in the event of a credit rating downgrade below investment grade. power's dividend payments to pseg are also designed to be consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings and provide sufficient financial flexibility. generally, power issues senior unsecured debt to raise long-term capital.
operating cash flows we expect our operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments.
•   an increase of $83 million due to decrease in employee benefit plan funding,
•   a decrease of $47 million in benefit plan funding,
•   partially offset by a decrease of $73 million related to margin deposits, and
•   a decrease of $26 million in employee benefit plan funding.
short-term liquidity we continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements. each of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the pseg facilities can also be used to support our subsidiaries' liquidity needs. our total credit facilities and available liquidity as of december 31, 2014 were as follows:
company/facility                                                       as of december 31, 2014
totalfacility                                 usage              availableliquidity millions pseg                          $1,000                  $8                             $992
as of december 31, 2014, our credit facility capacity was in excess of our projected maximum liquidity requirements over our 12 month planning horizon. our maximum liquidity requirements are based on stress scenarios that incorporate changes in commodity prices and the potential impact of power losing its investment grade credit rating. pse&g's credit facility primary use is to support its commercial paper program under which as of december 31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding. most of our credit facilities expire in 2018 and 2019. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities and note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
for a discussion of our long-term debt transactions during 2014 and into 2015, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
debt covenants our credit agreements contain maximum debt to equity ratios and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. we are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. continued compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon our future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.
in addition, under its first and refunding mortgage (mortgage), pse&g may issue new first and refunding mortgage bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and/or against retired mortgage bonds. as of december 31, 2014, pse&g's mortgage coverage ratio was 5.6 to 1 and the mortgage would permit up to approximately $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of new mortgage bonds to be issued against additions and improvements to its property.
default provisions our bank credit agreements and indentures contain various default provisions that could result in the potential acceleration of payment under the defaulting company's agreement. we have not defaulted under these agreements.
pseg's bank credit agreements contain cross default provisions under which events at power or pse&g, including payment defaults, bankruptcy events, the failure to satisfy certain final judgments or other events of default under their financing agreements, would each constitute an event of default. under the bank credit agreements, it would be an event of default if both pse&g and power cease to be wholly owned by pseg.
there are no cross default provisions to affiliates in pse&g's or power's credit agreements or indentures.
ratings triggers our debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any material 'ratings triggers' that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. however, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. in the event that we are not able to affirm representations and warranties on credit agreements, lenders would not be required to make loans.
in accordance with bpu requirements under the bgs contracts, pse&g is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. if pse&g were to lose its investment grade rating, it would be required to file a plan to assure continued payment for the bgs requirements of its customers.
pse&g is the servicer for the bonds issued by pse&g transition funding llc and pse&g transition funding ii llc. cash collected by pse&g to service these bonds is commingled with pse&g's other cash until it is remitted to the bond trustee each month. if pse&g were to lose its investment grade rating, pse&g would be required to remit collected cash daily to the bond trustee. pse&g is prohibited from advancing its own funds to make payments related to such bonds.
fluctuations in commodity prices or a deterioration of power's credit rating to below investment grade could increase power's required margin postings under various agreements entered into in the normal course of business. power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet the required posting of collateral which would likely result from a credit rating downgrade at today's market prices.
on february 17, 2015, our board of directors approved a $0.39 per share common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2015. this reflects an indicated annual dividend rate of $1.56 per share. we expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
credit ratings if the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital. credit ratings shown are for securities that we typically issue. outlooks are shown for corporate credit ratings (s&p) and issuer credit ratings (moody's and fitch) and can be stable, negative, or positive. there is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances warrant. each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies' ratings. the ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.
in may 2014, moody's published updated research reports on pseg, pse&g and power and the existing ratings and outlooks were unchanged. in may 2014, s&p published updated research reports and revised the outlook to positive from stable for pseg's corporate credit rating. s&p also affirmed the senior unsecured rating of bbb+ at power and mortgage bond rating of a at pse&g. in october 2014, fitch affirmed the ratings and outlooks for pseg, pse&g and power.

other comprehensive income for the year ended december 31, 2014, we had other comprehensive loss of $188 million on a consolidated basis. other comprehensive loss was due primarily to a $173 million increase in our consolidated liability for pension and postretirement benefits and a $27 million decrease in net unrealized gains related to available-for-sale securities, and was partially offset by $12 million of unrealized gains on derivative contracts accounted for as hedges. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 20. accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax for additional information.
capital requirements it is expected that all of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from a combination of internally generated funds and external debt financing. projected capital construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for the next three years are presented in the table below. these amounts are subject to change, based on various factors. we will continue to approach non-regulated solar and other renewables investments opportunistically, seeking projects that will provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.

pse&g pse&g's projections for future capital expenditures include material additions and replacements to its transmission and distribution systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability. as project scope and cost estimates develop, pse&g will modify its current projections to include these required investments. pse&g's projected expenditures for the various items reported above are primarily comprised of the following:
•   reliability enhancements-investments made to maintain the reliability and efficiency of the system or function.
•   facility replacement-investments made to replace systems or equipment in kind.
•   support facilities-ancillary equipment needed to support the business lines, such as computers, office furniture and buildings and structures housing support personnel or equipment/inventory.
in 2014, pse&g made $2,170 million of capital expenditures, including $2,164 million of investment in plant, primarily for transmission and distribution system reliability and $6 million in solar loan investments. this does not include expenditures for cost of removal, net of salvage, of $98 million, which are included in operating cash flows.
power power's projected expenditures for the various items listed above are primarily comprised of the following:
•   fossil growth opportunities-investments associated with upgrades to increase efficiency and output at combined cycle plants.
•   nuclear expansion-investments associated with certain nuclear capital projects, primarily at existing facilities designed to increase operating output.
•   solar expansion-investments associated with the construction of utility-scale photovoltaic facilities.
in 2014, power made $460 million of capital expenditures, excluding $166 million for nuclear fuel, primarily related to various projects at fossil and nuclear.

other through energy holdings, we have investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with gaap accounting for leases. leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. in a typical leveraged lease arrangement, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. the purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. the creditor provides long-term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. such long-term financing is non-recourse to the lessor and is not presented on our consolidated balance sheets. in the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secures the loan. as a lessor, energy holdings has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operations. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 6. long-term investments.
in the event that collection of the minimum lease payments to be received by energy holdings is no longer reasonably assured, the accounting treatment for some of the leases may change. in such cases, energy holdings may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation, and would reclassify the lease from a leveraged lease to an operating lease and would consider the need to record an impairment of its investment. should this event occur, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease.
critical accounting estimates under gaap, many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. we have determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to the respective businesses.
accounting for pensions pseg sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering pseg's and its participating affiliates' current and former employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. the market-related value of plan assets held for the qualified pension plan is equal to the fair value of these assets as of year-end. the plan assets are comprised of investments in both debt and equity securities which are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. we calculate pension costs using various economic and demographic assumptions.
assumptions and approach used: economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on trust assets. demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns.
in selecting the annual discount rate to calculate benefit obligations, we utilize a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds with cash flows that match the benefit plan liability. the composite yield on the hypothetical bond portfolio reflects the rate at which the obligations could effectively be settled.
based on the above assumptions, we have estimated net periodic pension expense of approximately $55 million, net of amounts capitalized.
we utilize a corridor approach that reduces the volatility of reported pension expense /income. the corridor requires differences between actuarial assumptions and plan results be deferred and amortized as part of expense/income. this occurs only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of each year-end. the excess would be amortized over the average remaining service period of the active employees, which is approximately eight years.
effect if different assumptions used: as part of the business planning process, we have modeled future costs assuming an 8.00% rate of return and a 4.20% discount rate for 2015. actual future pension expense/income and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans.
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions. the effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption.

see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information.
we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage risk from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. in accordance with our hedging strategy, derivatives that are hedging these risks and qualify are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. for derivatives designated as hedges, the change in the value of a derivative instrument is measured against the offsetting change in the value of the underlying contract, anticipated transaction or other business condition that the derivative instrument is intended to hedge. this is known as the measure of hedge effectiveness. changes in the fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings. changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. any hedge ineffectiveness is included in current period earnings. during periods of extreme price volatility, there will be significant changes in the value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
for our wholesale energy business, many of the forward sale, forward purchase, option and other contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but do not meet the requirements for either cash flow or fair value hedge accounting. the changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as the related commodity prices fluctuate. as a result, our earnings may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices.
effect if different assumptions used: any significant changes to the fair market values of our derivatives instruments could result in a material change in the value of the assets or liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and could result in a material change to the unrealized gains or losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.
for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 15. financial risk management activities.
lease investments our investments in leases, included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets, are comprised of lease receivables (net of non-recourse debt), the estimated residual value of leased assets, and unearned and deferred income. a significant portion of the estimated residual value of leased assets is related to merchant power plants leased to other energy companies. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6. long-term investments and note 7. financing receivables.
•   estimated forward power and capacity prices in the years after the lease,
•   future capital expenditures required to maintain the plants,
effect if different assumptions used: a significant change to the assumptions, such as a large decrease in near-term power prices that affects the market's view of long-term power prices, or a change in the credit rating or bankruptcy of a counterparty, could result in an impairment of one or more of the residual values, but not necessarily to all of the residual values. however, if, because of changes in assumptions, all the residual values related to the merchant energy plants were deemed to be zero, we would recognize an after-tax charge to income of approximately $177 million.
ndt fund our ndt fund comprises both debt and equity securities. the assets in the ndt fund are classified as available-for-sale securities and are marked to market with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) unless securities with such unrealized losses are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. unrealized losses that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired are charged against earnings rather than accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reflected as a separate line in the consolidated statement of operations. realized gains, losses and dividend and interest income are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as other income and other deductions.
assumptions and approach used: the ndt fund investments are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 16. fair value measurements for additional information.
effect if different assumptions used: any significant changes to the fair market values of the fund securities could result in a material change in the value of our ndt fund with a corresponding impact to earnings, which could potentially result in additional funding requirements to satisfy our decommissioning obligations. see item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information.
pse&g, power and services recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. these aros are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred and are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets. pse&g, as a rate-regulated entity, recognizes regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recording of costs and costs recovered through the rate-making process. we accrete the aro liability to reflect the passage of time.
assumptions and approach used: because quoted market prices are not available for aros, we estimate the initial fair value of an aro by calculating discounted cash flows that are dependent upon various assumptions, including:
•   amounts and timing of future cash expenditures associated with retirement, settlement or remediation activities,
•   if applicable, past experience with government regulators regarding similar obligations.
we obtain updated cost studies triennially unless new information necessitates more frequent updates. the most recent cost study was done in 2012. when we revise any assumptions used to calculate fair values of existing aros, we adjust the aro balance and corresponding long-lived asset which impacts the amount of accretion and depreciation expense recognized in future periods.
nuclear decommissioning aros aros related to the future decommissioning of power's nuclear facilities comprised 93% of power's total aros as of december 31, 2014. power determines its aros for its nuclear units by assigning probability weighting to various discounted cash flow outcomes for each of its nuclear units that incorporate the assumptions above as well as:
effect if different assumptions used: changes in the assumptions could result in a material change in the aro balance sheet obligation and the period over which we accrete to the ultimate liability. for example, a decrease of 1% in the discount rate would result in a $141 million increase in the nuclear aro as of december 31, 2014. an increase of 1% in the inflation rate would result in a $372 million increase in the nuclear aro as of december 31, 2014. also, if we did not assume that we would recover from the federal government the costs incurred for spent nuclear fuel, the nuclear aro would increase by $302 million at december 31, 2014.
accounting for regulated businesses pse&g prepares its financial statements to comply with gaap for rate-regulated enterprises, which differs in some respects from accounting for non-regulated businesses. in general, accounting for rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. as a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (regulatory asset) or recognize obligations (regulatory liability) if the rates established are designed to recover the costs and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged or collected. this accounting results in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than that of enterprises that are not regulated.
assumptions and approach used: pse&g recognizes regulatory assets where it is probable that such costs will be recoverable in future rates from customers and regulatory liabilities where it is probable that refunds will be made to customers in future billings. the highest degree of probability is an order from the bpu either approving recovery of the deferred costs over a future period or requiring the refund of a liability over a future period.
virtually all of pse&g's regulatory assets and liabilities are supported by bpu orders. in the absence of an order, pse&g will consider the following when determining whether to record a regulatory asset or liability:
•   past experience regarding similar items with the bpu,
•   treatment of a similar item in an order by the bpu for another utility,
•   recent discussions with the bpu.
all deferred costs are subject to prudence reviews by the bpu. when the recovery of a regulatory asset or payment of a regulatory liability is no longer probable, pse&g charges or credits earnings, as appropriate.
effect if different assumptions used: a change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on our results of operations or our cash flows. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 5. regulatory assets and liabilities for a description of the amounts and nature of regulatory balance sheet amounts.

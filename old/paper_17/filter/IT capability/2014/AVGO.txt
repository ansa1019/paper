item 1a.   risk factors our business, operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our ordinary shares. the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the sec, press releases, communications with investors and oral statements.
risks related to our business the acquisition of lsi and the integration of its business, operations and employees with our own involves risks and the failure to integrate successfully in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results.
our acquisition of lsi on may 6, 2014 is our largest acquisition to date, by a significant margin. any failure to successfully integrate the business, operations and employees of lsi, or to otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, could harm our results of operations. our ability to realize these benefits will depend on the timely integration and consolidation of organizations, operations, facilities, procedures, policies and technologies, and the harmonization of differences in the business cultures between the two companies and their personnel. integration of the lsi business will be complex and time-consuming, will involve additional expense and could disrupt our business and divert management's attention from ongoing business concerns. the challenges involved in integrating lsi include:
•   preserving customer, supplier and other important relationships of both lsi and avago;
•   integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
•   combining and integrating information technology, or it, systems;
•   integrating employees and related hr systems and benefits, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees; and
•   managing the effects of the disposition of lsi's flash and axxia businesses and the transition of their personnel.
as a result of the acquisition of lsi, we are implementing certain cost reduction activities, including the elimination of a substantial number of positions from our combined workforce across all business and functional areas on a global basis, over approximately the next 9-12 months. during this time we will be dependent on the services of a number of employees who are transitioning out of our workforce. we may be unable to successfully manage these employees in the performance of their transition activities.
the benefits we expect to realize from the acquisition of lsi are, necessarily, based on projections and assumptions about the combined businesses of avago and lsi and assume, among other things, the successful integration of lsi into our business and operations. these projections and assumptions may be inaccurate and we may not successfully integrate lsi and our operations in a timely manner, or at all. we may also be exposed to unexpected contingencies or liabilities of lsi. if we do not realize the anticipated benefits of this transaction, our growth strategy and future profitability could be affected. in addition, the acquisition significantly increased the amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could adversely affect our future results of operations.
the majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and the demands or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business.
we are dependent on a reasonably small number of direct customers, oems, or their contract manufacturers, and distributors for a majority of our business, revenue and results of operations, particularly in our wireless and enterprise storage target markets. during fiscal year 2014, direct sales to foxconn accounted for 20% of our net revenue and our top 10 customers, which included three distributors, collectively accounted for 57% of our net revenue. during fiscal year 2013, direct sales to foxconn accounted for 18% of our net revenue and our top 10 customers, which included three distributors, collectively accounted for 64% of our net revenue. however, we also believe our aggregate sales to apple, inc., when our direct sales to it are combined with sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for fiscal year 2014. we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods.
this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced by our significant customers. in addition, our top customers' purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. we expect this trend to continue, which may adversely affect our gross margins on certain products. although we believe that our relationships with our major customers are good, we generally do not have long-term contracts with any of them, which is typical of our industry. our customers often provide us with medium- to long-term product roadmaps and related indications of their product needs and purchases on a periodic basis, but they generally purchase our products on a weekly or daily basis, often pursuant to purchase orders, and the relationship, as well as particular orders, can be terminated at any time without significant penalty. to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers, we start manufacturing our products in advance of receiving purchase orders, based on our customers' forecasts. these forecasts are not binding purchase commitments and, as a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated
sales. since actual demand for our products may not match these forecasts, we may be subject to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs, product obsolescence and increased operating costs. in addition, the loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our major direct or end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.
adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the semiconductor industry generally, as well as in our target markets, which adversely affected our business and results of operations. in recent periods, market and business conditions in general have been adversely affected by investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook, including concerns about economic recovery in the united states, the level of growth in china and conflict in eastern europe and the middle east. macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses. sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions may cause our customers and consumers to reduce or delay spending (leading to reduced demand for our products), could lead to the insolvency of key suppliers (resulting in product delays) and customers, and could intensify pricing pressures. any or all of these factors could negatively affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles (for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which they are used) and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. from time to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general, and in our business in particular. periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, under-utilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. to the extent we cannot offset recessionary periods or periods of reduced growth that may occur in the industry, or in our target markets in particular, through increased market share or otherwise, our business could be adversely affected, net revenues may decline and financial condition and results of operations may suffer. in addition, in any future economic downturn we may be unable to reduce our costs quickly enough to maintain our operating profitability.
we are dependent on a small number of markets, including the mobile handset market, which is volatile and is characterized by short product life cycles, fluctuations in demand, seasonality and increasingly high customer concentration, the hard disk drive market, the data center market and enterprise networking market, and dynamics in these industries could negatively impact our business or results of operations.
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from sales of products for use in mobile handsets, particularly our fbar filter products, the market for which is growing and becoming increasingly competitive. during fiscal year 2014, revenue from our wireless communications target market accounted for 40% of our net revenue. the mobile handset market is characterized by intense competition among an increasingly concentrated group of oems, rapidly evolving technology, including the shift to lte and lte-advanced standards, and changing consumer preferences. these factors result in the frequent introduction of new products, aggressive price competition, short product life cycles, and continually evolving mobile handset specifications. if we, our customers or mobile handset oems are unable to manage product transitions, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected. our success in this market is dependent on the continued competitiveness of our fbar filter products, and on the broad commercial acceptance of the mobile handsets into which our products are incorporated, as well as increasing the amount of our products in successive generations of those handsets. if the mobile handsets into which our products are designed do not achieve significant customer acceptance, our revenue will be adversely affected. similarly, even though we may achieve design wins for a particular handset, we may not be designed into the next generation of a particular handset or new model of handset, which could result in a sharp decrease in our revenues. in the mobile handset market, demand has historically been stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. however, the timing of new handset launches, which also drive demand, is often unpredictable. if mobile handset oems inaccurately forecast consumer demand, this may lead to significant changes in orders to their component suppliers. we have experienced both sharp increases and decreases in orders within the same quarter, often with limited advance notice, and we expect them to occur in the future. in addition, although the worldwide wireless handset market is large, growth trends and other variables are often uncertain and difficult to predict. since the wireless handset market is a consumer-driven market, changes in the economy that affect consumer demand can also adversely affect our business and operating results.
in addition, as a result of our acquisition of lsi, we also derive a substantial portion of our revenues from products used in hard disk drives. the hard disk drive industry has experienced consolidation over the last few years, resulting in fewer design opportunities and hard disk drive programs, and a corresponding increase in the significance of winning or losing any one design or program. additionally, we believe that end users may be purchasing tablet computers, which use flash memory rather than hard disk drives to store data, as a substitute for purchasing a notebook computer containing a hard disk drive. we do not currently provide controllers for flash memory used in tablet computers and further increases in sales of tablet computers could adversely affect our hard disk drive revenues. our acquisition of lsi has also resulted in us deriving a larger portion of our revenue from asics that we design and manufacture, particularly those for datacenter and enterprise networking products, both of which are manufactured by an increasingly concentrated group of large oems.
we may pursue acquisitions, dispositions, investments and joint ventures, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
we may make acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies, augment our market coverage, or enhance our technological capabilities, such as our recent acquisitions of lsi and plx. we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals. we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment, alliance, or joint venture opportunities, that we will be able to consummate any such transactions, or that such transactions will be successful. in addition, our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any acquisition that we make may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such acquisition. from time to time, we may also divest portions of our business that are no longer strategically important or exit minority investments, such as our dispositions of the flash and axxia businesses, which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations for the period in which such events occur. these transactions or any other acquisitions or dispositions involve risks and uncertainties. for example, the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business. in addition, any such integration may require that we incur significant restructuring charges, including as a result of streamlining, or divesting non-core portions of, acquired businesses. to integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. the difficulties of these integrations may be further complicated by such factors as the size of the business or entity acquired, geographic distances, lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business, delays and challenges associated with integrating the business with our existing businesses, diversion of management's attention from daily operations of the business, potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired or combined business, performance problems with the acquired business' technology, difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business, insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition, and our potential inability to achieve the growth prospects and synergies expected from any such acquisition. even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business.
any acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities and ongoing lawsuits, acquire goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges, incur amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, increase our expenses and working capital requirements, and subject us to litigation, which would reduce our return on invested capital. in addition, if the businesses or product lines that we acquire have a different pricing or cost structure than we do, such acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability and reduce our overall margin. failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make or to improve margins of the acquired businesses and products could materially harm our business, operating results and margins. any dispositions we may make may also result in ongoing obligations to us following any such divestiture, for example as a result of any transition services or indemnities we agree to provide to the purchaser in any such transaction, which may result in additional expenses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing, which, in the case of debt financing, would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and, in the case of equity or equity-linked financing, would be dilutive to our existing shareholders. we also incurred a significant amount of debt in connection with our acquisition of lsi, which is secured by the substantial majority of our assets. any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms. as a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all. these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. these fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. these factors include, among others:
•   the timing of launches by our customers of new products, such as cell phones, in which our products are included and changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers;
•   the timing of receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers;
•   fluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers;
•   customer concentration and the gain or loss of significant customers;
•   the timing of acquisitions of, or making and exiting investments in, other entities, businesses or technologies;
•   market acceptance of our products and our customers' products;
•   changes in our product mix or customer mix and their effect on our gross margin;
•   our ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis;
•   the timing and extent of our non-product revenue, such as product development revenues and royalty and other payments from ip, sales and licensing arrangements;
•   our ability to successfully and timely integrate, and realize the benefits of, our acquisitions of lsi and plx and any other significant acquisitions we may make;
•   new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;
•   timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures, and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies;
•   seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets;
•   utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities;
•   fluctuations in manufacturing yields;
•   availability and cost of raw materials from our suppliers;
•   ip disputes and associated litigation expenses;
•   loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers;
•   the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products; and
•   changes in our tax incentive arrangements or structure, which may adversely affect our net tax expense in any quarter in which such an event occurs.
the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. in addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales, research and development and internal manufacturing overhead costs. any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. as a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance. if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares may occur.
winning business is subject to lengthy, competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant expense. even if we begin a product design, a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans, which could cause us to generate no revenues from a product and adversely affect our results of operations.
our business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as "design wins," to develop semiconductors for use in our customers' products. these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. we may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring
significant design and development expenditures. these risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles. for example, cell-phone manufacturers regularly introduce new or upgraded handsets, often every nine to 15 months and sometimes more frequently, and will bid out the components for each new model, and often every upgrade of a particular model. similarly, many of our data storage products also have limited lives before they are replaced by products using newer technology. failure to obtain a particular design win sometimes prevents us from offering successive generations of a product. this can result in lost revenues and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes.
winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. we may experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required, or may not realize as much revenue as we had anticipated. in addition, a delay or cancellation of a customer's plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we may have incurred significant expense in the design process and generated little or no revenue. customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or may fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products, cause us to hold excess inventory and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins occurring at or around the same time, may strain our resources and those of our contract manufacturers. in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional, unanticipated costs and expenses, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
finally, some customers will not purchase any products from us, other than limited numbers of evaluation units, until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing line for the products. the qualification process can take significant time and resources and we may not always be able to satisfy the qualification requirements of these customers. delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of non-qualified products or forgo future orders and result in a significant loss of revenue.
competition in our industry could prevent us from growing our revenue and from raising prices to offset increases in costs.
the global semiconductor market is highly competitive. we compete in different target markets to various degrees on the basis of, among other things, quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering expertise, responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery timing and reliability, and customer sales and technical support. current and prospective customers for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors. some of our competitors are well established, have a more extensive product portfolio, have substantially greater market share and manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. in addition, many of our competitors have longer independent operating histories, greater presence in key markets, more comprehensive patent protection and greater name recognition. we compete with integrated device manufacturers, or idms, and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large, integrated oems. our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings. in addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. because our products are often building block semiconductors providing functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex ics, we also face competition from manufacturers of ics, as well as customers that develop their own ic products.
our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. the actions of our competitors, particularly in the area of pricing, can have a substantial adverse impact on our revenues. during past industry downturns, competition in our end markets intensified as semiconductor manufacturers reduced prices to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels. in industry downturns, manufacturers in financial difficulties or in bankruptcy may implement pricing structures designed to ensure short-term market share and near-term survival, rather than securing long-term viability.
our end markets may not perform as expected and our business and operating results could be harmed in such event.
visibility into our end markets is limited, and industry and target market growth rates may not be as forecasted. any decline in our customers' markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products. in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify and, if we were unable to respond quickly, could significantly reduce our gross margins and reduce our revenue. if target market growth rates are not as expected, particularly in areas such as lte handsets, data centers and storage, to the extent that we incur expenditures on process and product development that do not align with projected market requirements, this could also have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
dependence on contract manufacturing and third-party manufacturers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.
we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes third-party foundry and module assembly and test capabilities. as a result, we are highly reliant on third-party foundry wafer fabrication capacity, including single-sourcing for many components or products. most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular foundry, either our own or with a particular contract manufacturer. for example, tsmc supplies a substantial amount of the wafers we use in our products. we also use third-party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations, including ase korea inc. and inari technology sdn bhd.
the ability and willingness of our contract manufacturers and foundries to perform is largely outside of our control. if one or more of our contract manufacturers or third-party component providers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and to timely deliver products to our customers, and our reputation could suffer. component suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or may discontinue parts due to capacity constraints, changes to manufacturing processes or other factors. we also depend on selected foundries to timely develop new, advanced manufacturing processes and we may be unable to deliver products to our customers if these new processes are not timely developed or we do not have sufficient access to them. for example, we have design wins based on manufacturing processes that are currently under development. if these processes are not developed on schedule, we may lose revenue opportunities and damage our relationships with our customers. further, because of the limited competition among large foundries, it is possible that our foundry partners for products requiring these technologies will price their services at levels that have an adverse impact on our gross margins or make it unprofitable for us to offer these products. this limited competition among foundries may also make it more difficult for us to use a second foundry for a product when we believe that doing so would be advantageous.
some components or parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. if one of our suppliers, particularly a single-source supplier, ceases to, or is unable to, manufacture such a component, or changes its manufacturing process, or if supply is otherwise constrained, we may need to source alternative parts, which may be difficult, expensive and take an extended period of time. we may also be forced to make a significant "lifetime" purchase of the affected component or part, in order to enable us to meet our customer demand, or to re-engineer a product. significant lifetime purchases of such discontinued components could significantly increase our inventory and other expenses, such as insurance costs, and expose us to additional risks, such as the loss of, or damage to, products which may not subsequently be available to us from an alternative source. such supply issues may also cause us to fail to timely meet customer demand. this could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers, and our net revenue could decline. in such events, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
we review our supply chain on an ongoing basis and may seek to qualify second source manufacturers and suppliers for some components and products. only a limited number of foundries provide manufacturing services using the advanced technologies that we require, and we may be unable to secure a second source or replacement foundry for some of our more advanced products. qualifying such second sources, when available, may be a lengthy and potentially costly process and they may not produce as cost-effectively as our other suppliers, which would reduce our margins.
to the extent we rely on third-party manufacturing relationships, we face the following risks:
•   inability of our manufacturers to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products, manufacturers' unwillingness or inability to devote adequate capacity to produce our products, and unanticipated discontinuation of, or changes to, their relevant manufacturing processes;
•   inaccuracies in the forecasts of our product needs from our manufacturers;
•   product and manufacturing costs that are higher than anticipated;
•   reduced control over product reliability, quality, manufacturing yields and delivery schedules;
•   difficulties in obtaining insurance to fully cover all business interruption risk in respect of our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers;
•   more complicated supply chains; and
•   time, expense and uncertainty in identifying and qualifying additional or replacement manufacturers.
much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries, and as a result may additionally be subject to geopolitical uncertainty. see "our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations."
we generally do not have any long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers or materials suppliers and may not be able to obtain the products or raw materials required for our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we purchase a significant portion of our semiconductor materials and finished goods from a few suppliers and contract manufacturers, some of which are single source suppliers. for fiscal year 2014, we purchased 53% of the materials for our manufacturing processes from six suppliers. for fiscal year 2013, we purchased 55% of the materials for our manufacturing processes from six suppliers. substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis, and we do not generally have long-term contracts with our contract manufacturers or suppliers. our manufacturing processes rely on many materials, including silicon and gaas and inp wafers, copper lead frames, precious metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. from time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to commodity price increases, capacity constraints or other factors, which may lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. in the event that we cannot timely obtain sufficient quantities of components or raw materials at reasonable prices, the quality of the material deteriorates or we are not able to pass on higher materials or energy costs to our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
a prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities or other significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
although we operate using a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on the manufacturing facilities we own, in particular our gaas fabs in fort collins, colorado and singapore, our inp fab in breinigsville, pennsylvania and our inp back-end assembly facility in matamoros, mexico. we use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative materials and processes, to protect our ip, to develop the technology for manufacturing and to ensure supply of certain components. many of our facilities, and those of our contract manufacturers and other suppliers, are located in the pacific rim region, which has above average seismic activity and severe weather activity. in addition, our research and development personnel are concentrated in a few locations, primarily china, india, malaysia, singapore, south korea, fort collins, colorado, san jose, california, and breinigsville and allentown, pennsylvania, with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas.
a prolonged disruption at one or more of our production or research facilities for any reason, especially our fort collins, singapore, breinigsville and matamoros facilities, or those of our contract manufacturers or other suppliers, due to natural- or man-made disaster or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of acute illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. any such event would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and could materially and adversely affect our business. such events could also result in significant expenses to repair or replace our affected facilities, and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market.
we are also in the process of relocating our u.s. corporate headquarters to the former lsi campus in san jose, ca, which could require us to incur significant expenses and may cause disruptions to our operations.
we are making substantial capital investments in our fort collins, colorado manufacturing facility and we may not realize the benefit we anticipate from these investments.
we are currently expanding our fort collins facility to support anticipated growth in sales of our proprietary products, particularly for our wireless end market, and to leverage our fixed costs. unanticipated delays in this expansion could result in significant additional costs, and could result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand for the products we plan to manufacture at the expanded facility. if we underestimate customer demand, or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available at this facility to satisfy customers' demands, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. conversely, if we overestimate customer demand we would experience excess capacity at this facility, which would result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue we generate, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
failure to adjust our supply chain volume due to changing market or other conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our results of operations.
we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. the short-term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. our results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our supply chain volume to address market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate, or by other unanticipated events such as natural disasters. in addition, the sale of our products is dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. for example, the
smartphone market is particularly volatile and is subject to seasonality related to the holiday selling season, making demand difficult to anticipate.
severe supply chain disruptions, such as those caused by large scale natural disasters and widespread illnesses, can adversely affect our, and our customers', ability to source materials and components needed to manufacture products. in such event, even if we are able to promptly resume production of our affected products, if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations.
from time to time, customers may require rapid increases in production, for example when they are ramping up for a new product launch, such as a new generation smartphone, which can challenge our resources and reduce margins. we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components or secure sufficient contract manufacturing capacity, including at our own internal manufacturing facilities, to meet such increases in product demand. this could harm our reputation, prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities, reduce revenue growth and subject us to additional liabilities if we are not able to timely satisfy customer orders.
in order to secure components for the production of our products, we may enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors or make advance payments to suppliers, which could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to declining market demands. prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our products has decreased. downturns in the semiconductor industry have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, our customers to reduce significantly the amount of products ordered from us. if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges. conversely, if oems order more of our products in any particular quarter than are ultimately required to satisfy end customer demand, inventories at these oems may grow in such quarter, which could adversely affect our product revenues in a subsequent quarter as such oems would likely reduce future orders until their inventory levels realign with end customer demand. in addition, because certain of our sales, research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may decrease our gross margins and operating income.
we rely on our own internal it systems and on third parties to provide corporate infrastructure services necessary for the operation of our business. any failure of one or more of our vendors to provide these services could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we depend on various it systems, including networks, applications and outsourced services. we rely on third-party vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services, including certain services related to accounting, billing, human resources, benefit plan administration, it network development and network monitoring. the ability of these third-party vendors to successfully provide reliable, high quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control. while we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, our agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive. in addition, we do not know whether we will be able to collect on any award of damages or that any such damages would be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur as a result of any vendor's failure to perform under its agreement with us. upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.
any failure of these systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations by harming our ability to accurately forecast sales demand, manage our supply chain and production facilities, fulfill customer orders, and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.
our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors, including our product mix, customer mix, commodity prices, non-product revenue, acquisitions we may make and level of capacity utilization.
our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, with proprietary products and products sold into our industrial & other target market typically providing higher gross margin than other products. a shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages. in addition, oems are becoming increasingly price conscious when they design semiconductors from third party suppliers into their products. this sensitivity, combined with large oems' purchasing power, can lead to intense price competition among competing suppliers, which may require us to decrease our prices in order to win a design with an oem customer. this can, in turn, adversely affect our gross margin. our margin may also be affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, either directly in the price of the raw materials we buy, or as a result of prices increases passed on to us by our suppliers. we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices, some of which (including gold and fuel prices) are very volatile, and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin.
our gross margin is also affected by the timing and amount of our non-product revenue, including non-refundable payments from customers for research and development projects during product development and ip-related revenue such as licensing royalty payments and revenues from sales of ip. our non-product revenue is generally high margin, but fluctuates significantly from quarter to quarter. businesses or companies that we may acquire from time to time may have different gross margin profiles than us and could, therefore, also affect our overall gross margin.
in addition, semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment, leading to high fixed costs, including depreciation expense. although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do retain some semiconductor fabrication facilities. if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a high level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities, such as depreciation expense, will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins. in the past, we have experienced periods where our gross margins declined due to, among other things, reduced factory utilization resulting from reduced customer demand, reduced selling prices and a change in product mix towards lower margin devices. increased competition and the existence of product alternatives, more complex engineering requirements, lower demand, reductions in our technological lead, compared to our competitors, and other factors may lead to further price erosion, lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future.
if the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated in singapore and other jurisdictions change or cease to be in effect or applicable, in part or in whole, for any reason, or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentive or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect, the amount of corporate income taxes we have to pay could significantly increase.
we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. for example, we have obtained several tax incentives from the singapore economic development board, an agency of the government of singapore, which provide that certain classes of income we earn in singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of singapore income tax. each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. in order to retain these tax benefits in singapore, we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to, among other things, maintenance of a treasury function, a corporate headquarters function, specified ip activities and specified manufacturing activities in singapore. some of these operating conditions are subject to phase-in periods through 2015. the singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between 2015 and 2025. renewals and extensions of such tax incentives are in the discretion of the singapore government, and we may not be able to extend these tax incentive arrangements after their expiration on similar terms or at all. we may also elect not to seek to renew or extend certain tax incentive arrangements. absent these tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. in february 2010, the malaysian government granted us a tax holiday on our qualifying malaysian income, which is effective for 10 years beginning with our fiscal year 2009. the tax incentives that we have negotiated in malaysia and other jurisdictions are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. if we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive, we will lose the related tax benefits. in such event, we could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized by us with respect to that incentive and, depending on the incentive at issue, could likely be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy. any such modified structure or strategy may not be as beneficial to us from an income tax expense or operational perspective as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, the effect of all these tax incentives, in the aggregate, was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately $99 million, $77 million, and $81 million, respectively, and increase diluted net income per share by $0.37, $0.31 and $0.33, respectively.
our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. in addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm's length basis. due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense. we are subject to, and are under, audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our recorded income tax provisions and accruals. the ultimate results of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
we may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party ip rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and loss of our ip rights.
the semiconductor industry is characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of ip rights, including actions by patent-holding companies that do not make or sell products. from time to time, third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other ip rights to technologies that are important to our business.
litigation or settlement of claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate these rights, regardless of their merit, are frequently costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. in addition, many of our customer agreements, and in some cases our asset sale agreements, require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for third-party ip infringement claims, which have required and may in the future require that we defend those claims, and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. we do not know whether we will prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in ip litigation. if any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:
•   cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology and/or make changes to our processes or products;
•   pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology;
•   expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;
•   license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;
•   enter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our overall ip portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product categories;
•   indemnify customers or distributors;
•   pay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or
•   relinquish ip rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable.
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we utilize a significant amount of ip in our business. if we are unable or fail to protect our ip, our business could be adversely affected.
our success depends in part upon protecting our ip. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of ip rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants. we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our ip rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our ip rights valuable to our business. we are unable to predict that:
•   ip rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or, in the case of third-party ip rights, licensed or sub-licensed to us, be licensed to others;
•   our ip rights will provide competitive advantages to us;
•   rights previously granted by third parties to ip rights licensed or assigned to us, including portfolio cross-licenses, will not hamper our ability to assert our ip rights against potential competitors or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes;
•   any of our pending or future patent, trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought; or
•   our ip rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak.
in addition, our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies, duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies. effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions, relative to
those protections available in the united states, may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions. we may elect to abandon or divest patents or otherwise not pursue prosecution of certain pending patent applications, due to strategic concerns or other factors. in addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us.
as part of our acquisition of lsi, we generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain ip we acquired from lsi. from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our ip rights, including, in some cases, against third parties with whom we have ongoing relationships, such as customers and suppliers. conversely, third parties may pursue ip litigation against us, which may increase as a result of our ip licensing business. an adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our ip rights and limit the value of our technology, including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our ip against others. in addition, such legal actions or adverse decisions could otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
from time to time we may need to obtain additional ip licenses or renew existing license agreements. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all.
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our design and technical personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.
our future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel, including our management, sales and marketing, legal and finance personnel, and especially our design and technical personnel. we also seek to acquire talented engineering and technical personnel through acquisitions we may make from time to time. we do not know whether we will be able to retain all of these employees as we continue to pursue our business strategy. we have historically encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers because there is a limited pool of engineers with expertise in analog and optoelectronic semiconductor design. competition for such personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, particularly in southeast asia where qualified engineers are in high demand. in addition, employees of companies or businesses that we acquire may decide not to continue working for us, with little or no notice, for reasons that may include dissatisfaction with our corporate culture, compensation or new roles and responsibilities. as the source of our technological and product innovations, our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset. the loss of the services of key employees, especially our key design and technical personnel, or our inability to retain, attract and motivate qualified design and technical personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability.
from time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that have lead, and may in the future lead, to significant expenses. although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims. conversely, in some cases, amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed.
product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. we may incur costs and expenses in the event of any recall of a customer's product containing one of our devices. the process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources, and we may incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm. our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions, relating to product quality issues. the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant, and in some cases, including in agreements with some of our largest customers, are potentially unlimited. any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenues we receive from the relevant products. costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses or undetected defects or bugs, which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, and materially and adversely affect our operating costs.
highly complex products such as those we offer, may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released, or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development. we have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, such defects, bugs and delays. if any of our products contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to successfully design workarounds. consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers, and our financial results. in addition, these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers. to resolve these problems, we may have to invest significant capital and other resources. although our products are tested by our suppliers, our customers and ourselves, it is possible that
our new products will contain defects or bugs. if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs. these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others. for example, if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer's product delivery, we may be required, under the terms of our agreement with that customer, to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays. in addition, these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts, and we would likely lose, or experience a delay in, market acceptance of the affected product or products, and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers. as a result, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.
we are subject to risks associated with our distributors' product inventories and product sell-through.
we sell many of our products to customers through distributors who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end users. we limit distributor return rights and we allow limited price adjustments on sales to distributors. price adjustments may be effected by way of credits for future product or by cash payments to the distributor either in arrears or in advance based on estimates. we recognize reserves for distributor rights related to these limited stock returns and price adjustments. we recognize revenues for sales to distributors upon delivery to the distributors, net of estimated provisions for these stock return and price adjustment programs. we have extended these programs to certain distributors in the united states, asia and europe and may extend them on a selective basis to some of our other distributors in these geographies. the reserves recognized for these programs are based on significant judgments and estimates, using historical experience rates, inventory levels in distribution, current trends and other factors, and there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates. these programs may require us to deploy a substantial amount of cash to fund them. as of november 2, 2014, we had an aggregate of approximately $34 million on deposit with various distributors to fund these programs. the timing and mix of payments and credits associated with such price adjustments could change over time, which could adversely affect our cash flows. sales to distributors accounted for 25% and 28% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.
if our distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if they decide to decrease their inventories for any reason, such as due to adverse global economic conditions or due to any downturn in technology spending, our sales to these distributors and our revenues may decline. we also face the risk that our distributors may purchase, or for other reasons accumulate, inventory levels of our products in any particular quarter in excess of future anticipated sales to end-customers. if such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these distributors for any reason, these distributors may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods until their inventory levels realign with end customer demand, which would harm our business and could adversely affect our product revenues in such subsequent periods. our reserve estimates associated with products stocked by our distributors are based largely on reports that our distributors provide to us on a weekly or monthly basis. to date, we believe this data has been generally accurate. to the extent that this resale and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received in a timely manner, we may not be able to make reserve estimates for future periods accurately or at all.
we do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products sold through distributors. as a result, our products may be used in or for applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, including, for example, medical devices, and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications. in such event, failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us, damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations.
unless we and our suppliers continuously improve manufacturing efficiency and quality, our financial performance could be adversely affected.
manufacturing semiconductors involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment. we and our suppliers, as well as our competitors, continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance. defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields and increase costs. our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future financial performance, and we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors. for products that we outsource manufacturing, our product yields and performance will be subject to the manufacturing efficiencies of our third-party suppliers.
from time to time, we and our suppliers have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities, transferring production to other facilities, achieving and maintaining a high level of process quality and effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes, all of which have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields. we and our suppliers may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, transferring production to other facilities, upgrading or expanding existing facilities, including our fort collins facility, or changing our process technologies, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues. our results of operations could be adversely affected by any increase in costs related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately.
our effective tax rates may be adversely affected by reorganization or restructuring of our businesses, jurisdictional revenue mix, and changes in tax regulations or policy, which could materially, adversely affect financial results.
we are a singapore-based multinational company subject to tax in various tax jurisdictions. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by the reorganization of businesses or assets that we may acquire or divest, or by the timing of such events, including for example, the integration and reorganization initiatives that we are undertaking as a result of our recent acquisitions, and by resulting changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. in addition, our effective tax rates may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in the jurisdictional mix of revenues earned, and the relevant tax rates in those jurisdictions. unanticipated changes in the tax rates, or tax policies of the countries in which we operate, could also adversely affect our future results of operations. any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our income tax expense, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.
the enactment of legislation implementing changes in u.s. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other international tax reform policies or principles could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
tax bills are introduced from time to time to reform u.s. taxation of international business activities. depending on the final form of legislation enacted, if any, these consequences may be significant for us due to the large scale of our international business activities. if any of these proposals are enacted into legislation, or if other international, consensus-based tax policies and principles are amended or implemented, they could have material adverse consequences on the amount of tax we pay and thereby on our financial position and results of operations.
we make substantial investments in research and development to improve existing and develop new technologies to keep pace with technological advances and to remain competitive in our business, and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, short product cycles and evolving industry standards, and requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products. in addition, semiconductor products transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries. this requires us to adapt our products and manufacturing processes to these new technologies, which requires expertise in new procedures. our failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry process technologies could impair our competitive position. in order to remain competitive, we have made significant investments in research and development, and anticipate that we will need to maintain or increase our levels of research and development expenditures. we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future, due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop. if we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new technologies that we do not support and that compete with technologies we do support become widely accepted, demand for our current and planned products may be reduced. significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, increased investments in research and development could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.
our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy.
our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, in particular, the services of mr. hock e. tan, our president and chief executive officer, and mr. bryan t. ingram, our senior vice president and chief operating officer. none of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period. in addition, we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management. the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.
we sell our products throughout the world. in addition, as of november 2, 2014, approximately 53% of our employees are located outside of the united states. multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. these factors include:
•   changes in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions;
•   restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs;
•   disruptions of capital and trading markets;
•   changes in import or export licensing requirements;
•   civil disturbances or political instability;
•   geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups;
•   changes in labor standards;
•   limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our ip;
•   nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets;
•   changes in tax laws;
•   currency fluctuations, which may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers or foreign-sourced materials and services becoming more expensive for us; and
•   difficulty in obtaining distribution and support.
a significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with various and differing anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar laws in china. in addition, the anti-corruption laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may, in some cases, conflict with each other. our code of ethics and business conduct and other policies prohibit us and our employees from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and from engaging in unethical business practices, including kick-backs to or from purely private parties. however, there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of this and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures. any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.
a majority of our products are produced and sourced in asia, including in china, malaysia, the philippines, singapore, south korea, taiwan and thailand. as a result of the acquisition of lsi, we also have personnel in, and conduct business from, india, an area in which we have not previously operated. any conflict or uncertainty in these countries, including due to political or civil unrest, public health or safety concerns or natural disasters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, if the government of any country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards for products manufactured in or imported into their country that are not widely shared, it may lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, our subsidiaries may require future equity-related financing, and any capital contributions to certain of our subsidiaries may require the approval of the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which the subsidiary is incorporated. the approvals are required from the investment commissions or similar agency of the particular jurisdiction and relate to any initial or additional equity investment by foreign entities in local corporations. our failure to obtain the required approvals and our resulting inability to provide such equity-related financing or capital contributions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we may not realize the full benefits of our research and development grants.
we have accepted research and development grants, the receipt and amount of which are subject to our compliance with specified terms and conditions, both individually and in the aggregate. during fiscal year 2014, we recognized credits of $3 million to research and development expense and $1 million as a deferred credit for capital expenditures pursuant to these grants. during fiscal year 2013, we recognized credits of $11 million to research and development expense and $2 million as a deferred credit for capital expenditures pursuant to these grants. if we cannot or elect not to satisfy the terms and conditions of any of these grants, expenses incurred in respect of the relevant research and development projects will not be approved for reimbursement, we may be required to return amounts previously paid to us under the grants and further grants may not be available to us in the future. in the event we are unable to comply with the terms of any such grant, we may seek to amend the terms. however, any amendment, extension or renewal of such grants is in the discretion of the granting authority and we may not be able to effect any such change.
our business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses. if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
our business is subject to various significant international and u.s. laws and other legal requirements, including packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. these regulations are complex, change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time. we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. in addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.
our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the international standards organization, as well as regulation by other agencies, such as the u.s. federal communications commission. if we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations, our business could be harmed.
we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, we could be required to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.
we are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, which could increase our costs, restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we are subject to a variety of international and u.s. laws and other legal requirements relating to the use, disposal, clean-up of and human exposure to, hazardous materials. any failure by us to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to future liabilities in excess of our reserves. in addition, compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment, incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes. in the event of the discovery of new contamination, additional requirements with respect to existing contamination, or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible, we may be required to take remedial or other measures which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that apply to specified electronics products sold in the european union as of july 1, 2006 under the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive. other countries, such as the united states, china and japan, have enacted or may enact laws or regulations similar to the eu legislation. other environmental regulations may require us to re-engineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentally compatible. such re-engineering and component substitution may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements, we may in the future incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by government agencies and private parties. we may be defendants in lawsuits brought by parties in the future alleging environmental damage, personal injury or property damage. a significant judgment against us could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in the last few years, there has been increased media scrutiny and associated reports focusing on a potential link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments and certain illnesses, primarily different types of cancers. regulatory agencies and industry associations have begun to study the issue to see if any actual correlation exists. because we utilize clean rooms, we may become subject to liability claims. in addition, these reports may also affect our ability to recruit and retain employees.
•   changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations;
•   the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted;
•   our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities; or
•   the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims, including the cost of clean-up of currently unknown environmental conditions, particularly at sites that we may acquire from time to time.
social and environmental responsibility regulations, policies and provisions, including, for example, regulations related to "conflict minerals," may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers.
there is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry, particularly with oems that manufacture consumer electronics. a number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions that their suppliers should comply with, or they seek to include such provisions in their procurement terms and conditions. an increasing number of participants in the semiconductor industry are also joining voluntary social responsibility initiatives such as the u.n. global compact, a voluntary initiative for businesses to develop, implement and disclose sustainability policies and practices. these social and environmental responsibility provisions and initiatives are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing. if we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers or contract manufacturers to comply, with such policies or provisions, a customer may stop purchasing products from us, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenues and results of operations.
we are subject to rules adopted by the sec requiring us to disclose whether certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, used in our products originate from the democratic republic of congo and its adjoining countries, or the drc region. in addition, as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs, an increasing number of oems are seeking to source products that do not contain conflict minerals sourced from the drc region. this could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products. since our supply chain is complex, we are not currently able to definitively ascertain the origins of all of these minerals and metals used in our products. as a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers' demands, which may harm our sales and operating results.
the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future, which could harm our revenues and gross profits.
the products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications. as a result, the prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly. gross profits on our products may be negatively affected by, among other things, pricing pressures from our customers, and the proportion of sales of our wireless and other products into consumer application markets, which are highly competitive and cost sensitive. in the past, we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors. in addition, some of our customer agreements provide for volume-based pricing and product pricing roadmaps, which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time. our gross margin and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, reducing manufacturing costs, or developing new and higher value-added products on a timely basis.
we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and ultimately have an adverse effect on our share price.
we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually, as required by section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act. our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of november 2, 2014 did not include the internal controls of lsi, which we acquired in may 2014, and plx, which we acquired in august 2014. even though, as of november 2, 2014, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting, excluding lsi and plx, was effective, we need to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes. this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section 404 is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section 404. furthermore, as we grow our business or acquire other businesses, including lsi and plx, our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, either in our existing business or in businesses that we may acquire, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline.
remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, the trading price of our ordinary shares may
decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the sec or the nasdaq global select market. we may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods.
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by employee-benefit related costs and expenses.
we sponsor several defined benefit plans and post-retirement medical benefit plans. we are required to make contributions to these plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing these employee benefit plans. the difference between the obligations and assets of these plans, or the funded status of these plans, is a significant factor in determining our pension expense and the ongoing funding requirements of these plans. weak economic conditions and related under-performance of asset markets could lead to increased pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. in the united states, we also self-fund our employees' health benefits. the costs of providing these benefits are unpredictable and have been increasing steadily and significantly in recent years. also, a significant portion of our employees' cash compensation is performance-related, based on achievement of annual metrics, which can cause significant fluctuations in our employee compensation expense, and in cash flows in the period in which payment occurs. significant increases in the costs of the benefits we provide to our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
as a result of the lsi acquisition, we assumed defined benefit pension plans under which we are obligated to make future contributions to fund benefits to participants. most benefit accruals under the plans were frozen in 2009. the projected benefit obligations under these pension plans exceeded the value of the assets of those plans by approximately $440 million as of november 2, 2014. we expect to have additional funding requirements with respect to the plans in future years, and we may also choose to make additional, voluntary contributions to the plans. depending on our cash position at the time, any such funding of, or contributions to, our pension plans could impact our operating flexibility and financial position, including adversely affecting our cash flows and results of operations for the quarter in which they are made.
in order to reduce the expense associated with these programs, where practicable, we are seeking to move defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans, or to cash out future retirees not yet receiving benefits, and to replace existing pension obligations with annuities. any such changes may adversely affect our results of operations, including our profitability and cash flows.
a breach of our security systems may have a material adverse effect on our business.
our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and protect our customers', suppliers' and employees' confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information. however, we are also dependent on a number of third-party "cloud-based" service providers of critical corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communication services and certain finance functions, and we are, of necessity, dependent on the security systems of these providers. accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to our facilities, our information systems or the systems of our cloud-based service providers or the existence of computer viruses in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information. any theft or misuse of such information could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, difficulty in marketing our products, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition. since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
risks relating to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.
as a result of our acquisition of lsi, we have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding, consisting of a $4.6 billion floating rate, senior collateralized term loan from a syndicate of financial institutions, or the term loans, pursuant to a new credit agreement, or the 2014 credit agreement, and $1 billion of our 2% convertible senior notes due 2021, or the convertible notes. the 2014 credit agreement relating to the term loans also provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility that permits us to borrow up to $500 million, from time to time, for general corporate purposes, or the 2014 revolving credit facility. the borrowers' obligations under the 2014 credit agreement are guaranteed by a number of our subsidiaries and are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by all the assets of the borrowers, and each subsidiary guarantor. subject to restrictions in the 2014 credit agreement, we may incur additional indebtedness.
•   making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our convertible notes, including our repurchase obligations;
•   increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;
•   requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, execution of our business strategy, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry;
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;
•   making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes.
the substantial majority of our debt will become due and payable at the end of its relevant seven-year term. in addition, if we were to experience a change of control, this would trigger an event of default under the credit agreement, which would permit the lenders to immediately declare the loans due and payable in whole or in part. in either such event, we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due, or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all. any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix and commodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost of future debt and may adversely affect our share price. failure to maintain a public corporate credit rating from each of standard & poor's and moody's may result in a default under the 2014 credit agreement.
our 2014 credit agreement imposes significant restrictions on our business.
the 2014 credit agreement contains a number of covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business. these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. the restrictions placed on us include limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to:
•   incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred or redeemable shares;
•   consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets;
•   make investments, acquisitions, loans or advances or guarantee indebtedness;
•   transfer or sell certain assets;
•   engage in sale and lease back transactions;
•   engage in transactions with affiliates; and
in addition, if, on the last day of any test period, the 2014 revolving credit facility is drawn by more than 30% (other than with respect to undrawn letters of credit in an amount of up to $25 million), the 2014 credit agreement requires us to meet a first lien leverage ratio test. our ability to meet this financial covenant may be affected by events beyond our control, and we do not know whether we will be able to maintain this ratio.
the foregoing restrictions could limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in market conditions or our capital needs. we do not know whether we will be granted waivers under, or amendments to, our 2014 credit agreement or the indenture relating to the convertible notes, or the indenture, if for any reason we are unable to meet these requirements, or whether we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing our convertible notes or our 2014 credit agreement. in addition, the 2014 credit agreement and the indenture contain cross-default provisions which could thereby result in an acceleration of amounts outstanding under all those debt instruments if certain events of
default occur under any of them. if we are unable to repay these amounts, lenders having secured obligations, including the lenders under our 2014 credit agreement, could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. any of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, to refinance our debt, and to make interest payments or other payments upon conversion of the convertible notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the 2014 credit agreement, the convertible notes and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. if we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the convertible notes or future indebtedness.
holders may convert their convertible notes at their option at any time prior to the scheduled maturity of the convertible notes. upon conversion of the convertible notes, we may elect to deliver ordinary shares, cash or a combination of cash and shares in respect of the principal amounts thereof. any conversion of the convertible notes prior to their maturity, or acceleration of the repayment of the convertible notes or future indebtedness after any applicable notice or grace periods could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and financial condition. even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the convertible notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. in addition, holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for the convertible notes converted in connection with such a make-whole fundamental change. if we are required to make repurchases of convertible notes surrendered therefor or elect to pay cash in respect of convertible notes being converted, it may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and on our results of operations, particularly for the period in which any such payment is made. in addition, our ability to repurchase the convertible notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the convertible notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. our failure to repurchase convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the convertible notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.
risks relating to investments in singapore companies it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of u.s. courts for civil liabilities under u.s. federal securities laws against us, our directors or officers in singapore.
we are incorporated under the laws of the republic of singapore, and certain of our officers and directors are resident outside the united states. moreover, a majority of our consolidated assets are located outside the united states. although we are incorporated outside the united states, we have agreed to accept service of process in the united states through our agent designated for that purpose. nevertheless, since a majority of the consolidated assets owned by us are located outside the united states, any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible within the united states.
there is no treaty between the united states and singapore providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the federal securities laws, would, therefore, not be automatically enforceable in singapore. there is doubt whether a singapore court may impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers who reside in singapore in a suit brought in the singapore courts against us or such persons with respect to a violation solely of the federal securities laws of the united states, unless the facts surrounding such a violation would constitute or give rise to a cause of action under singapore law. consequently, it may be difficult for investors to enforce against us, our directors or our officers in singapore judgments obtained in the united states, which are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states.
we are incorporated in singapore and our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states, and we may have more difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executives.
our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the laws governing corporations incorporated in singapore. the rights of our shareholders and the responsibilities of the members of our board of directors, or our board, under singapore law are different from those applicable to a corporation incorporated in the united states. therefore, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest in connection with actions taken by our management or members of our board than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states. legislation that would make significant changes to the singapore companies act has recently been passed by the singapore authorities, some of which alter the rights of shareholders that are currently provided under the singapore companies act and our memorandum and articles of association. however, it is not yet certain when such amendments will become effective.
in addition, being a public company incorporated in singapore may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board, particularly to serve on committees of our board, and qualified executive officers.
for a limited period of time, our directors have general authority to allot and issue new ordinary shares on terms and conditions as may be determined by our board in its sole discretion.
under singapore law, we may only allot and issue new ordinary shares with the prior approval of our shareholders in a general meeting. at our 2014 annual general meeting of shareholders, or agm, our shareholders provided our directors with the general authority to allot and issue any number of new ordinary shares until the earlier of (i) the conclusion of our 2015 agm, (ii) the expiration of the period within which the next annual general meeting is required to be held (i.e. within 15 months from the conclusion of the last general meeting) or (iii) the subsequent revocation or modification of such general authority by our shareholders acting at a duly noticed and convened meeting. subject to the general authority to allot and issue new ordinary shares provided by our shareholders, the provisions of the singapore companies act and our memorandum and articles of association, our board may allot and issue new ordinary shares on terms and conditions as they may think fit to impose. any additional issuances of new ordinary shares by our directors may adversely impact the market price of our ordinary shares.
risks relating to owning our ordinary shares at times, our share price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future, which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.
the trading price of our ordinary shares has, at times, fluctuated significantly. the trading price of our ordinary shares could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many of the risk factors listed in this "risk factors" section, and others, many of which are beyond our control, including:
•   actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;
•   issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;
•   fluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant customers as well as companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;
•   announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors;
•   announcements of, or expectations of additional debt or equity financing efforts;
•   changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies.
these fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. these broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares. you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. we may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. we are also the subject of a number of lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions of lsi and plx. securities litigation against us, including the lawsuits related to the lsi and plx transactions, could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.
under the terms of the convertible notes, we may elect to settle any conversions of the convertible notes in ordinary shares, cash or a combination of cash and shares. while we currently intend to settle any such conversions in cash, we may be unable or may elect not to do so. in such event, the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes into our ordinary shares will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders, to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the convertible notes. based on the current effective conversion price, if all the convertible notes were converted into ordinary shares, this would result in the issuance of approximately 20.8 million additional shares. the convertible notes are convertible at any time and any sales in the public market of the ordinary shares issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our ordinary shares. in addition, the existence of the convertible notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into our ordinary shares could depress the price of our ordinary shares.
the fundamental change and make-whole fundamental change provisions of the convertible notes, and the change of control provisions of our 2014 credit agreement may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.
the fundamental change purchase rights, which allow holders of our convertible notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in certain other circumstances, as well as the change of control provisions of the 2014 credit agreement, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders or investors in the convertible notes.
a substantial amount of our shares are held by a small number of institutional investors and significant sales of our ordinary shares in the public market by one or more of these holders could cause our share price to fall.
as of september 30, 2014, we believe that our five largest shareholders are institutional investors and that they hold over 39% of our outstanding ordinary shares in the aggregate. these institutional investors may sell their shares for a variety of reasons, including dissatisfaction with our short- or long-term results. these holders may sell their shares at any time and such sales could depress the market price of our ordinary shares, given the large amounts of our shares held by these investors. such sales could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.
our board has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which the company currently pays a cash dividend on our ordinary shares on a quarterly basis. the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. our 2013 share repurchase program expired on april 8, 2014, and as of the date of this annual report on form 10-k, our board has not authorized a new program. there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends or repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts, or at all. furthermore, we may declare dividends as interim dividends, which are wholly provisional under singapore law and may be revoked by our board at any time prior to the payment thereof. future dividends and share repurchases, if any, their timing and amount, as well as the relative allocation of cash between dividends and share repurchases, may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; earnings levels; contractual restrictions; cash position and overall financial condition; and changes to our business model. the payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law, contractual restrictions and our corporate structure. pursuant to singapore law and our articles of association, no dividends may be paid except out of our profits. also, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares and to repurchase our shares is limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries, including restrictions under the terms of our 2014 credit agreement.
singapore corporate law may impede a takeover of our company by a third-party, which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares.
the singapore code on take-overs and mergers contains provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a future takeover or change in control of our company for so long as we remain a public company with more than 50 shareholders and net tangible assets of s$5 million or more. any person acquiring an interest, whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not, either on their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person, in 30% or more of our voting shares, or, if such person holds, either on their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person, between 30% and 50% (both inclusive) of our voting shares, and such person (or parties acting in concert with such person) acquires additional voting shares representing more than 1% of our voting shares in any six-month period, must, except with the consent of the securities industry council in singapore, extend a mandatory takeover offer for the remaining voting shares in accordance with the provisions of the singapore code on take-overs and mergers. while the singapore code on take-overs and mergers seeks to ensure equality of treatment among shareholders, its provisions may discourage or prevent certain types of transactions
involving an actual or threatened change of control of our company. these legal requirements may impede or delay a takeover of our company by a third-party, which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares.
from time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management's estimates as of the date of release. this guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release. our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants, and neither any independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles, examines or reviews the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. we generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. the principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.
guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results, particularly any guidance relating to the results of operations of acquired businesses or companies, such as lsi and plx, as our management will, necessarily, be less familiar with their business, procedures and operations. accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material. investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. in light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.
any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this annual report on form 10-k could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with "selected financial data" and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption "risk factors" or in other parts of this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we are a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on analog iii-v based products and complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices. we have a history of innovation and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as smartphones, hard disk drives, computer servers, consumer appliances, data networking and telecommunications equipment, enterprise storage and servers, and factory automation and industrial equipment. we have four reportable segments: wireless communications, wired infrastructure, enterprise storage and industrial & other, which align with our target markets. we differentiate ourselves through our high performance design and integration capabilities and focus on developing products for target markets where we believe we can earn attractive margins.
original equipment manufacturers, or oems, or their contract manufacturers, and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales. we have established strong relationships with leading oem customers across multiple target markets and we have a direct sales force focused on supporting large oems. we also distribute a substantial portion of our products through our broad distribution network, and a significant amount of these sales are to large global electronic components distributors, including avnet, inc. and arrow electronics, inc. we have a diversified and well-established base of thousands of end customers, located throughout the world, which we serve through our multi-channel sales and fulfillment system.
the demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including the following:
•   general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and in our target markets;
•   our ability to define specifications for, develop or acquire, complete, introduce and market, new products and technologies in a cost-effective and timely manner;
•   the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;
•   the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets, and the rate at which our customers' products that include our technology are accepted in their markets; and
•   the qualification, availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products.
current uncertainty in global economic conditions, including the economic recovery in the united states and the level of growth in china, still poses significant risks to our business. for example, customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news, which would in turn negatively affect product demand and our results of operations.
net revenue substantially all of our net revenue is derived from sales of semiconductor devices that our customers incorporate into electronic products. our four reportable segments are wireless communications, wired infrastructure, enterprise storage and industrial & other, which align with our target markets. applications for our products in these segments include smartphones, hard disk drives, or hdds, computer servers, consumer appliances, data networking and telecommunications equipment, enterprise storage and servers, factory automation and industrial equipment. the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in each of our segments varies from fiscal quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-market demand, including the effects of seasonality. the first fiscal quarter has historically been our lowest revenue and cash generating quarter due, in part, to holiday shut downs at many oem customers and distributors, and the first half of the fiscal year has tended to generate lower revenue than the second half of the fiscal year. however, in recent periods typical seasonality and industry cyclicality have been increasingly overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects, the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems, particularly in the wireless communications and enterprise storage segments.
we use distributors for a significant portion of our business and recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances. historically, a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. sales to distributors accounted for 25% and 28% of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended november 2, 2014
and november 3, 2013, respectively. during the fiscal year ended november 2, 2014, or fiscal year 2014, foxconn technology group companies, or foxconn, accounted for 20% of our net revenue, and our top direct ten customers, which included three distributors, collectively accounted for 57% of our net revenue. during the fiscal year ended november 3, 2013, or fiscal year 2013, foxconn accounted for 18% of our net revenue and our top ten customers, which included three distributors, collectively accounted for 64% of our net revenue. we believe our aggregate sales to apple, inc., when our direct sales to it are combined with sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for both fiscal years 2014 and 2013. we believe our aggregate sales to cisco systems inc., when our direct sales to it are combined with sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues for fiscal year 2013. we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. the loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top ten direct or indirect customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
costs and expenses total cost of products sold.  cost of products sold consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers and other materials, and the cost of assembly and testing of those products. cost of products sold also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, including share-based compensation, and related occupancy, computer services and equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty and inventory adjustments, including write-downs for inventory obsolescence, energy costs, other manufacturing expenses and acquisition-related costs. total cost of products sold also includes amortization of intangible assets and restructuring charges.
although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we also have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication and assembly and test facilities. if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication and assembly and test facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.
research and development.  research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including share-based compensation expense. these expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expenses, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses, computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process and acquisition-related costs.
selling, general and administrative.  selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including share-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, costs of advertising, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs. general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs and other corporate expenses.
amortization of intangible assets.  in connection with acquisitions, we recorded intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 year to 25 years. we also recorded goodwill and in-process research and development, which are not amortized, in connection with acquisitions.
restructuring charges. restructuring charges consist primarily of compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalizing product development program costs, fixed asset impairments, facility and lease abandonments and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.
interest expense. concurrent with the acquisition of lsi corporation, or lsi, we issued $1 billion principal amount of our 2% convertible senior notes due 2021, or the convertible notes. we also entered into a senior secured credit agreement with a group of banks, or the 2014 credit agreement, pursuant to which we borrowed $4.6 billion of term loans, or the term loans, to fund the lsi acquisition, and which provided for a $500 million senior secured, revolving credit facility, or the 2014 revolving credit facility. this facility replaced our prior $575 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or 2013 credit facility. interest expense in fiscal year 2014 included coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of the discount associated with the convertible notes and amortization of debt issuance costs related to the 2014 credit agreement and the 2014 revolving credit facility. interest expense in fiscal year 2013 included commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the 2013 credit facility.
other income (expense), net.  other income (expense), net includes net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, realized and unrealized gains on trading securities, gains on the sale of investments, interest income, gains (losses) on currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items.
provision for income taxes.  we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. for example, we have obtained
several tax incentives from the singapore economic development board, an agency of the government of singapore, which provide that certain classes of income we earn in singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of singapore income tax. each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. in order to retain these tax benefits in singapore, we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to, among other things, maintenance of a treasury function, a corporate headquarters function, specified intellectual property, or ip, activities and specified manufacturing activities in singapore. some of these operating conditions are subject to phase-in periods through 2015. the singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between 2015 and 2025, subject in certain cases to potential extensions. renewals and extensions of such tax incentives are in the discretion of the singapore government, and we may not be able to extend these tax incentive arrangements after their expiration on similar terms or at all. we may elect not to seek to renew or extend certain tax incentive arrangements. absent such tax incentives, the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. in february 2010, the malaysian government granted us a tax holiday on our qualifying malaysian income, which is effective for 10 years beginning with our fiscal year 2009. the tax incentives that we have negotiated in malaysia and other jurisdictions are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. if we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive, we will lose the related tax benefits. in such event, we could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized by us with respect to that incentive and, depending on the incentive at issue, could likely be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy. any such modified structure may not be as beneficial to us from an income tax expense or operational perspective as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements. as a result of the tax incentives and tax holidays we have obtained, if we continue to comply with their respective operating conditions, we expect the income from our operations to be subject to relatively lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary income tax rules. for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, the effect of all these tax incentives was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes by approximately $99 million, $77 million and $81 million, respectively.
our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. in addition, taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm's length basis. due to inconsistencies in application of the arm's length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense.
going forward, our effective tax rate will vary based on a variety of factors, including overall profitability, the geographical mix of income before income taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate, as well as discrete events, such as settlements of future audits and acquisitions we may make from time to time. in particular, we may owe significant taxes in jurisdictions outside singapore during periods when we are profitable in those jurisdictions even though we may be experiencing low operating profit or operating losses on a consolidated basis, potentially resulting in significant tax liabilities on a consolidated basis during those periods. our historical provision for income taxes is not necessarily reflective of our future results of operations.
acquisitions, divestitures and investments acquisitions plx technology, inc.
on august 12, 2014, we acquired plx technology, inc., or plx, a provider of pci express semiconductor and software connectivity solutions, for approximately $308 million, which included cash paid to plx shareholders of $299 million and cash paid for fully vested stock options and restricted stock units of $9 million. we funded the transaction with available cash.
lsi corporation on may 6, 2014, we acquired lsi, a company that provides high-performance storage and networking semiconductors used in hdd, solid state drives, communication systems, computer servers, storage systems and personal computers, through a merger of lsi into one of our indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries. the aggregate consideration for the acquisition was approximately $6,518 million, which included cash paid to lsi stockholders of $6,344 million, cash paid for fully vested stock options and restricted stock units of $154 million and $20 million for the fair value of partially vested assumed equity awards. we funded the transaction with the proceeds from the issuance of $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes, the proceeds from $4.6 billion in term loans borrowed under the 2014 credit agreement entered at the closing of the transaction, as well as cash on hand of the combined companies.
on june 28, 2013, we acquired cyoptics, inc., or cyoptics, a u.s.-based company that manufactures and sells indium phosphide, optical chip and component technologies for the data communications and telecommunications markets for approximately $377 million, of which $373 million was paid in cash, net of $3 million in cash acquired. during fiscal year 2014, we also paid $4 million of additional deferred consideration to the previous shareholders of cyoptics. in addition, approximately $27 million was payable to key employees of cyoptics as part of a retention bonus plan. this amount was paid into escrow, will be paid to those employees over a three-year period subsequent to the acquisition date and is being recognized as compensation expense over the same period. for eligible cyoptics employees whose employment is involuntarily terminated by the company, their retention bonus payments are accelerated and due in full upon such termination in accordance with the provisions of the plan. during fiscal year 2014, we recognized compensation expense of $10 million due to the departure of certain plan participants. as of november 2, 2014, $17 million of the total $27 million had been paid to eligible cyoptics employees.
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates. (see note 3. "acquisitions and investments")
divestitures sale of lsi's flash components division and accelerated solutions division on september 2, 2014, we sold our lsi flash components division and accelerated solutions division, or the flash business, to seagate technology llc for $450 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $18 million.
sale of the lsi axxia networking business on august 13, 2014, we and intel corporation, or intel, announced the signing of a definitive agreement for intel to acquire lsi's axxia networking business and related assets, or the axxia business, for $650 million. the transaction closed on november 18, 2014.
investments as a result of the acquisition of lsi on may 6, 2014, we acquired a 51% equity interest in a joint venture, silicon manufacturing partners pte ltd., or smp, owned by us and globalfoundries, a manufacturing foundry for integrated circuits. smp operates an ic manufacturing facility in singapore. we account for our ownership position in smp under the equity method of accounting. as of november 2, 2014, the carrying amount of our equity interest in this entity was $22 million. the equity interest is reported in other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheet.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states, or gaap, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. those policies include revenue recognition, business combinations, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, inventory valuation and warranty reserves, accounting for income taxes, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation and employee bonus programs.
revenue recognition.  we recognize revenue related to sales of our products, net of sales returns and allowances, provided that (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred and title and risk of loss have transferred, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. we consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments or when any such adjustments can be estimated. we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance of an order. revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors, is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances. we recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon delivery of product to the distributors. an allowance for distributor credits, covering price adjustments and scrap allowances, is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as consideration of prevailing economic conditions and contractual terms. to date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates. however, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates. different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results.
we enter into development agreements with some of our customers and recognize revenue from these agreements upon completion and acceptance by the customer of contract deliverables or as services are provided, depending on the terms of the arrangement. revenue is deferred for any amounts billed or received prior to completion of milestones or delivery of services. as we retain the ip generated from these development agreements, costs related to these arrangements are included in research and development expense.
we recognize revenue from the sale and licensing of our ip when the following fundamental criteria are met:(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured. revenue from upfront payments for the licensing of our patents is recognized when the arrangement is mutually signed, if there is no future delivery or future performance obligation and all other criteria are met. revenue from guaranteed royalty streams are recognized when paid, or collection is reasonably assured and all other criteria are met. when patent licensing arrangements include royalties for future sales of the licensees' products using our licensed patented technology, revenue is recognized when the royalty report is received from the licensee, at which time the sales price is fixed or determinable, provided that all other criteria have been met.
accounting for business combinations. we use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at their fair values on the date acquired. this requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we adjust the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed, and discount rates. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill.  we assess the impairment of long-lived assets including business combinations related in-process research and development, assets, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. factors we consider important, and which could trigger an impairment review of our long-lived and intangible assets, include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. an impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset. the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between the net book value of the asset (or asset group) and the estimated fair value.
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the relative fair value of the future benefits of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit. reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in note 10, segment information in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k.
we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist, and we follow the two-step approach in performing the impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets. the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the related carrying amount. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit's goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. if the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss, if any. the second step of the test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill, determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, with the carrying amount of such goodwill. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill
exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. our goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. the income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performance including revenues, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. these estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical data and various internal estimates. projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows. the market approach is based on weighting financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. a reporting unit's carry value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash and debt.
for fiscal year 2014, we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill, it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded its carrying value. as a result, we concluded that no impairment of goodwill was identified based on the annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets under the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets such as ours, is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment. in order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects about our business or the part of our business that the long-lived asset relates to, consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business, which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years. based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long-lived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value. assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.
inventory valuation and warranty reserves.  we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory, with cost being determined under the first-in, first-out method. we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements. demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period. a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. in addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. additionally, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold. therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations. we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized. although we engage in extensive product quality control programs and processes, our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates, product recalls, repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure, as well as possible claims for consequential costs. should actual product failure rates, use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty reserves could be required. in that event, our gross margins would be reduced.
accounting for income taxes.  we account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances. if we determine, in the future, that a valuation allowance is required, such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. conversely, if we determine, in the future, a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement, such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. in evaluating the exposure associated
with various tax filing positions, we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in singapore and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed, a further charge to expense would be required. if the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist.
the gross unrecognized tax benefit increased by $450 million during fiscal year 2014 to $487 million as of november 2, 2014 from $37 million as of november 3, 2013. the gross unrecognized tax benefit as of october 28, 2012 was $27 million.
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes line in the consolidated statements of operations. accrued interest and penalties are included within the other long-term liabilities line in the consolidated balance sheets. as of november 2, 2014 and november 3, 2013, the combined amount of cumulative accrued interest and penalties was approximately $23 million and $4 million, respectively.
retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.  retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs over the employees' average expected future service to the company, based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap. one critical assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated costs. other important assumptions include the expected long-term return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rate, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. we evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the relevant measurement dates - november 2, 2014 and november 3, 2013, for both u.s. and non-u.s. plans, in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. for fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the u.s. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high quality corporate bond yields. the discount rate for non-u.s. plans was based either on published rates for government bonds or use of a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high quality corporate bond yields, depending on the availability of sufficient quantities of quality corporate bonds. lower discount rates increase present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pension expense.
we base our salary increase assumptions on historical experience and future expectations. in developing the expected rate of return, we consider long-term compound annualized returns based on historical market data, historical and expected returns on the various categories of plan assets, and the target investment portfolio allocation among debt, equity securities and other investments.
the expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. plan assets are valued at fair value. a 25 basis point change in the estimated long-term return on plan assets for 2014 assumptions would result in a $2.9 million impact on pension expense for fiscal year 2014.
for fiscal year 2014, we used an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.3% for our u.s. pension plans. for our u.s. post-retirement benefit plan, we used a weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets of 5.4%. for the u.s. plans, we used a calculated market-related value of assets, or mrva, in determining the estimated return on plan assets. under the mrva, gains and losses are recognized over a five-year period. the mrva also affects the determination of amortization of gains or losses. as of november 2, 2014, both the mrva and fair value of the plans was $1,180 million. if we used the fair value, the net periodic benefit cost would remain the same for 2014.
actuarial assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment. material changes may occur in retirement benefit costs in the future if these assumptions differ from actual events or experience. we performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is the key assumption in calculating pension and post-retirement benefit obligation as of november 2, 2014. each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have had an estimated $49 million impact on the benefit obligation as of november 2, 2014. each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption and expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated change of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, on annual net retirement benefit costs for fiscal year 2014.
excluding curtailments and settlements, we recorded $2 million of net periodic retirement and post-retirement benefit income recorded in consolidated statement of operations in fiscal year 2014. the net periodic retirement and post-retirement
benefit costs recorded in consolidated statement of operations, excluding curtailments and settlements, were $6 million in fiscal year 2013 and $7 million in fiscal year 2012.
share-based compensation expense.  share-based compensation expense consists of expense for stock options and restricted share units, or rsus, granted to both employees and non-employees as well as expense associated with avago technologies limited employee share purchase plan, or espp. we recognize compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using black-scholes valuation model with a straight-line amortization method. since authoritative guidance requires that share-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated share-based compensation expense for such awards has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on share-based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.
in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, the company began granting share price performance options, which are accounted for as market-based stock options. the fair value of these market-based option awards is estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model. assumptions utilized in the monte carlo simulation model follow the same methodology as our time-based option awards. compensation expense for market-based option awards is amortized based upon a graded vesting method and is recognized if the service period is met even if the market condition is not met.
the dividend yields for fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012 are based on the historical and expected dividend payouts as of the respective option grant dates. for fiscal year 2014, expected volatility for time-based and market-based options was based on our own historical share price volatility or combining historical volatility of guideline publicly-traded companies and our own historical share price volatility over the period commensurate with the expected life of the awards and the implied volatility from our own traded ordinary shares with a term of 180 days measured at a specific date. for fiscal year 2013, expected volatility was based on the combination of historical volatility of guideline publicly-traded companies and our own historical share price volatility over the period commensurate with the expected life of the awards and the implied volatility from traded options in guideline publicly-traded companies and our own shares with a term of 720 days or greater measured over the last three months. for fiscal year 2012, expected volatility was based on the combination of historical volatility of our previous group of guideline publicly-traded companies over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options and the implied volatility of guideline publicly-traded companies from traded options with a term of 180 days or greater measured over the last three months. the risk-free interest rate is derived from the average u.s. treasury strips rate during the period, which approximates the rate in effect at the time of grant. for fiscal year 2014, the expected term for time-based options was based on a weighted-average combining the average life of options that have already been exercised or cancelled with the expected life of all unexercised options. the expected life for unexercised options is calculated assuming that the options will be exercised at the midpoint of the vesting date (if unvested) or the valuation date (if vested) and the full contractual term. our computations of expected term for time-based options prior to fiscal year 2014 were based on data, such as the data of peer companies and company-specific attributes, which we believe could affect employees' exercise behavior. the expected life of market-based stock options valued using monte carlo simulation techniques is based upon the vesting dates forecasted by the simulation and assumes that options which vest, and for which the market condition has been satisfied, are exercised at the midpoint between the forecasted vesting date and their expiration.
we grant rsus, which are equity awards that are granted with an exercise price equal to zero and represent the right to receive one of our ordinary shares per rsu immediately upon vesting. we recognize compensation expense for rsus using the straight-line amortization method based on the fair value of rsus on the date of grant. in fiscal year 2014, the fair value of rsus is the closing market price of our ordinary shares on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. prior to fiscal year 2014, the fair value of rsus is the closing market price of our ordinary shares on the date of grant.
we also record share-based compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of rights to purchase ordinary shares under the espp and recognize this share-based compensation expense using the straight-line amortization method.
employee bonus programs. our employee bonus programs, which are overseen by our compensation committee, provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual targets and functional performance metrics. in the first fiscal quarter of the year, if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achieved and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, a variable, proportional compensation accrual is recorded based on an assumed 100% achievement of the targets and metrics. the bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than 100% and a portion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved. in subsequent quarters, we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics. the actual achievement of target metrics at the end of the fiscal year, which is subject to approval by our compensation committee, may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters, which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter.
fiscal year presentation we operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year which ends on the sunday closest to october 31. fiscal year 2013 consisted of 53 weeks, with the extra week falling in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. each of fiscal years 2014 and 2012 consisted of 52 weeks.

net revenue.  net revenue was $4,269 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to $2,520 million for fiscal year 2013, an increase of $1,749 million or 69%. the increase in net revenue was primarily due to revenue contribution from the acquired lsi and plx businesses and strength in the wireless communications and wired infrastructure segments. net revenue for fiscal year 2014 included $160 million of revenue from development arrangements and sales and licensing of ip compared to $87 million for fiscal year 2013.
historically, a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. during fiscal year 2014, foxconn accounted for 20% of our net revenue. our top ten customers for fiscal year 2014, which included three distributors, collectively accounted for 57% of our net revenue. we believe our aggregate sales to apple inc., when our direct sales to it are combined with indirect sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues, for both fiscal years 2014 and 2013. we believe our aggregate sales to cisco systems, inc., when our direct
sales to it are combined with indirect sales to the contract manufacturers that it utilizes, accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues, for fiscal year 2013. we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. the loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top ten customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
gross margin.  gross margin was $1,877 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to $1,198 million for fiscal year 2013, an increase of $679 million. as a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was 44% for fiscal year 2014, compared to 48% for fiscal year 2013. the increase in gross margin dollars for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to gross margin contributions from the enterprise storage segment and application specific integrated circuits, or asics, added as a result of the lsi acquisition, an increase in net revenue from, and improved product mix in, our wireless communications segment, as well as additional gross margin contributions from cyoptics, which we acquired during the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to the charges associated with the inventory step-up to fair value, large increases in amortization of intangible assets and restructuring expenses primarily related to the lsi acquisition, partially offset by improved gross margins in our wireless communications segment due to improved utilization of our internal manufacturing fabrication facility and favorable product mix.
research and development.  research and development expense was $695 million for fiscal year 2014, compared to $398 million for fiscal year 2013, an increase of $297 million or 75%. as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expense remained flat at 16% for fiscal year 2014, compared to fiscal year 2013. the majority of this increase, in absolute dollars, is related to the lsi acquisition completed at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, as well as a $50 million increase in compensation related expenses, including those associated with annual merit-based salary increases, additional headcount costs, accrued incentive compensation expense related to our employee bonus program, share-based compensation expense attributable to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values, and retention compensation expense primarily related to employees acquired in the cyoptics transaction. the overall dollar increase was also attributable to a $21 million increase in project expenses, mainly attributable to increases in depreciation expense related to capital expenditures supporting research and development efforts and computer software expenses. we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future, due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop.
selling, general and administrative.  selling, general and administrative expense was $407 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to $222 million for fiscal year 2013, an increase of $185 million or 83%. as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expense increased slightly to 10% for fiscal year 2014 compared to 9% for fiscal year 2013. the increase in selling, general and administrative expense was primarily due to the lsi acquisition. other changes in components of selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2014, compared to fiscal year 2013, consisted primarily of a $56 million increase in compensation related expenses, including share-based compensation attributable to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values, retention compensation expense primarily related to the cyoptics transaction, accrued incentive compensation expense related to our employee bonus program, annual merit-based salary increases and a $21 million increase in professional service fees, primarily related to the lsi transaction.
amortization of intangible assets.  total amortization expense of intangible assets was $446 million and $85 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2014 and 2013, an increase of $361 million. the increase in amortization expense for fiscal year 2014 was primarily attributable to the increase in amortizable intangible assets from the lsi, cyoptics and plx acquisitions. we anticipate our amortization expense will be substantially higher in future periods, primarily as a result of significant increases in amortizable intangible assets from these recent acquisitions.
restructuring charges.  we incurred total restructuring charges of $162 million for fiscal year 2014, which included $22 million and $140 million in cost of products sold and in operating expenses, respectively, compared to $3 million for fiscal year 2013, which included $1 million and $2 million in cost of products sold and in operating expenses, respectively. the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal year 2014 were due primarily to employee termination costs following the lsi acquisition. we expect to incur additional restructuring charges in future periods as a result of further integration and alignment of the completed lsi, plx and cyoptics acquisitions and acquisitions that we may make in the future.
interest expense.  interest expense was $110 million for fiscal year 2014, compared to $2 million for fiscal year 2013. this $108 million increase in interest expense was due to interest on our outstanding term loans, the convertible notes, and fees related to our 2014 revolving credit facility, together with the amortization of related debt issuance costs and accretion of the debt discount on the convertible notes. starting in fiscal year 2015, we expect to incur significantly higher aggregate interest expense due to the full annual effect of the borrowings we incurred to acquire lsi and commitment fees associated with the 2014 revolving credit facility. the related debt issuance costs will be charged to interest expense using the effective interest method over the respective borrowing terms. the commitment fees related to the 2014 revolving credit facility will be charged to interest expense over the commitment term.
other income, net.  other income, net was $14 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to other income, net of $19 million for fiscal year 2013. other income, net for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 is primarily attributable to realized gains on sales of investments.
provision for income taxes.  we recorded a provision for income taxes of $33 million for fiscal year 2014 compared to $16 million for fiscal year 2013. the provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2014 increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of income.

wireless communications. net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased 39% in fiscal year 2014 compared with the prior year due to continued strength in worldwide mobile smartphone sales, an increase in the amount of our product content in those phones and the start of 4g/long-term evolution, or lte, adoption in china. the increase in our product content within new smartphone models was driven by increased adoption of our film bulk acoustic resonator, or fbar, technology products.
income from operations from our wireless communications segment was 39% of segment revenue. this was an increase of 95%, compared with fiscal year 2013, primarily due to higher revenue and proportionately lower manufacturing costs due to higher fabrication utilization.
wired infrastructure. net revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased 55% in fiscal year 2014, compared with fiscal year 2013. the increase was primarily due to revenue contribution from the asics acquired from lsi and a full year of contributions from cyoptics, which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013.
income from operations from our wired infrastructure segment was 25% of segment revenue. this was an increase of 79% compared with fiscal year 2013, primarily due to revenue increases that outpaced growth in research and development spending.
enterprise storage. net revenue and income from operations from our enterprise storage segment, which was 34% of segment revenue, resulted from our acquisition of lsi in may 2014.
industrial & other. net revenue from our industrial & other segment increased slightly in fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of ip licensing revenue related to lsi within the industrial & other segment.
income from operations from our industrial & other segment was 44% of segment revenue and increased slightly compared with fiscal year 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of ip licensing revenue generated from ip acquired from lsi within the industrial & other segment.
unallocated expenses. unallocated expenses include amortization of intangible assets primarily due to our acquisitions, share-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, including charges related to inventory step-up to fair value, and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. unallocated expenses increased 456% compared with fiscal year 2013, primarily due to higher operating expenses related to increases in amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, and restructuring charges incurred in connection with our acquisitions of lsi and plx. additionally, share-based compensation expense increased in fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013 due to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and grants made to employees assumed in the acquisitions.

net revenue.  net revenue was $2,520 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to $2,364 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $156 million or 7%. the increase in net revenue was primarily due to strength in the wireless communications and wired infrastructure segments and the continued revenue contribution from the cyoptics acquisition, partially offset by the transition from developing, manufacturing and selling our legacy consumer and computing peripherals products to licensing ip relevant to these products in our industrial & other segment. further, fiscal year 2013 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal year 2012.
in fiscal year 2013, strength in the smartphone market, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year, and strong sales to our two largest smartphone oems, as well as 4g/lte product launches by other oems in our wireless communications segment contributed to the revenue increase from this market. however, this increase was partially offset by a significant decrease in net revenue from our industrial & other segment, primarily as a result of our transition from developing, manufacturing and selling consumer and computing peripherals products to licensing ip relevant to these products.
gross margin.  gross margin was $1,198 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to $1,142 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $56 million. as a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was flat at 48% for fiscal years 2013 and 2012. the increase in gross margin, in absolute dollars, in fiscal year 2013 was driven by increased sales, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from sales and licensing of ip of $25 million. in addition, during fiscal year 2013 less favorable product mix, with a higher proportion of sales into our wireless communications segment, and the effects of lower margin cyoptics-related revenue, also impacted gross margin compared to fiscal year 2012.
research and development.  research and development expense was $398 million for fiscal year 2013, compared to $335 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $63 million or 19%. as a percentage of net revenue, research and development expense was 16% for fiscal year 2013, compared to 14% for fiscal year 2012. the majority of this increase, in absolute dollars, resulted from investments in our wired infrastructure and wireless communications solutions. part of the increase was attributable to a $12 million increase in research and development project consumables and services. the overall dollar increase in research and development expense was also attributable to a $16 million increase in accrued incentive compensation expense
related to our employee bonus program, which is a variable expense related to our achievement of program performance metrics, and annual merit-based salary increases, a $15 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, due to annual merit-based salary increases and additional headcount costs from the cyoptics acquisition, a $10 million increase in share-based compensation expense attributable to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values, a $2 million increase in retention compensation expense primarily related to cyoptics acquisition, a $3 million increase in computer software expenses and a $2 million increase in depreciation expense related to capital expenditures supporting research and development efforts. these increases were partially offset by a $2 million decrease in accrued reimbursements pursuant to research and development grants in fiscal year 2013, compared to fiscal year 2012. we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future, due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop.
selling, general and administrative.  selling, general and administrative expense was $222 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to $199 million for fiscal year 2012, an increase of $23 million or 12%. as a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expense increased slightly to 9% for fiscal year 2013 compared to 8% for fiscal year 2012. changes in components of selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012, consisted primarily of a $10 million increase in share-based compensation attributable to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values, a $9 million increase in accrued incentive compensation expense related to our employee bonus program, and a $5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense related primarily to annual merit-based salary increases, partially offset by decreased overhead expenses.
amortization of intangible assets.  total amortization expense of intangible assets was $85 million and $77 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2013 and 2012.
restructuring charges.  we incurred total restructuring charges of $3 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to $7 million for fiscal year 2012, both predominantly representing employee termination costs.
interest expense.  interest expense was $2 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to $1 million for fiscal year 2012. this $1 million increase was due to commitment fees related to our 2011 revolving credit facility and amortization of related deferred debt issuance costs.
other income, net.  other income, net includes net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sales securities, realized and unrealized gains on trading securities, gains on the sale of cost method investments, interest income, gains (losses) on currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items. other income, net was $19 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to other income, net of $4 million for fiscal year 2012. this increase in other income, net for fiscal year 2013 is primarily attributable to realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale and trading securities and unrealized gains on trading securities. interest income was $4 million for each of fiscal years 2013 and 2012.
provision for income taxes.  we recorded an income tax provision of $16 million for fiscal year 2013 compared to an income tax provision of $22 million for fiscal year 2012. the provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2013 decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a benefit of $3 million from the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, which was signed into law on january 2, 2013, retroactively extending the u.s. federal research and development tax credit from january 1, 2012 to december 31, 2013, and a benefit of $2 million from the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain audit periods.
segment results in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, our three segments were wireless communications, wired infrastructure and industrial & other. net revenue and income from operations by segment were as follows:

wireless communications. net revenue from our wireless communications segment increased in fiscal year 2013 compared with the prior year due to continued strength in mobile smartphone sales. unit sales of smartphones containing our products, as well as the amount of our product content in those phones, is a key driver of our revenue from this segment. new 4g/lte product ramps at major smartphone oems and handset launches at other oems, as well as improvements in our content in those phones, also drove revenue growth during fiscal year 2013. as a result, we experienced higher demand for our power amplifiers and our fbar duplexers in fiscal year 2013.
income from operations from our wireless communications segment increased in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012, primarily as a result of the increase in revenue.
wired infrastructure. net revenue from our wired infrastructure segment increased in fiscal year 2013, compared with fiscal year 2012 primarily due to revenues resulting from cyoptics, which we acquired in june 2013, and improvement in datacenter demand. this was partially offset by weak carrier routing spending in fiscal year 2013.
income from operations from our wired infrastructure segment decreased in fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 primarily as a result of lower gross margin rates related to product mix, together with increased research and development expense primarily due to the cyoptics acquisition, partially offset by the impact of higher revenue.
industrial & other. net revenue from our industrial & other segment decreased in fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 primarily due to our transition from developing, manufacturing and selling our consumer and computing peripherals products to licensing ip relevant to these products. this decrease was partially offset by improved demand from our industrial distributors and oems, notably in transportation and power generation, in fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012. however, demand in asia tapered off towards the end of fiscal year 2013. in fiscal year 2013, we generated approximately $19 million compared to $31 million in fiscal year 2012 of ip sales and licensing royalty revenue. due to the structure of these licensing arrangements, royalty revenue may fluctuate from period to period.
income from operations from our industrial & other segment decreased in fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012, primarily due to a decrease in sales of ip in fiscal year 2013.
unallocated expenses. unallocated expenses increased in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012. this increase was primarily attributable to increases in share-based compensation expense related to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant-date fair values and acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with our cyoptics acquisition.
liquidity and capital resources the following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our principal liquidity requirements and sources and uses of cash. our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible.
our primary sources of liquidity at november 2, 2014 consisted of: (1) approximately $1,604 million in cash and cash equivalents, (2) cash we expect to generate from operations and (3) our $500 million 2014 revolving credit facility, which is committed until may 6, 2019, all of which is available to be drawn. our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) interest, principal and commitment fees payments related to borrowings incurred to fund the acquisition of lsi, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, (v) quarterly dividend payments (if and when declared by our board of directors, or our board), and (vi) funding employee benefit plan obligations. our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows, which are determined by future operating performance and are, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.
pension plans assumed in the lsi acquisition as a result of the lsi acquisition, we assumed pension plans under which we are obligated to make future contributions to fund benefits to participants. the plans provide retirement benefits to certain former u.s. employees of lsi under defined benefit pension plans. the projected benefit obligations under these pension plans exceeded the value of the assets of those plans by approximately $440 million at november 2, 2014. our minimum required funding contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2015 is at least $62 million. we expect to have additional funding requirements with respect to the plans in future years. we may also choose to make additional, voluntary contributions to the plans. in connection with the lsi acquisition, we also entered into an agreement with the pension benefit guaranty corporation pursuant to which we have agreed to make contributions in excess of the minimum required contributions ranging from $11 million to $31 million in each of our fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, if we do not meet specified financial ratios. depending on our cash position at the time, any such contributions to our pension plans could impact our liquidity and financial position.
share repurchases during fiscal year 2013 the company repurchased and retired 0.7 million shares for $24 million under the 2012 share repurchase program, which expired on april 9, 2013, and repurchased and retired 1.9 million shares for $71 million under the 2013 share repurchase program. during fiscal year 2014, the company repurchased and retired 0.3 million shares for $12 million under the 2013 share repurchase program, which expired on april 8, 2014.
share repurchases under our share repurchase programs were made in the open market at such times and in such amounts as the company deemed appropriate. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depended on a variety of factors including price, market conditions and applicable legal requirements.
on april 9, 2014, at the 2014 annual general meeting of shareholders, or agm, our shareholders authorized our board to approve a share repurchase program to purchase up to approximately 25 million of its ordinary shares in open market transactions or equal access schemes, or the 2014 share purchase mandate. the 2014 share purchase mandate will expire upon the earlier of the date of our 2015 agm or the date by which the 2015 agm is required by law to be held, unless such period is extended, varied or revoked by our shareholders at a general meeting. our board has not authorized the company to repurchase shares under the 2014 share purchase mandate.
summary our cash and cash equivalents increased by $619 million to $1,604 million at november 2, 2014 from $985 million at november 3, 2013, primarily due to $4.6 billion from the term loans under the 2014 credit agreement, $1.0 billion from the convertible notes, $1,175 million in cash provided by operating activities, $450 million from the sale of the flash business, and $124 million from the issuance of ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of options and purchase rights under our employee share purchase plan. partially offsetting the increase in cash and cash equivalents was $5,961 million paid for business acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2014, $409 million in cash paid for capital expenditures, $284 million of
dividends paid to our shareholders and $124 million of debt issuance costs related to the term loans under the 2014 credit agreement and 2014 revolving credit facility.
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and cash flows from operations, combined with current borrowing availability under our 2014 revolving credit facility and $650 million from the sale of the axxia business, completed on november 18, 2014, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, including the current portions of our long-term debt and interest due, the tender or conversion of outstanding convertible notes for settlement in cash, annual cash contributions to fund assumed lsi pension and retirement plan obligations, projected working capital requirements, capital expenditures, quarterly cash dividends (if and when declared by our board) and any share repurchases (if authorized by our board) that we may choose to make for at least the next 12 months. we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand to operate our business and satisfy our current obligations.
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for fiscal year 2015 will be higher than for fiscal year 2014, due primarily to continued spending related to ongoing capacity expansion in our fort collins internal fabrication facility, as well as spending on equipment to support various research and development projects and expenditures related to lsi campus rationalization.
from time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies and product lines, such as our recent acquisitions of lsi and plx. any such transaction could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to arrange for new debt and equity financing to fund the transaction. if we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or to finance growth opportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and financial condition could suffer. we could also reduce certain expenditures such as payment of our quarterly cash dividend. in such circumstances we may seek also to obtain debt or equity financing. however, we cannot assure that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. our ability to service any indebtedness we may incur, including under our 2014 credit agreement, 2014 revolving credit facility and the outstanding convertible notes, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.
we may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities or increase our aggregate term loans and revolving credit commitments capacity to $6.7 billion as allowed under the 2014 credit agreement, or increase our 2014 revolving credit facility for reasons other than those specified above.
the aggregate consideration for the acquisition of lsi was approximately $6.5 billion. in connection with the merger agreement for that transaction, we also issued to two entities affiliated with silver lake partners, or the purchasers, $1 billion aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes. the initial conversion rate for the convertible notes was 20.8160 shares of avago's ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $48.04 per ordinary share. we funded the balance of the acquisition consideration from $4.6 billion in term loans under the 2014 credit agreement and cash on hand of the combined companies.

convertible senior notes in connection with the acquisition of lsi on may 6, 2014, the company completed the private placement of $1 billion of our convertible notes to the purchasers pursuant to the terms of the note purchase agreement among the company, silver lake partners iv, l.p. (whose rights and obligations under the note purchase agreement were thereafter assigned to and assumed by the purchasers), and deutsche bank ag, singapore branch, as lead manager. all of the net proceeds from the convertible notes were used to fund the lsi acquisition.
the convertible notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated may 6, 2014, between the company and u.s. bank national association, as trustee, or the indenture. the indenture includes customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default after which the convertible notes may be due and payable immediately. the convertible notes are the company's unsecured senior obligations. the convertible notes will mature on august 15, 2021, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. the convertible notes will pay interest semi-annually at a rate of 2% per year, payable in arrears on may 1 and november 1 of each year, beginning on november 1, 2014, and on the maturity date. subject to any limitations set forth in the indenture, the convertible notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. upon conversion, the convertible notes may be settled in the company's ordinary shares, cash or a combination of cash and ordinary shares, at the company's option. the convertible notes were convertible at an initial conversion rate of 20.8160 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of the convertible notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $48.04 per ordinary share, and is subject to adjustment under the terms of the convertible notes, including adjustments for quarterly cash dividends paid on the company's ordinary shares to the extent they exceed $0.27 per share. holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require the company to repurchase all or some of their convertible notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture. in addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the indenture, avago may be required to increase the conversion rate for the convertible notes converted in connection with such a make-whole fundamental change. prior to may 6, 2019, the company may not redeem the convertible notes. beginning on may 6, 2019, the company may, at its option, redeem the convertible notes, in whole or in part, if the closing sale price, as defined in the indenture, of the ordinary shares for 20 or more trading days, as defined in the indenture, in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date on which the company provides notice of such redemption exceeds 150% of the applicable conversion price in effect on each such trading day, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of notes being redeemed, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, as defined in the indenture.

at november 2, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants described in the indenture.
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and timing of payments. as a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of november 2, 2014 for the fiscal periods noted (in millions):
purchase commitments(2)                     $638              $616               $20                       $2              $-
other contractual commitments(3)            $193               $56               $82                      $55              $-
pension plan contributions(5)                $62               $62                $-          *            $-          *   $-                *
*   we have pension plans covering certain u.s. and non-u.s. employees. although additional future contributions will be required, the amount and timing of these contributions will be affected by actuarial assumptions, the actual rate of return on plan assets, the level of market interest rates, legislative changes and the amount of voluntary contributions to the plans. the amount shown in the table represents our planned contributions to our pension plans within a year. because any contributions for fiscal year 2016 and later will depend on the value of the plan assets in the future and thus are uncertain, we have not included any amounts for fiscal year 2016 and beyond in the above table. see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in item 8.
(1)   represents principal, interest and commitment fees payable on borrowings and credit facilities under the 2014 credit agreement and principal and interest payable on the convertible notes.
(2)   represents unconditional purchase obligations which include agreements to purchase goods or services, primarily inventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.

item 1a. risk factors we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations. our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. while we describe each risk separately, some of these risks are interrelated and certain risks could trigger the applicability of other risks described below.
our business and financial results are highly sensitive to sales volume. a number of economic and market conditions drive changes in vehicle sales, including real estate values, levels of unemployment, the availability of credit, fluctuations in the cost of fuel, consumer confidence and global economic conditions. we cannot predict future economic and market conditions with certainty.
our ability to maintain profitability over the long-term is dependent upon our ability to introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers.
the automotive industry, particularly in the u.s., is very competitive with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet consumer expectations, and in the past our competitors have been very successful in persuading customers that previously purchased our products to purchase their vehicles instead. producing new and improved vehicle models on a basis competitive with the models introduced by our competitors and preserving our reputation for designing, building and selling safe and high quality cars that meet customer preferences is critical to our long-term profitability. we will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2015. a successful launch of our new vehicles is critical to our short-term profitability.
the pace of our development and introduction of new and improved vehicles depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design, engineering and manufacturing, which requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit new talent. in some cases the technologies that we plan to employ, such as hydrogen fuel cells and advanced battery technology, are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advances by us and by our suppliers. there can be no assurance that our competitors and others pursuing similar technologies and other competing technologies will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do or on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage.
our profitability is dependent upon the success of our higher margin vehicles and luxury brands.
while we offer a balanced and complete portfolio of small, mid-size and large cars, cross-overs, sport utility vehicles (suvs) and trucks, we generally recognize higher profit margins on our full-size pick-up trucks and suvs. our success is dependent upon consumer preferences and our ability to market our higher margin vehicles.
general motors company and subsidiaries our future competitiveness and ability to achieve long-term profitability depends on our ability to control our costs, which requires us to successfully implement restructuring initiatives throughout our automotive operations.
we are continuing to implement a number of cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives in our automotive operations, including labor modifications and substantial restructuring initiatives. our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiatives throughout our automotive operations. while some of the elements of cost reduction are within our control, others, such as interest rates or return on investments, which influence our expense for pensions, depend more on external factors, and there can be no assurance that such external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our costs. reducing costs may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering expenses necessary to improve the performance, safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicles are likely to increase.
our automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. our use of "just-in-time" manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts. as a result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules. in some instances we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. where we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules or suspend production entirely.
we use various raw materials in our business including steel, aluminum, copper, platinum and palladium. the prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. in recent years freight charges and raw material costs increased. substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials could reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased vehicle prices. some of these raw materials, such as corrosion-resistant steel, are only available from a limited number of suppliers. we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers. an increase in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials, which may be caused by a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers or by events such as labor strikes, could negatively affect our net revenues and profitability to a material extent.
we operate in a highly competitive industry that has excess manufacturing capacity and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results.
the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry exceeds demand. many manufacturers have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as significant limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs. our competitors may respond to these relatively high fixed costs by attempting to sell more vehicles by adding vehicle enhancements, providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. manufacturers in lower cost countries such as china and india have emerged as competitors in key emerging markets and announced their intention of exporting their products to established markets as a bargain alternative to entry-level automobiles. these actions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results, and present a significant risk to our ability to enhance our revenue per vehicle.
our competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by industry consolidation or alliances.
designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in manufacturing, machinery, research and development, product design, engineering, technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and regulatory requirements. large original equipment manufacturers are able to benefit from economies of scale by leveraging their investments and activities on a global basis across brands and nameplates. if our competitors consolidate or enter into other strategic agreements such as alliances, they may be able to take better advantage of these economies of scale to enhance their competitiveness or liquidity position.
general motors company and subsidiaries we face difficult market and operating conditions in certain parts of the world that may require us to restructure, impair or rationalize these operations. in many countries across our regions we have experienced challenges in our operations and continue to strategically assess the manner in which we operate in certain countries. as we continue to assess our performance throughout the regions, additional restructuring, impairment and rationalization actions may be required and may be material. the key areas of our plan include: (1) investments in our product portfolio; (2) a revised brand strategy; and (3) reducing material, development and production costs. the success of our plan will depend on a combination of our ability to execute the actions contemplated, as well as external economic factors, which are outside of our control.
we could be materially adversely affected by a negative outcome in unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or other legal proceedings related to the ignition switch recall.
we are subject to legal proceedings involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, stockholder litigation and governmental investigations, including class actions related to the ignition switch recall, such as a lawsuit for the alleged diminished value of vehicles affected by the ignition switch recall. refer to the "gm north america" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations (md&a) for additional information on the ignition switch recall. at this point we are unable to predict the duration, scope, developments in, results of or consequences of the government's investigations. such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of damages, substantial fines, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as significant legal and other costs. because the matters are ongoing there can be no assurance as to how the resulting consequences, if any, may impact our business, reputation, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. we cannot currently estimate the potential liability, damages or range of potential loss as a result of the legal proceedings and governmental investigations. for a further discussion of these matters refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.
from time to time we recall our products to address performance, compliance or safety-related issues. the costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. in addition product recalls can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers, particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of our products. conversely not issuing a recall or not issuing a recall on a timely basis can harm our reputation and cause us to lose customers for the same reasons as expressed above.
we are affected significantly by governmental regulations that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio. we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulations, and the related costs and changes to our product lineup, will increase significantly in the future. these government regulatory requirements could significantly affect our plans for global product development and may result in substantial costs, including civil or criminal penalties. they may also result in limits on the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect revenue.
in the u.s. automotive safety standards are regulated by the nhtsa, whose regulators require that automotive manufacturers implement safety measures such as recalls for vehicles that do not or may not comply with relevant safety standards. due to these regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs including significant costs for free repairs, if we are required to, or voluntarily decide to, implement safety measures such as a recall. for example, we are currently facing u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york, congressional, sec, transport canada and state investigations related to the ignition switch recall.
we are committed to meeting or exceeding these u.s. regulatory requirements. we expect that to comply with these requirements we will be required to sell a significant volume of hybrid electric vehicles, as well as implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all at increased cost levels. there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with these regulatory programs.
general motors company and subsidiaries if we are not able to comply with specific new requirements then we could be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance. environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial. violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, possible fines or a combination of any of those items. we must also cover the cost of repairs conducted under emission defect and performance warranties which apply for specified periods of time and mileage. in turn any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.
our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates, changes in assumptions and investments that do not achieve adequate returns.
our employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. a detailed description of the investment funds and strategies is disclosed in the "critical accounting estimates" section of the md&a and note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.
there are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.
our future funding requirements for our u.s. defined benefit pension plans qualified with the internal revenue service (irs) depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in government laws and regulations. future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, as other factors are held constant. our potential funding requirements are described in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.
factors which affect future funding requirements for our u.s. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-u.s. plans. certain plans outside the u.s. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our non-u.s. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds.
shortages of and volatility in the price of oil may cause shifts in consumer vehicle demand.
volatile oil prices in recent years have tended to cause a shift in consumer demand towards smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, which provide lower profit margins. any increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of political instability in the middle east, south america and african nations, could weaken the demand for our higher margin full-size pick-up trucks and suvs, which could decrease. lower oil prices in oil producing countries could also impact our ability to sell vehicles in those countries.
we rely on gm financial to provide financial services to our dealers and customers in a majority of the markets in which we sell vehicles. gm financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations and its ability to provide leasing and financing to consumers and commercial lending to our dealers to support additional sales of our vehicles.
we rely on gm financial in north america, europe, south america and china to support leasing and sales of our vehicles to consumers requiring vehicle financing and also to provide commercial lending to our dealers. any reduction of gm financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among consumers and dealers. the factors that could adversely affect gm financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include:
•   the availability of borrowings under its credit facilities to fund its consumer and dealer finance activities;
•   its ability to access a variety of financing sources including the asset-backed securities market and other secured and unsecured debt markets;
•   the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by delinquencies, defaults or prepayments;
we intend to invest significant capital resources to support our products and to develop new technology. in addition we plan to invest heavily in alternative fuel and advanced propulsion technologies in 2015, largely to support our planned expansion of hybrid and electric vehicles. however if our future operations do not provide us with the cash flow we anticipate, we may be forced to reduce, delay or cancel our planned investments in new technology.
security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information.
we rely upon information technology networks and systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain management, manufacturing, invoicing and collection of payments from our dealer network and from customers of gm financial. additionally we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, propriety business information of our dealers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. the secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. despite security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems or computer viruses. the occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. we have been the target of these types of attacks in the past with no material known impacts and future attacks are likely to occur. if successful, these types of attacks on our network or systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices, or service failures could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. in addition any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations and reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to significant security attacks or disruptions resulting from such attacks.
a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that we cannot operate solely for our benefit.
many of our operations, primarily in china, are carried out by joint ventures such as shanghai general motors co., ltd. in joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions. in joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes or relationships deteriorate, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, so that we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures.
general motors company and subsidiaries our business in china is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions.
maintaining a strong position in the chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. the automotive market in china is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. as the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share. increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. in addition our business in china is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive sales volume in china.
given the nature of the automotive industry and global spread of our business, we have significant exposures to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. in preparing the consolidated financial statements we translate our revenues and expenses outside the u.s. into u.s. dollars using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the period and the assets and liabilities using the foreign currency exchange rate at the balance sheet date.
our businesses outside the u.s. expose us to additional risks.
the majority of our vehicles are sold outside the u.s. we are pursuing growth opportunities for our business in a variety of business environments outside the u.s. operating in a large number of different regions and countries exposes us to political, economic and other risks as well as multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change, including:
•   changes in foreign regulations impacting our overall business model restricting our ability to buy and sell our products in those countries, especially china;
•   impact of compliance with u.s. and other foreign countries' export controls and economic sanctions;
•   liabilities resulting from u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anti-corruption laws;
•   political and economic instability, natural calamities, war and terrorism.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation this md&a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
general motors company and subsidiaries management uses earnings before interest and taxes (ebit)-adjusted to review the operating results of our automotive segments because it excludes interest income, interest expense and income taxes and includes certain additional adjustments. gm financial uses income before income taxes-adjusted because management believes interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. examples of adjustments to ebit and gm financial's income before income taxes include certain impairment charges related to goodwill, other long-lived assets and investments; certain gains or losses on the settlement/extinguishment of obligations; and gains or losses on the sale of non-core investments. refer to note 25 to our consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measure under u.s. gaap.
management uses adjusted free cash flow to review the liquidity of our automotive operations. we measure adjusted free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions, primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet, such as accrued interest on prepayments of debt and voluntary contributions to employee benefit plans. refer to the "liquidity" section of md&a for our reconciliation of this non-gaap measure to the most directly comparable financial measure under u.s. gaap.
management uses these non-gaap measures in its financial and operational decision making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes as they provide additional transparency of our core operations. these measures allow management to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions.
our calculation of these non-gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. as a result the use of these non-gaap measures has limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related u.s. gaap measures.
overview our strategic plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will help us achieve 9% to 10% margins on an ebit-adjusted basis (ebit-adjusted margins, calculated as ebit-adjusted divided by net sales and revenue) by early next decade: (1) earn customers for life by developing a strong product pipeline, leading the industry in quality and safety and delivering on our commitments; (2) lead the industry in product design, with our light-weighting and mixed material body structures and in leading edge technology, including the launch of 4g lte in china and expansion of onstar to europe; (3) grow our brands, particularly the cadillac brand in the u.s. and china; (4) continue our growth in china; (5) continue our growth of gm financial as our captive automotive financing company; and (6) deliver core operating efficiencies by institutionalizing operational excellence. our financial targets include the following:
•   expected ebit-adjusted and ebit-adjusted margins improving in all automotive segments in 2015 due primarily to the following anticipated trends: (1) an approximately 3% increase in global industry vehicle sales; (2) improved mix of full-size suvs and full-size pick-up trucks; and (3) lower overall restructuring costs; partially offset by (4) higher marketing and engineering costs; and (5) unfavorable foreign currency effects;
•   forecasted consolidated ebit-adjusted margins of 9% to 10% by the 2020s;
•   expected ebit-adjusted margins of 10% in gmna in 2016, which we anticipate will be driven by product launches, disciplined pricing and a focus on fixed costs;
•   an anticipated return to profitability in gme in 2016 driven by investments in our product portfolio, a revised brand strategy and reducing material, development and production costs assuming europe does not suffer another recession;
•   continued strong net income margins at our china jvs, with plans to invest approximately $14 billion in china through 2018 and increase vehicle sales volumes by nearly 40% by 2018;
•   expected continued improvement of our core operations in gmsa through product launches and material and logistics optimization, with a long-term objective of single digit ebit-adjusted margins; and
•   an anticipated increase of gm financial's support of the sale of new gm vehicles around the world through a comprehensive suite of financing products, including continuing on the path towards full global captive capability.
automotive summary and outlook our consolidated net income decreased from $5.3 billion to $4.0 billion. notwithstanding this decrease we had strong financial results in 2014 excluding the impact of recall campaign and courtesy transportation charges. performance of gmna met our expectations, while gme and gmio outperformed our expectations. however, we experienced weaker performance in gmsa due to the challenging environment in venezuela, brazil and argentina.
in the three months ended june 30, 2014 we announced the creation of a compensation program (the program) to compensate accident victims who died or suffered physical injury (or their families) as a result of a faulty ignition switch related to the 2.6 million vehicles recalled under the ignition switch recall. refer to the "gm north america" section of md&a for additional information on the ignition switch recall. it is important to our company that we reach everyone through this program who has been impacted. the program is being administered by an independent program administrator. the independent administrator has established a protocol that defines the eligibility requirements to participate in the program. there is no cap on the amount of payments that can be made to claimants under the program.
in the three months ended june 30, 2014 we recorded $0.4 billion in automotive selling, general and administrative expense in corporate which represents our best estimate of amounts that may be paid under the program. the amount was treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes. however, it is reasonably possible that the liability could exceed our recorded amount by approximately $0.2 billion. the most significant estimates affecting the amount recorded include the number of participants that have eligible claims related to death and physical injury, which also contemplates the severity of injury, the length of hospital stays and related compensation amounts and the number of people who actually elect to participate in the program. our estimate is subject to significant uncertainties, as programs of this nature are highly unusual and each eligible claim will have a unique underlying fact pattern. while we do not anticipate material changes to our current estimate, it is possible that material changes could occur if actual eligible claims and the related compensation amounts differ from this estimate. the program accepted claims from august 1, 2014 through january 31, 2015. payments to eligible claimants began in the fourth quarter 2014 and will continue through the first half of 2015. accident victims (or their families) could choose not to participate in the program and pursue litigation against us. at january 30, 2015 the program has received 3,810 claims and the independent program administrator has determined 128 claims to be eligible for payment under the program. remaining claims are either under review, deficient awaiting further documentation or deemed ineligible. based on currently available information we believe our accrual at december 31, 2014 is adequate to cover the estimated costs under the program. at january 30, 2015 we have paid $93 million to eligible claimants under the program. accident victims that accept a payment under the program agree to settle all claims against gm related to the accident.
gmna automotive industry volume has continued to grow in north america. in 2014 u.s. industry light vehicle sales for the calendar year were 16.5 million units, up from 15.6 million units in 2013. in january 2015 we announced that we expect 2015 industry light vehicle sales to be between 16.5 and 17.0 million units.
customer safety and satisfaction were the major reasons for the recall of approximately 36 million vehicles announced during 2014. these recalls included: (1) approximately 2.6 million vehicles to repair ignition switches that could result in a loss of electrical power under certain circumstances that may prevent front airbags from deploying in the event of a crash (accident victims who died or suffered physical injury associated with these vehicles (or their families) may be eligible to participate in a compensation program, as more fully described in note 17 to our consolidated financial statements) and to fix ignition lock cylinders that could allow removal of the ignition key while the engine is running, leading to possible rollaway or crash; (2) approximately 1.9 million vehicles to replace either the power steering motor, the steering column, the power steering motor control unit or a combination of the steering column and the power steering motor control unit as the electric power steering could fail under certain circumstances; (3) approximately 1.3 million vehicles prone to non-deployment of the side impact restraints if vehicles are not serviced when the service air bag warning light is illuminated; (4) approximately 2.7 million vehicles to modify the brake lamp wiring harness that could have corrosion develop due to micro-vibration; (5) approximately 1.5 million vehicles to replace front safety lap belt cables that could fatigue and separate over time; (6) approximately 1.4 million vehicles to replace the shift cable that could wear out over time resulting in mismatches of the gear position indicated by the shift lever; (7) approximately 12.1 million vehicles to rework or replace ignition keys because the ignition switch may move out of the "run" position which may impact power steering and power braking and, depending on timing of the key movement relative to the activation of the sensing algorithm of a crash event, may result in airbags not deploying; (8) approximately 1.1 million vehicles to repair a loose battery cable that could impact vehicle warning systems; (9) approximately 0.7 million vehicles to repair ignition mechanisms where the ignition key could be pulled out while the vehicle is in the run position; (10) approximately 0.6 million vehicles to replace the wave plate in all vehicles with 6t70 and 6t75 transmissions which could crack under certain circumstances; and (11) approximately 10.1 million vehicles for other matters. in the three and six months ended june 30, 2014 we recorded charges of approximately $1.1 billion and $2.4 billion primarily for the estimated costs of parts and labor to repair these vehicles and for courtesy transportation. the cost of the vehicles recalled in the six months ended december 31, 2014 were comprehended in the june 30, 2014 catch-up adjustment of $0.9 billion associated with a change in estimate for previously sold vehicles. refer to note 1 and note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for more detail related to the catch-up adjustment. total net sales and revenue for gmna have increased for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to prior year by 6.4%. it is difficult to determine the impact, if any, on current or future net sales and revenue due to our recent recall activity. of the approximately 36 million vehicles subject to recall, approximately 63% of the vehicles and 65% of the costs involve vehicles we no longer produce or sell. we began repairing vehicles in early april 2014 and we have produced sufficient parts to have the ability to repair all vehicles impacted by the ignition switch recall. refer to the "gm north america" section of md&a for additional information on all of the recalls we announced in 2014.
in the year ending december 31, 2015 we expect an increase in ebit-adjusted and ebit-adjusted margins due primarily to: (1) a slight increase in u.s. industry vehicle sales; and (2) full year production of full-size suvs; partially offset by (3) increased engineering and marketing costs.
gme the automotive industry conditions in europe remain challenging due to economic uncertainty resulting from weak gross domestic growth, high unemployment and vehicle production overcapacity. despite such conditions, automotive industry sales to retail and fleet customers began to improve in the three months ended december 31, 2013 compared to the corresponding period in 2012. this trend continued in 2014 with industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 19 million vehicles representing a 1.8% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2013.
our european operations are benefiting from this trend and continue to show signs of improvement underscored by further improvement in our opel and vauxhall market share in the year ended december 31, 2014, which builds on our first market share increase in 14 years in 2013. this market share increase was partially driven by the success of the recently launched opel mokka.
we continue to implement various strategic actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness. the key actions include investments in our product portfolio including the next generation opel astra and corsa, a revised brand strategy
general motors company and subsidiaries and reducing material, development and production costs, including restructuring activities. the success of these actions will depend on a combination of our ability to execute and external factors which are outside of our control.
we continue to assess additional strategic actions across the region as a result of significant volume pricing and foreign exchange pressures in certain markets, which may result in additional restructuring or rationalization actions. these actions, if implemented, may result in impairment and other charges. the determination of the amount of these charges is subject to significant uncertainty and highly dependent on finalization of our strategic assessments.
our restructuring activities include our effort to rationalize our manufacturing footprint in gme whereby we reached agreement with the labor union in germany to terminate all vehicle and transmission production at our bochum, germany facility at the end of 2014. affected employees are eligible for a voluntary restructuring separation program. restructuring charges were recorded primarily through the end of 2014. refer to note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in the year ended december 31, 2014 we performed a strategic assessment of our russian operations as a result of a significant deterioration in sales volumes due to challenging market conditions and deterioration in the russian ruble. our review indicated that the existing long-lived assets and certain investments in our russian operations were not recoverable. as a result we recorded impairment charges of $0.2 billion in automotive cost of sales which was treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes. industry and economic conditions in russia remain volatile and we continue to evaluate and execute various strategic actions to improve our operations in a difficult environment.
we expect the european automotive industry to continue to moderately improve and we expect to be profitable in gme in 2016.
in the year ending december 31, 2015 we expect an increase in ebit-adjusted and ebit-adjusted margins due primarily to: (1) lower restructuring costs; partially offset by (2) higher engineering, marketing and depreciation and amortization cost.
gmio we are addressing many of the challenges in our gmio operations and continue to strategically assess the manner in which we operate in certain countries within gmio. in 2013 we announced the withdrawal of the chevrolet brand from western and central europe and the ceasing of manufacturing and significant reduction of engineering operations in australia by 2017 and incurred impairment and other charges in 2013 and 2014. we continue to execute these plans and within the financial impact that we projected. as we continue to assess our performance throughout the region, additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may be material.
in the three months ended december 31, 2014 due to a significant decrease in domestic sales driven by political unrest and a lack of consumer confidence domestically as well as ongoing weakness and trade challenges in several export markets we performed a recoverability test of our real and personal property assets in our thailand operations. as a result we recorded impairment charges of $0.2 billion in automotive cost of sales which was treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes.
to address the significant industry, market share, pricing and foreign exchange pressures in the region, we continue to focus on product portfolio enhancements, manufacturing footprint rationalization, increased local sourcing of parts, cost structure reductions, as well as brand and dealer network improvements which we expect to favorably impact the region over the medium term. however, with the significant reduction in wholesale volumes and forward pricing pressures, we tested certain long-lived assets for impairment and additional testing may occur in the near term. determining whether long-lived assets need to be tested for impairment, whether recorded amounts are recoverable and the estimate of impairment and other charges, if any, is subject to significant uncertainty and highly dependent on finalization of our strategic assessments.
in the year ending december 31, 2015 we expect an increase in ebit-adjusted and ebit-adjusted margins due primarily to: (1) improved profitability at our china jvs; (2) a flat to slight increase in industry vehicle sales; (3) improved product mix in the middle east; and (4) improved cost performance; partially offset by (5) higher restructuring costs.
in china we are expecting an increase in industry vehicle sales with a modest increase in market share coupled with new vehicle launches and a full year of the 2014 launches.
general motors company and subsidiaries in the three months ended march 31, 2014 we recorded devaluation charges of $0.4 billion related to a change in the exchange rate we use for remeasuring our venezuelan subsidiaries' non-u.s. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the venezuela official exchange rate to the rate determined by an auction process conducted by venezuela's complementary system of foreign currency administration (sicad i). in addition to currency controls already in place the venezuelan government announced pricing controls that, taken with other initiatives, require us to closely monitor and consider our ability to maintain a controlling financial interest in our venezuelan subsidiaries. refer to the "gm south america" section of md&a for additional information.

recall campaigns in the year ended december 31, 2014 we experienced a significant increase in the number of vehicles subject to recall in north america resulting in incremental charges for the estimated costs of parts and labor to repair these vehicles and courtesy transportation for certain recalls. there were approximately 36 million vehicles subject to recalls announced during this period. this included approximately 10 million vehicles subject to multiple recalls and reflects the results of our ongoing comprehensive safety review, additional engineering analysis and our overall commitment to customer satisfaction.
in the three months ended march 31, 2014 we announced a recall to repair ignition switches in vehicles that we are no longer producing that under certain circumstances could result in a loss of electrical power that may prevent front airbags from deploying in the event of a crash. it was originally estimated that approximately 800,000 vehicles were equipped with ignition switches needing repair. these vehicles include model years 2005-2007 chevrolet cobalt, 2007 pontiac g5 and 2005-2006 pursuit. in the three months ended december 31, 2013 we recorded approximately $40 million in automotive cost of sales to cover the repairs as these costs were considered probable and estimable at that time. in the three months ended march 31, 2014 we expanded this recall by approximately 1.8 million additional vehicles for the same issue. these vehicles, consisting of model years 2008-2010 chevrolet cobalt, model years 2006-2011 hhr, model years 2008-2010 pontiac g5, model years 2006-2010 solstice, model years 2003-2007 saturn ion and model years 2007-2010 sky, were not included in the initial recall. in the three months ended march 31, 2014 we recorded approximately $90 million in automotive cost of sales to repair these vehicles and approximately $270 million in automotive cost of sales to provide courtesy transportation to owners of affected vehicles. these recalls, relating to ignition switches, are collectively referred to as the "ignition switch recall." refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for litigation associated with the ignition switch recall. a second repair was added to these vehicles as a result of the comprehensive review described below to fix ignition lock cylinders that could allow removal of the ignition key while the engine is running, leading to possible rollaway or crash. in the three months ended march 31, 2014 we recorded approximately $320 million in automotive cost of sales to repair ignition lock cylinders.
in response to these developments we conducted an in-depth review of the ignition switch recall and our overall recall processes. we hired a former u.s. attorney to conduct an internal investigation of the ignition switch recall and to provide recommendations to improve our recall processes. pursuant to the investigation a report was provided to us in the three months ended june 30, 2014. the investigation report made a series of recommendations in eight major areas. we intend to act or have acted on each of the recommendations. after reviewing the investigation report, we made a number of personnel decisions. fifteen individuals identified in the investigation report are no longer with the company. five additional individuals were disciplined. prior to the receipt of the
general motors company and subsidiaries investigation report we began the process of adding over 100 new safety investigators and related specialists in north america alone allowing us to bolster capacity and capability in identifying potential emerging issues and conducting product investigations, launched a speak up for safety program encouraging employees to report potential safety issues quickly and restructured the safety decision-making process to raise safety issues to the highest levels of the company. these measures are in addition to our creation and appointment of a new global vice president of vehicle safety responsible for the safety development of our vehicle systems, confirmation and validation of safety performance, as well as post-sale safety activities, including recalls and the creation of a new global product integrity organization within global product development with the goal of executing the highest levels of safety performance across all of our vehicles.
enhancements have also been incorporated through an ongoing process of continuous improvement into the safety and field investigation process to facilitate consistency in post-decision customer actions. improved investigative and consumer facing processes and standards are also being implemented globally to facilitate rapid and efficient sharing of information across regional teams and markets to aid decision making. another estimated 100 technical resources have been added globally in support of the revised alignment and process.
we are also actively engaging customers and servicing vehicles affected by the ignition switch recall. we notified affected customers to schedule an appointment with their dealers as replacement parts are available. we began repairing vehicles in early april using parts that have undergone end-of-line quality inspection for performance of six critical operating parameters. we have produced sufficient parts to have the ability to repair all vehicles impacted by the ignition switch and ignition cylinder recalls. through january 30, 2015 we have repaired approximately 59% of the 2.6 million vehicles subject to recall.
as a result of the ignition switch recall senior leadership initiated a comprehensive review and engineering analysis to identify any additional issues which could potentially result in safety or satisfaction concerns for our customers. as part of our normal process and as a result of these reviews we announced the following additional recall campaigns in 2014:
•   in the three months ended march 31, 2014 approximately 1.9 million vehicles were recalled to replace either the power steering motor, the steering column, the power steering motor control unit or a combination of the steering column and the power steering motor control unit as the electric power steering could fail under certain circumstances - model years 2004-2006, 2008-2009 chevrolet malibu, model years 2004-2006 malibu maxx, model years 2006-2010 hhr, model years 2005-2010 cobalt, model years 2008-2009 saturn aura, model years 2003-2007 ion, model years 2007-2010 pontiac g5, model years 2005-2006, 2008-2009 g6 and model years 2005-2006 pursuit and g4. we recorded approximately $340 million in automotive cost of sales to repair these vehicles.
•   in the three months ended june 30, 2014 approximately 1.4 million vehicles were recalled to replace the shift cable that could wear out over time resulting in mismatches of the gear position indicated by the shift lever - model years 2004-2008 chevrolet malibu, model years 2004-2007 malibu maxx, model years 2007-2008 saturn aura, model years 2013-2014 cadillac ats, model year 2014 cts and model years 2005-2008 pontiac g6. we recorded approximately $150 million in automotive cost of sales to repair these vehicles.
•   in the three months ended june 30, 2014 approximately 12.1 million vehicles were recalled to rework or replace ignition keys because the ignition switch may move out of the "run" position which may impact power steering and power braking.
general motors company and subsidiaries the timing of the key movement relative to the activation of the sensing algorithm of a crash event may result in airbags not deploying - model years 2005-2009 buick allure and lacrosse, model year 2004 regal ls/gs, model years 2006-2011 lucerne, model years 1997-2005 chevrolet malibu, model years 2000-2007 monte carlo, model years 2010-2014 camaro, model years 2000-2014 impala, model years 1998-2002 oldsmobile intrigue, model years 1999-2004 alero, model years 1999-2005 pontiac grand am, model years 2004-2008 grand prix, model years 2004-2006 cadillac srx, model years 2003-2014 cts, model years 2000-2005 deville and model years 2006-2011 dts. we recorded approximately $325 million in automotive cost of sales to repair these vehicles.
in the six months ended december 31, 2014 we announced the following recalls related to safety, customer satisfaction and other matters, the costs of which are comprehended in the june 30, 2014 catch-up adjustment of $874 million associated with a change in estimate for previously sold vehicles:
•   approximately 0.7 million vehicles were recalled to repair ignition mechanisms where the ignition key could be pulled out while the vehicle is in the run position - model years 2004-2007 saturn vue, model years 2005-2006 chevrolet equinox, model year 2006 pontiac torrent.
•   approximately 0.6 million vehicles were recalled to replace the wave plate in all vehicles with 6t70 and 6t75 transmissions which could crack under certain circumstances - model years 2007-2009 gmc acadia, pontiac g6, saturn aura and outlook, model years 2008-2009 buick enclave, chevrolet equinox and malibu, pontiac torrent, saturn vue, model year 2009 chevrolet traverse.
•   approximately 5.7 million vehicles were announced under 20 additional recalls, none of which were individually significant.
the following table summarizes the activity for customer satisfaction campaigns, safety recalls, non-compliance recalls and special coverage in gmna, including courtesy transportation (dollars in millions):
additions                          1,333               115

additions                            133               119
adjustments to prior periods in the three months ended june 30, 2014 included: (1) a catch-up adjustment associated with a change in estimate for previously sold vehicles of $874 million; partially offset by (2) adjustments of approximately $95 million for courtesy transportation as a result of greater part availability and fewer customers utilizing courtesy transportation than originally estimated; and (3) approximately $80 million for costs originally estimated separately for ignition switches and ignition lock cylinders that are now being shipped and repaired at the same time resulting in reduced costs. based on the per vehicle part and labor cost, number of vehicles impacted and the expected number of vehicles to be repaired we believe the amounts recorded are adequate to cover the costs of these recall campaigns.
adjustments to prior periods in the three months ended september 30, 2014 included an additional catch-up adjustment to our change in estimate for previously sold vehicles, which was partially offset by a change in estimate on a previously announced specific recall action due to reduced costs for both parts and labor. on a net basis, recall campaign and courtesy transportation adjustments for our previously sold vehicles increased approximately $52 million in the three months ended september 30, 2014.
adjustments to prior periods in the three months ended december 31, 2014 included an additional catch-up adjustment to our change in estimate for previously sold vehicles. on a net basis, recall campaign and courtesy transportation adjustments for our previously sold vehicles increased approximately $82 million in the three months ended december 31, 2014.
the ignition switch recall has led to various governmental investigations and inquiries including a subpoena from the u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york, and investigations by congress, the sec and various state attorneys general. in addition the ignition switch recall and the other recalls described above have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits. refer to note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

in the year ended december 31, 2013 ebit-adjusted decreased due primarily to: (1) unfavorable net vehicle mix primarily in the middle east due to deteriorated sales portfolio from the yukon, captiva, optra and australian markets due to deteriorated sales portfolio from high margin vehicles such as the cruze; (2) unfavorable vehicle pricing excluding $0.2 billion sales incentive related to withdrawal of the chevrolet brand from europe; (3) unfavorable net wholesale volumes; and (4) other of $0.3 billion due primarily to unfavorable manufacturing costs of $0.4 billion, unfavorable net foreign currency effect of $0.2 billion, and a decrease in sales of components, parts and accessories of $0.2 billion, partially offset by favorable material and freight cost of $0.3 billion, and increased equity income, net of tax of $0.2 billion, from our interest in the increased net income of our china jvs.
effective february 13, 2013 the venezuelan government set the official fixed exchange rate of the bolivar fuerte at bsf 6.3 to $1.00 from bsf 4.3 to $1.00. the devaluation resulted in a charge of $0.2 billion recorded in automotive cost of sales in the three months ended march 31, 2013 from the remeasurement of our venezuelan subsidiaries' non-u.s. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities. the remeasurement charge was treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes.
effective march 31, 2014 we changed the exchange rate we use for remeasuring our venezuelan subsidiaries' non-u.s. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the venezuela official exchange rate to the rate determined by an auction process conducted by venezuela's sicad i because we believe the sicad i rate is the most representative rate to be used for remeasurement. at march 31, 2014 the sicad i exchange rate was bsf 10.7 to $1.00. the devaluation resulted in a charge of $0.4 billion recorded in automotive cost of sales in the three months ended march 31, 2014. the remeasurement charge in the three months ended
general motors company and subsidiaries march 31, 2014 was treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes. in august 2014 the venezuelan government announced the sicad i rate as the official rate for the automotive industry going forward and clarified bsf 6.3 to $1.00 as the official rate for pre-existing debt settlements. gains on pre-existing debt settlements at more favorable rates than the sicad i exchange rate will not be recognized until collection is assured. at december 31, 2014 the sicad i exchange rate was bsf 12.0 to $1.00 and we recorded an insignificant net devaluation loss in automotive costs of sales in the nine months ended december 31, 2014. the non-u.s. dollar denominated assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiaries may be impacted by periodic auctions in sicad i rates which may have a material impact on the results of operations in venezuela in future periods. based on our december 31, 2014 non-u.s. dollar denominated net monetary assets a charge of less than $0.1 billion would result for every 10% devaluation of the bsf from the sicad i exchange rate of bsf 12.0 to $1.00 in the period of devaluation.
the venezuelan government has foreign exchange control regulations that make it difficult to convert bsf to u.s. dollar and affect our venezuelan subsidiaries' ability to pay non-bsf denominated obligations and to pay dividends. the total amounts pending government approval for settlement in u.s. dollar at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 were bsf 3.5 billion (equivalent to $0.5 billion) and bsf 3.7 billion (equivalent to $0.6 billion). these amounts include dividend requests in the amount of bsf 0.7 billion (equivalent to $0.1 billion) that have been pending from 2007. at december 31, 2014 we continued to consolidate our venezuelan subsidiaries because recent developments, including participation in sicad i auctions for new orders in august 2014, settlements of preexisting debt in october and november 2014 and execution of a labor agreement in november 2014 resulted in increases in production in the three months ended december 31, 2014. our venezuelan subsidiaries' net assets were $0.5 billion at december 31, 2014, including non-u.s. dollar denominated net monetary assets of $0.5 billion. at december 31, 2014 other consolidated entities had receivables from our venezuelan subsidiaries of $0.4 billion.
in january 2014 the venezuela government enacted a law limiting sale prices and establishing a maximum margin of 30% above a defined cost structure. because the venezuela government is still determining the application of certain aspects of this law it is unclear based on the current regulations how this new law may affect our current vehicle and parts and accessories sale pricing structure. these regulations, when considered with the foreign currency exchange regulations, high inflation, governmental policies negatively impacting our ability to implement labor force reductions and obtain vehicle imports licenses, the recent downward trend in the price of oil and other circumstances in venezuela, may impact our ability to fully benefit from and maintain our controlling financial interest in our venezuelan subsidiaries. the financial impact on our operations in venezuela of these events and associated ongoing restrictions are uncertain. if a determination is made in the future that we no longer maintain a controlling financial interest, we may incur a charge, based on current exchange rates, of up to $0.9 billion.

gm financial revenue in the year ended december 31, 2014 total revenue increased due primarily to: (1) increased finance charge income of $0.9 billion due to the acquisition of ally financial international operations; and (2) increased leased vehicle income of $0.5 billion due to a larger lease portfolio.

liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview we believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. we expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations. we also maintain access to the capital markets, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. our future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are centered around three objectives: (1) reinvest in our business; (2) continue to strengthen our balance sheet; and (3) return cash to stockholders. our known future material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of approximately $9.0 billion as well as payments for engineering and product development activities; (2) payments associated with recently announced vehicle recalls and the program of approximately $1.2 billion; (3) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including contributions to non-u.s. pension plans and u.s. non-qualified plans of approximately $1.2 billion; (4) payments for previously announced restructuring activities of approximately $1.0 billion; (5) acquiring ally financial's equity interests in saic-gmac of approximately $1.0 billion (acquisition completed in january 2015); and (6) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our board of directors.
our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in item 1a. risk factors section of this 2014 form 10-k, some of which are outside our control. macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans and compliance with certain covenants. refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for the discussion of our financial and operational covenants.
recent management initiatives we continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet and competitive position over the long term. these actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations while maintaining minimal automotive financial leverage as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. these actions may include additional loans, investments with our joint venture partners or the acquisitions of certain operations or ownership stakes in outside businesses. these actions may negatively impact our liquidity in the short term including the payments related to our recent recalls and the related litigation.
in october 2014 we amended our two primary revolving credit facilities, increasing our aggregate borrowing capacity from $11.0 billion to $12.5 billion. these facilities consist of a three-year, $5.0 billion facility and a five-year, $7.5 billion facility. both facilities are available to the company as well as certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, including gm financial. the three-year, $5.0 billion facility allows for borrowings in u.s. dollars and other currencies and includes a gm financial borrowing sub-limit of $2.0 billion, a letter of credit sub-facility of $1.6 billion and a brazilian real sub-facility of $0.3 billion. the five-year, $7.5 billion facility allows for borrowings in u.s. dollars and other currencies and includes a gm financial borrowing sub-limit of $2.0 billion, a letter of credit sub-limit of $0.5 billion and a brazilian real sub-facility of $0.2 billion.
automotive available liquidity total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and funds available under revolving credit facilities. the amount of available liquidity is subject to intra-month and seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations.
we manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. available liquidity held within north america and at our regional treasury centers represented approximately 87% of our available liquidity at december 31, 2014. a portion of our available liquidity includes amounts deemed indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. we have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.
our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars and include investments in u.s. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits and corporate debt securities. our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. substantially all of our current investments in debt securities are with a/a2 or better rated issuers.
we use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity and to fund working capital needs at certain of our subsidiaries. the total size of our credit facilities was $12.6 billion and $11.2 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013 which consisted primarily of the revolving credit facilities previously disclosed. we did not borrow against our two primary facilities, but had amounts in use under the letter of credit sub-facility of $0.5 billion at december 31, 2014. at december 31, 2014 gm financial had access to the revolving credit facilities, but did not borrow against them. in september 2014 the collateral previously securing these revolving credit facilities was released upon obtaining an investment grade corporate rating from both moody's investor service (moody's) and standard & poor's (s&p).

general motors company and subsidiaries rating actions taken by each of the credit rating agencies from january 1, 2014 through january 30, 2015 were as follows:
dbrs limited: assigned revolving credit facilities rating of bbb (low) in october 2014.
fitch: assigned a rating of bb+ to our senior unsecured notes issued in november 2014. assigned revolving credit facilities rating of bb+ in october 2014.
moody's: assigned a rating of ba1 to our senior unsecured notes issued in november 2014. assigned revolving credit facilities rating of baa3 in october 2014.
s&p: assigned a rating of bbb- to our senior unsecured notes issued in november 2014. assigned revolving credit facilities rating of bbb- in october 2014. upgraded our corporate rating and senior unsecured rating to an investment grade rating of bbb- from bb+ and revised their outlook to stable from positive in september 2014.
improving credit ratings provides us with greater financial flexibility and a lower cost of borrowing. additionally the collateral formerly pledged to our revolving credit facilities was released in conjunction with achieving investment grade status from both moody's and s&p.
automotive financing - gm financial liquidity overview gm financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income, servicing fees, net distributions from secured debt, secured and unsecured debt borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. gm financial's primary uses of cash are purchases of finance receivables and leased vehicles, funding of commercial finance receivables, business acquisitions, repayment of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements for secured debt, operating expenses and interest costs. gm financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the mix of its debt.
available liquidity the following table summarizes gm financial's available liquidity (dollars in billions):
borrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets                       4.8                         1.6
borrowing capacity on committed unsecured lines of credit             0.5                         0.6
available liquidity                                                  $8.3                        $3.3
the increase in available liquidity is due primarily to the issuance of $4.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in the year ended december 31, 2014, as well as the capital contribution from gm of $0.7 billion for the purchase of ally financial's equity interests in saic-gmac.
as previously mentioned gm financial has the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion against each of our three-year, $5.0 billion and five-year, $7.5 billion revolving credit facilities. in september 2014 we and gm financial entered into a support agreement which, among other things, established commitments of funding from us to gm financial. this agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of gm financial's outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities remain outstanding at gm financial. in addition we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure gm financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities.
credit facilities in the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, gm financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and gm financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. at december 31, 2014 secured and committed unsecured credit facilities totaled $18.8 billion and $1.3 billion, with advances outstanding of $7.0 billion and $0.8 billion.
general motors company and subsidiaries cash flow the following table summarizes gm financial cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities (dollars in billions):
net cash provided by operating activities        $1.9                $1.6                $1.0        $0.3                                   $0.6
net cash used in investing activities          $(10.5    )          $(8.2    )          $(2.8    )   $(2.3                     )            $(5.4                     )
net cash provided by financing activities        $9.8                $5.1                $2.3        $4.7                                   $2.8
operating activities in the year ended december 31, 2014 net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to larger finance receivable and lease portfolios.
in the year ended december 31, 2013 net cash provided by operating activities increased due primarily to the acquisitions of the ally financial international operations.
investing activities in the year ended december 31, 2014 net cash used in investing activities increased due primarily to: (1) increased loan purchases and funding, net of collections, of $2.6 billion; and (2) increased purchases of leased vehicles of $2.5 billion; partially offset by (3) decreased cash used for business acquisitions of $2.6 billion.
in the year ended december 31, 2013 net cash used in investing activities increased due primarily to: (1) increased funding of commercial finance receivables of $19.9 billion and purchase of consumer finance receivables of $4.0 billion; (2) net cash payment of $2.6 billion made in the current year on the acquisitions of the ally financial international operations; (3) increased purchases of leased vehicles of $1.2 billion; and (4) an increase in restricted cash of $0.6 billion; partially offset by (5) increased collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $22.8 billion.
financing activities in the year ended december 31, 2014 net cash provided by financing activities increased due primarily to: (1) increased borrowings under secured and unsecured debt of $5.6 billion; and (2) repayment of debt to ally financial of $1.4 billion in 2013, with no related activity in 2014; partially offset by (3) increased debt repayment of $2.8 billion.
in the year ended december 31, 2013 net cash provided by financing activities increased due primarily to: (1) increased borrowings under secured and unsecured debt of $14.0 billion; partially offset by (2) increased debt repayment of $9.7 billion; and (3) the repayment of $1.4 billion in certain debt assumed as part of the acquisitions of the ally financial international operations.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize off-balance sheet securitization arrangements. all trade or financing receivables and related obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2014 and 2013.
contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities we have minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations. a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. other long-term liabilities are defined as long-term liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. based on this definition, the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations. the majority of our purchases are not included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities.
general motors company and subsidiaries the following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities at december 31, 2014 (dollars in millions):
capital lease obligations                                180                 433                   110                     245                    968
postretirement benefits(c)                               235                  25                     -                       -                    260
contractual commitments for capital expenditures         252                   -                     -                       -                    252
other contractual commitments:
total contractual commitments(d)                     $25,557             $21,747                $8,210                 $15,874                $71,388
non-contractual postretirement benefits(e)              $168                $752                  $749                 $10,827                $12,496
(a)   amounts include automotive interest payments based on contractual terms and current interest rates on our debt and capital lease obligations. automotive interest payments based on variable interest rates were determined using the interest rate in effect at december 31, 2014.
(b)   gm financial interest payments were determined using the interest rate in effect at december 31, 2014 for floating rate debt and the contractual rates for fixed rate debt. gm financial interest payments on floating rate tranches of the securitization notes payable were converted to a fixed rate based on the floating rate plus any expected hedge payments.
(c)   amounts include other postretirement employee benefits (opeb) payments under the current u.s. contractual labor agreements through 2015 and canada labor agreements through 2016. these agreements are generally renegotiated in the year of expiration. amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed under the caption "critical accounting estimates - pensions."
(d)   amounts do not include future cash payments for long-term purchase obligations and other accrued expenditures (unless specifically listed in the table above) which were recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at december 31, 2014.
(e)   amounts include all expected future payments for both current and expected future service at december 31, 2014 for opeb obligations for salaried employees and hourly opeb obligations extending beyond the current north american union contract agreements. amounts do not include pension funding obligations, which are discussed under the caption "critical accounting estimates - pensions."
the table above does not reflect product warranty and related liabilities of $9.6 billion and unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these amounts.
critical accounting estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. these estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.
pensions our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. the expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance
in december 2014 an investment policy study was completed for the u.s. pension plans. the study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved for the u.s. pension plans with resulting changes to the expected long-term rate of return on assets. the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 6.5% at december 31, 2013 to 6.4% at december 31, 2014.
another key assumption in determining net pension expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. we estimate this rate for u.s. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate yield curve to determine the present value of cash flows to calculate a single equivalent discount rate.
mortality assumptions for participants in our u.s. pension plans incorporate future mortality improvements from tables published by the society of actuaries (soa). we periodically review the mortality experience of our u.s. pension plans' participants against these assumptions. in the three months ended december 31, 2014 the soa issued new mortality and mortality improvement tables that raise life expectancies and thereby indicate the amount of estimated aggregate benefit payments to our u.s. pension plans' participants is increasing. we have incorporated the new soa mortality and mortality improvement tables into our december 31, 2014 measurement of our u.s. pension plans' benefit obligations. the change in these assumptions had the effect of increasing the december 31, 2014 u.s. pension plans' obligations by $2.2 billion.
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. the effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to expense over future periods. the unamortized pre-tax actuarial gain (loss) on our pension plans was $(4.6) billion and $1.4 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013. the change is due primarily to the decrease in discount rates and the change in mortality assumptions partially offset by actual asset returns in excess of assumed returns.
the underfunded status of the u.s. pension plans increased by $3.6 billion in the year ended december 31, 2014 to $10.9 billion at december 31, 2014 due primarily to: (1) an unfavorable effect of $5.9 billion from a decrease in discount rates; (2) an unfavorable effect of $2.2 billion from an increase in life expectancies, resulting in an increase in the benefit obligations; and (3) interest and service cost of $3.3 billion; partially offset by (4) a favorable effect of $7.3 billion from actual returns on plan assets.
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):
25 basis point increase in expected rate of return on assets   -$150                                  n/a                               -$35                                    n/a pursuant to the labor contract with the uaw, which expires in september 2015, a benefit unit represents the calculated pension payment associated with a specific benefit plan type. the following data illustrates the sensitivity of changes in pension expense and pension obligation due to changes in future benefit units based on the last remeasurement of the u.s. hourly pension plan at december 31, 2014 (dollars in millions):
effect on 2015 pension expense   effect on december 31, 2014 pbo one percentage point increase in benefit units   +$85                             +$263
one percentage point decrease in benefit units   -$83                             -$255
general motors company and subsidiaries contributions to our u.s. qualified pension plans for the next five years. we also maintain pension plans for employees in a number of countries outside the u.s. which are subject to local laws and regulations. except for canada and the united kingdom, most non-u.s. pension laws and regulations do not have specific funding requirements.
refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension contributions, investment strategies and long-term rate of return, weighted-average discount rate, the change in benefit obligation and related plan assets and future net benefit payments. refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category.
valuation of deferred tax assets the ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. if law is enacted that reduces the u.s. statutory rate, we would record a significant reduction to the net deferred tax assets and related increase to income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change.
sales incentives the estimated effect of sales incentives to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue, and in certain instances, as an increase to automotive cost of sales, at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealers. there may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time, including a choice of incentives for a specific model. incentive programs are generally brand specific, model specific or sales region specific and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include the volume of vehicles that will be affected by the incentive programs offered by product, product mix, the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning customer behavior and future market conditions. when an incentive program is announced, the number of vehicles in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of automotive net sales and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales is recorded in the period in which the program is announced. if the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid, the reduction in automotive net sales and revenue or increase to automotive cost of sales for sales incentives could be affected. there are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales incentives and an increase or decrease of any of these variables could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives.
policy, product warranty and recall campaigns we have historically accrued estimated costs related to recall campaigns in gmna when they are probable and reasonably estimable, which typically occurs once it is determined a specific recall campaign is needed and announced. during the three months ended june 30, 2014, following the significant increase in the number of vehicles subject to recall in gmna, the results of our ongoing comprehensive safety review, additional engineering analysis, the creation of a new global product integrity organization, the appointment of a new global vice president of vehicle safety responsible for the safety development of our vehicle systems and our overall commitment to customer satisfaction, we accumulated sufficient historical data in gmna to support the use of an actuarial-based estimation technique for recall campaigns. as such we now accrue at the time of vehicle sale in gmna the costs for recall campaigns. in the three months ended june 30, 2014 we recorded a catch-up adjustment of $0.9 billion in automotive cost of sales to adjust the estimate for recall costs for previously sold vehicles. the change in estimate was treated as an adjustment for ebit-adjusted reporting purposes. in the other regions, there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarial-based estimation technique and the estimated costs will continue to be accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable, which typically occurs once it is determined a specific recall campaign is needed and announced.
the estimates related to policy and product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. when little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models. the
general motors company and subsidiaries estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a frequency times severity approach that considers the number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. estimates contemplate the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical events with consideration for changes in future expectations. costs associated with campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the per unit part and labor cost, number of units impacted and the take rate. depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time-to-time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. these estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information, revisions are made when necessary. we consider trends of claims and take action to improve vehicle quality and minimize claims.
in the six months ended june 30, 2014 we recorded charges of $2.5 billion for recall campaigns and courtesy transportation that have been separately announced and $0.9 billion related to the catch-up adjustment associated with a change in estimate. the catch-up adjustment and estimated amount accrued at the time of a vehicle sale for recall campaigns is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the take rate, and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. the estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. we believe the amounts recorded are adequate to cover the costs of these recall campaigns. a 10% increase in the estimated take rate for specifically announced recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.2 billion.
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.

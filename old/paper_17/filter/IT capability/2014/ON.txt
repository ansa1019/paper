executive overview this executive overview presents summary information regarding our industry, markets, business and operating trends only. for further information relating to the information summarized herein, see part ii, item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in its entirety.
industry overview according to wsts (an industry research firm), worldwide semiconductor industry sales were $335.8 billion in 2014, an increase of approximately 9.9% from $305.6 billion in 2013. we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the market in the areas we provide semiconductor components. the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our serviceable addressable market (sam) since 2010:
worldwide                                serviceable semiconductor                         addressable market industry sales (1)    percentage                sales (1) (2)    percentage year ended december 31,            (in billions)        change                (in billions)        change
based on shipment information published by wsts. wsts collects this information based on product shipments, which differs from how we recognize revenue on shipments to certain distributors as described in note 2: significant accounting policiesrevenue recognition in the
(1)  notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. we believe the data provided by wsts is reliable, but we have not independently verified it. wsts periodically revises its information. we assume no obligation to update such information.
our sam comprises the following specific wsts product categories: (a) discrete products (all discrete semiconductors other than sensors, microwave power transistors/modules, microwave diodes, and microwave transistors, power modules, logic and optoelectronics); (b) standard analog products (amplifiers, vregs and references, comparators, assp consumer, assp communications, assp computer, assp
standard product logic (consumer other, computer other peripherals, wired / wireless communications, automotive, industrial and multipurpose); (e) cmos and ccd image sensors; (f) memory; (g) microcontrollers and (h) motor control modules. our sam is derived using the most recent information available at the time of the filing of each respective periods annual report and is revised in subsequent periods to reflect final results.
2013, and grew 9.9% in 2014 following a pattern associated with the financial crisis, subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty. the increase of 9.9% from 2013 to 2014 is related to improved global macroeconomic conditions within the semiconductor industry affecting sales in all geographic regions .
billion in 2012, increased to $104.3 billion in 2013 and increased to $112 billion in 2014. the increase of approximately 7.4% from $104.3 billion in 2013 to $112 billion in 2014 is consistent with the trend in the worldwide semiconductor market. the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our sam of approximately 3% for the next three years. these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results.
recent results our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $3,161.8 million, an increase of approximately 14%
from $2,782.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the majority of the increase was attributable to our acquisitions of aptina and truesense, along with other increases in our application products group and standard products group, partially offset by decreased revenue from our system solutions group .during 2014, we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor corporation of $189.7 million compared to net income attributable to on semiconductor corporation of $150.4 million in 2013. our gross margin increased by approximately 90 basis points to
34.3% in 2014 from 33.4% in 2013, primarily driven by changes in volume and mix across certain of our product lines.
during 2014, the majority of our restructuring and cost saving initiatives were focused on our system solutions group, which included certain voluntary retirement programs and the planned closure of our kss facility.
for further information with respect to our restructuring activity, including our other restructuring and cost savings programs initiated during 2014, see note 6: restructuring, asset impairments, and other, net of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report.

historically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical. during a down cycle, unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem, resulting in revenue declines. in response to such declines, manufacturers have reduced or shut down production capacity. when new applications or other factors have caused demand to strengthen, production volumes have historically stabilized and then grown again. as market unit demand reaches levels above capacity production capabilities, shortages begin to occur, which typically causes pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers, thus prompting further capacity expansion. such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand, which has triggered another similar cycle.
business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities we have recognized efficiencies from implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure. however, the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. while there have been recent indications of improving conditions, our business environment continues to experience significant uncertainty and volatility. we have historically reviewed, and will continue to review, our cost structure, capital investments and other expenditures to align our spending and capacity with our current sales and manufacturing projections.
we have historically taken significant actions to align our overall cost structure with our expected revenue levels. such actions continued in 2014 within our system solutions group. see results of operations under the heading restructuring, asset impairments and other, net below, along with note 6: restructuring, asset impairments and other, net of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for further details relating to our most recent cost saving actions.
outlook on semiconductor q1 2015 outlook based upon product booking trends, backlog levels, and estimated turns levels, we estimate that our revenues will be approximately $840 million to $880 million in the first quarter of 2015. backlog levels for the first quarter of
2015 represent approximately 80% to 85% of our anticipated first quarter 2015 revenues. we estimate average selling prices for the first quarter of 2015 will be down approximately two percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.
for the first quarter of 2015, we estimate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be approximately
results of operations our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 include the operations of our acquisitions of aptina and truesense on august 15, 2014 and april 30, 2014, respectively.
revision of previously-issued financial statements during the quarter ended december 31, 2014, we revised our financial statements for 2013 and 2012 to record a deferred tax asset in a foreign subsidiary and have made adjustments in each successive period related to the foreign currency exchange rate changes associated with that item. the prior periods also include revised amounts from a change in application of an accounting convention, related to manufacturing variances, and other adjustments relating to hedging and inventory amounts. these other previously-identified errors were either uncorrected or corrected in a period subsequent to the period in which the error originated.
we assessed the effect of the above errors in the aggregate on prior periods financial statements in accordance with the secs staff accounting bulletins no. 99 and 108 and, based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors, determined that the errors were not material to any of our prior interim and annual financial statements.
all financial information contained herein has been revised to reflect the correction of these errors. see note 1:

revenues revenues were $3,161.8 million, $2,782.7 million and $2,894.9 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase from 2013 to 2014 was primarily attributed to approximately $262.4 million of additional revenue in the image sensor group provided by the acquisitions of aptina and truesense, along with increases from our application products group and standard products group, which experienced greater revenue as a result of an improved demand environment. the increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased revenue from our system solutions group.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, we experienced a decline in average selling prices of approximately 5%, as compared to 2013, offset by favorable changes in volume and mix, which resulted in a net increase in revenue of approximately 14%.
the decrease in revenues from 2012 to 2013 was the result of decreased revenue in our system solutions group from a weakened demand environment associated with a further softening of the japanese consumer market and a devalued yen, which was partially offset by increased revenue from our other reportable segments.
revenues by reportable segment for each of the three years below, were as follows (dollars in millions):
revenues from the application products group revenues from the application products group increased by $73.6 million, or approximately 7%, from 2013 to 2014 and increased from 2012 to 2013 by $27.2 million or approximately 3%.
this increase in 2014 is primarily attributable to revenue provided by the 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense, which generated approximately $262.4 million, of revenue during 2014. revenues from our existing image sensor business units also increased during 2014.
the 2014 decrease resulted from a decrease in demand from the japanese consumer market and an increase in competition in other regions, causing a decrease in revenue from lsi products of approximately $53.8 million, or approximately 13.0%.
the 2013 decrease resulted from a softening of the japanese consumer market, a devalued yen, and, to a lesser extent, political tensions between japan and china.
revenues by geographic location revenues by geographic location, including local sales made by operations within each area, based on sales billed from the respective country, are summarized as follows (in millions):
united       $       497.0         15.7  %    $       415.4          14.9  %    $        452.0          15.6  %

for additional information, see the table of revenues by geographic location included in note 18: segment information of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
gross profit and gross margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below)
our gross profit by reportable segment in each of the three years below was as follows (dollars in millions):
group gross profit     $   1,114.6                       $      949.7                       $    1,003.2
profit
(1)  unallocated manufacturing costs are being shown as a percentage of total revenue.
our gross profit was $1,084.9 million, $929.1 million and $946.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively. the gross profit increase of $155.8 million, or approximately 17%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to increased revenues, along with increased capacity utilization and cost savings realized from previous restructuring activities, partially offset by decreased average selling prices and approximately $27.0 million for the expensing of the fair market value of inventory step-up from our recent acquisitions for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the gross profit decrease from 2012 to 2013 is primarily attributable to decreases in gross profit in our system solution group as a result of lower revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013 as well as smaller decreases in gross profit from our other operating segments.
gross margin increased to approximately 34.3% during 2014 compared to approximately 33.4% during 2013. this increase was primarily driven by favorable changes in volume and mix across certain product lines as well as a larger proportion of revenues generated from our applications products group, image sensor group and standard products group which experienced higher gross margin levels than our system solutions group.
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues from 2012 to 2013 was primarily driven by changes in volume and mix across certain product lines.
operating expenses research and development research and development expenses were $366.6 million, $334.2 million and $367.5 million, representing approximately 11.6%, 12.0% and 12.7% of revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the increase in research and development expenses of $32.4 million, or approximately 10%, from 2013 to 2014 is primarily associated with approximately $38.0 million of expenses attributable to our 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense. these expenses were further increased by greater personnel costs in our application products group and standard products group, along with increased performance-based compensation as a result of improved performance results for 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by decreases in our system solutions group attributable to decreased payroll related expenses resulting from our restructuring and cost saving activities.
the decrease in research and development expenses from 2012 to 2013 was primarily associated with decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group, along with the impact of a devalued yen.
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were $200.0 million, $171.2 million and $180.9 million, representing approximately
6.3%, 6.2% and 6.2% of revenues, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the increase in selling and marketing expenses of $28.8 million, or approximately 17%, from 2013 to 2014 is primarily associated with approximately $11.2 million of expenses attributable to our 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense, along with increased sales commissions and increased payroll related expenses associated with performance-based compensation as a result of improved performance results for 2014 compared to 2013.
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group, along with the impact of a devalued yen.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were $180.9 million, $148.5 million and $160.6 million, representing approximately 5.7%, 5.3% and 5.5% of revenues, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the increase in general and administrative expenses of $32.4 million, or approximatively 22%, from 2013 to 2014 is primarily associated with approximately $9.6 million of expenses attributable to our 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense, along with increased payroll related expenses associated with performance-based compensation as a result of improved performance results for 2014 compared to 2013, in addition to approximately $8.1 million in third-party acquisition-related expenses.
the decrease in general and administrative expenses from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group, along with the impact of a devalued yen.
amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $68.4 million, $33.1 million and $44.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase of $35.3 million from 2013 to 2014 is attributable to the amortization of intangible assets assumed as a result of our acquisitions of aptina and truesense. see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
the decrease in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributed to the impairment of certain of the system solutions groups intangible assets recorded during the fourth quarter of
2012. see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
restructuring, asset impairments and other, net restructuring, asset impairments and other, net was $30.5 million, $33.2 million and $163.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the information below summarizes the major
activities in each year. for additional information, see note 6: restructuring, asset impairments and other, net
of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, we initiated a voluntary retirement program for employees of certain of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan (the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program). approximately 350
employees opted to retire under the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, of which all employees had exited by december 31, 2014. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized approximately $10.4 million of employee separation charges related to the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program.
in connection with the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, approximately 70 contractor positions were also identified for elimination, all of which all had exited by the end of 2014. during the year ended december 31,
2014, an additional 40 positions were identified for elimination, as an extension of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, consisting of 20 employees and 20 contractors, substantially all of which had exited by december 31, 2014.
as a result of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, we recognized a pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees of $4.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014, which is recorded in restructuring, asset impairments and other, net. see note 11: employee benefit plans of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we initiated further voluntary retirement activities applicable to an additional 60 to 70 positions, for certain of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan, consisting of employees and contractors. substantially all personnel had exited under this program by december 31, 2014. we anticipate total cost savings for the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, which includes the above headcounts, to be between the range of our previously disclosed expectations of $36 million to $45 million during the first year following the completion of the anticipated headcount reductions.
on october 6, 2013, we announced a plan to close kss (the kss plan). pursuant to the kss plan, a majority of the production from kss was transferred to other of our manufacturing facilities. the kss plan includes the elimination of approximately 170 full time and 40 contract employees. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded approximately $7.8 million of employee separation charges and $2.3 million of exit costs related to the kss plan.
as a result of the kss facility closure, we recognized a $2.1 million pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees during the year ended december 31, 2014, which is recorded in restructuring, asset impairments and other, net. see note 11: employee benefit plans of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we initiated two voluntary retirement programs for certain employees of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan. approximately 500 employees opted to retire pursuant to the first program, and substantially all employees had retired by december 31, 2013. approximately 170 employees had retired by december 31, 2013 under the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program. as part of these restructuring activities, approximately half of the 70 contractor positions identified for elimination were terminated by the end of 2013.
we recorded net charges of approximately $37.3 million in connection with these programs, consisting of employee severance charges of $52.9 million, partially offset by pension and related retirement liability adjustments associated with the affected employees, which resulted in a pension curtailment benefit of $15.6 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded $3.1 million of restructuring charges related to the announced closure of our aizu facility. we also released approximately $21.0 million of associated cumulative foreign currency translation gains related to our subsidiary that owned the aizu facility, which utilized the japanese yen as its functional currency. the related amount was recorded as a benefit to restructuring, asset impairments and other, net on the our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. for additional information, see note 16: changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
we recorded approximately $10.0 million of net restructuring charges related to the kss plan during the year ended december 31, 2013, consisting of employee severance charges of $6.5 million and $3.5 million of asset impairment charges associated with the kss plan.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we initiated a voluntary retirement program for certain employees of our system solutions group and certain of its subsidiaries. we recorded net charges of approximately $35.9 million associated with this program, consisting of employee severance charges of $47.6 million, partially offset by $11.7
million attributed to pension plan curtailment gains.
additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2012, we executed a global workforce reduction program.
restructuring expenses resulting from this program consisted primarily of $11.2 million associated with employee severance charges.
we incurred additional charges related to the closure of certain of our facilities during 2012.
indefinite and long-lived asset impairment charges
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we determined that approximately $8.7 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to one of our reporting units in the application products group was impaired resulting from a decline in estimated future cash flows. in connection with this impairment, we wrote-off approximately $0.9 million of intangible assets and $4.7 million of other long-lived assets. see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we evaluated the current period operating results of the system solutions group and re-assessed future projections for the segment. as a result, we determined that $94.4 million of carrying value for certain long-lived assets associated with the system solutions group and $31.6 million of related intangible assets were impaired. for additional information, see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we further determined that approximately $14.1 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to our 2008 acquisition of catalyst was impaired resulting from a strategic decision to invest in other business units and the resulting decline in estimated future cash flows. as part of our annual goodwill testing, it was determined that certain intangible assets associated with the standard products group were impaired. in connection with this impairment, we wrote-off approximately $3.8 million of intangible assets. these goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were recognized in our standard products group segment. see note
5: goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
other income and expenses interest expense interest expense decreased by $4.5 million from $38.6 million in 2013 to $34.1 million in 2014. additionally, interest expense decreased by $17.5 million from $56.1 million in 2012 to $38.6 million in 2013. we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of $7.0 million, $11.2 million and $23.4 million for 2014, 2013
and 2012, respectively. our average long-term debt balance (including current maturities and net of debt discount)
during 2014, 2013 and 2012, was $1,067.4 million, $977.1 million and $1,109.5 million, respectively. our weighted average interest rate on long-term debt (including current maturities and net of debt discount) was approximately
3.2%, 3.9% and 5.1% per annum in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. see liquidity and capital resourceskey financing and capital events below for a description of our refinancing activities.
other other income decreased by $5.9 million from a gain of $1.5 million in 2013 to a loss of $4.4 million in 2014. other income decreased by $4.3 million from a gain of $5.8 million in 2012 to a gain of $1.5 million in 2013. the change from year to year is largely attributable to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the dollar for the periods presented, net of the impact from our hedging activity.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we exchanged $60.0 million in principal value ($57.4 million of carrying value) of our 2.625% notes for $58.5 million in principal value of our 2.625% notes, series b, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2.625% notes, resulting in a loss on debt repurchase of $3.1 million. subject to certain other terms and conditions, this transaction extended the earliest put date for the exchanged amount from december
see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we exchanged $99.9 million in par value ($92.8 million of carrying value)
of our 2.625% notes for $99.9 million in par value of 2.625% notes, series b and $2.0 million in cash, which resulted in a loss on debt exchange of $7.8 million. subject to certain other terms and conditions, this exchange extended the first put date of the underlying notes, which we consider to be the earliest maturity date, from december 2013 to december 2016. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of $0.2 million and a provision of $16.4 million and $16.0 million in 2014, 2013
the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 consisted of the reversal of $23.3 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets as a result of a net deferred tax liability recorded as part of the truesense acquisition and the reversal of $4.6 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during the year ended december 31, 2014. this is partially offset by $19.8 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations, $4.6 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions, and $3.3 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill.
the 2013 provision of $16.4 million included $22.2 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and $0.9 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions and $2.7 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill. this is partially offset by the reversal of $6.0 million of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and the reversal of $3.4 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2013.
the 2012 provision of $16.0 million included $21.7 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations, $2.6 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill, and $0.9
million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions. this is partially offset by $7.8 million of additional tax benefit recorded and the reversal of $1.4 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2012.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates. our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was a benefit of 0.1%, which differs from the u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries. our effective tax rate was also lower than the u.s. statutory federal income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012 , due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries. we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our domestic and japan related deferred tax assets; however, it is reasonably possible that a substantial portion of the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets will be reversed within one year of december 31, 2014, which is not expected to have a material effect on the companys cash taxes. as of december 31, 2014, the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets was approximately $461.9 million.
income taxes have not been provided on approximately $1,784.1 million of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2014 over which we have sufficient influence to control the distribution of such earnings and have determined that substantially all such earnings have been reinvested indefinitely. these earnings could become subject to either or both federal income tax and foreign withholding tax if they are remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings are loaned to any of our domestic companies, or if we sell our investment in certain subsidiaries. we estimate that repatriation of these foreign earnings would generate additional taxes of approximately $178.7 million after the assumed utilization of our available net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits.

liquidity and capital resources this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements, off-balance sheet arrangements, contingencies, sources and uses of cash, operations, working capital, and long-term assets and liabilities.
contractual obligations our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our long-term debt, capital leases, operating leases and purchase obligations. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31, 2014 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future (in millions):
capital leases
capital                        43.2        21.9        13.6         6.1         0.8        0.8                 
capital purchase                       42.4        38.5         1.8         0.5         0.4        0.4              0.8
obligations inventory and external manufacturing                 454.9       279.3       105.1        37.7         8.1        7.8             16.9
purchase obligations information technology, communication                  10.9         9.0         1.4         0.3         0.1        0.1                 
and mainframe support services other                          18.7        13.6         4.1         0.4         0.4        0.2                 
obligations the table above excludes approximately $16.0 million of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits
(1)  because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement of such liabilities.
these represent our off-balance sheet arrangements (see liquidity and capital resourcesoff-balance sheet
(3)  arrangements for a description of our off-balance sheet arrangements).
this table also excludes our pension obligations. we expect to make cash contributions and future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements of approximately $8.5 million in 2015. this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements. the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. beyond 2015, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. see note 11: employee benefit plans
of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-kfor more information on our pension obligations.
our balance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $517.8 million at december 31, 2014. we believe that our cash flows from operations, coupled with our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at december 31, 2014 include approximately $203.6 million available in the united states. in addition to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments already on hand in the united states, we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states by settling loans with our foreign subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs, by utilizing existing credit facilities or through new bank loans or debt obligations.
we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states. we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements, common stock and debt repurchases, payments and acquisitions. if we are unable to address our u.s. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current debt agreements or other sources of cash obtained
at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
see note 8: long-term debt, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term debt.
see part ii, item 5 market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities included elsewhere in this report for a discussion of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and our stock repurchase activities.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business, we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system, desktop computers, communications, foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment.
in the normal course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us, as required for transactions including, but not limited to:
material purchase commitments; agreements to mitigate collection risk; leases; utilities; and customs guarantees.
our senior revolving credit facility includes $40.0 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit.
a $0.2 million letter of credit was outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2014.
we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our senior revolving credit facility of $6.3
as part of securing financing in the normal course of business, we issued guarantees related to our capital lease obligations, equipment financing, lines of credit and real estate mortgages, which totaled approximately $113.3
million as of december 31, 2014. we are also a guarantor of sci llcs non-collateralized loan with smbc, which had a balance of $235.9 million as of december 31, 2014. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
based on historical experience and information currently available, we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements.
for our operating leases, we expect to make cash payments and incur similar expenses totaling $103.6 million as payments come due. we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases, letters of credit and guarantee arrangements. see note 12: commitments and contingencies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
contingencies we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements. some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement, property damage including environmental contamination, personal injury, failure to comply with applicable laws, our negligence or willful misconduct, or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets.
we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in economic damages, bodily injury or property damage. in addition, if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective, we may be
required to participate in their recall. depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors, we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims.
we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors, officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements, certificates of incorporation, by-laws, articles of association or similar organizational documents, as the case may be. we maintain directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification, other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. historically, payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
see part i, item 3 legal proceedings and note 12: commitments and contingencies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for possible contingencies related to legal matters. see also part i, item 1 businessgovernment regulation for information on certain environmental matters.
sources and uses of cash we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for research and development, to make capital expenditures, for strategic acquisitions and investments, to repurchase our common stock and other company securities, and to pay debt service, including principal and interest and capital lease payments. our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances. in the near term, we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand, including short-term investments.
as part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis. on august 15, 2014, we completed the purchase of aptina, for a total purchase price of approximately $405.4
million in cash, of which approximately $2.9 million remained unpaid and approximately $40.0 million was held in escrow as of december 31, 2014. on april 30, 2014, we completed the purchase of truesense, for a total purchase price of approximately $95.7 million in cash. see note 4: acquisitions of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include:
factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows, including the impact on our business and operations as a result of changes in demand for our products, competitive pricing pressures, effective management of our manufacturing capacity, our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses, the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business;
and factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise, including interest rate fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing, and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time.
our ability to service our long-term debt, including our 2.625% notes, series b, to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital, capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to, among other things, our future operating performance, as well as to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control.
if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives. there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or, if available, will be at rates or prices acceptable to us. we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs, as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements, through at least the next twelve months. to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans, our liquidity may be adversely impacted.
during the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures for inventory, operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand. during 2014, we paid $204.3 million for capital expenditures, while in 2013 we paid $155.2 million. our current projection for capital expenditures in 2015 is approximately $250
million to $270 million, of which our current minimum commitment is approximately $38.5 million. the capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives.
on october 10, 2013, we entered into an $800.0 million, five-year senior revolving credit facility. the new credit agreement amended and restated our prior agreement dated as of december 23, 2011 and significantly increased our liquidity as described under key financing and capital events2013 financing eventsamended and restated senior revolving credit facility. we borrowed approximately $350.0 million of the $800.0 million available under the new facility. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
on december 1, 2014, we announced a capital allocation policy (the capital allocation policy) under which we intend to return approximately 80 percent of free cash flow less repayments of long-term debt to shareholders, subject to a variety of factors, including our strategic plans, market and economic conditions and the boards discretion. for the purposes of the capital allocation policy, we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. we also announced the 2014 share repurchase program pursuant to the capital allocation policy. under the 2014 share repurchase program, we intend to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our common shares over a four year period, subject to the same factors and considerations described above. the 2014 share repurchase program was effective december 1, 2014, and the $300
million 2012 stock repurchase program was terminated on that date. see part ii, item 5. market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information with respect to our share repurchase programs.
cash management our ability to manage cash is limited, as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements, contractual obligations, debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements. while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases, we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products.
primary cash flow sources our long-term cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash. our cash flows from operations is summarized as follows (in millions):
for the year ended december 31,
summarized cash flow from operating activities net income (loss)                           $         192.1       $  153.6       $   (92.9  )
adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:
write-down of excess inventories                       40.6           51.9            51.9
impairment charges non-cash foreign currency translation                                (21.0  )             
gain change in deferred taxes                              (18.8  )         1.4            (1.9  )
changes in assets and liabilities
(exclusive of the impact of acquisitions):
other long-term liabilities                           (15.5  )       (48.9  )        (12.4  )
other changes in assets and liabilities               (25.4  )        40.8            (4.0  )
activities our cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by approximately
$154.0 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase is primarily attributable to higher net sales, cost savings realized from our previously enacted restructuring programs and lower cash outflows from our restructuring activities.
our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on, among other factors, our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets.
our management of our assets and liabilities, including both working capital and long-term assets and liabilities, also influences our operating cash flows, and each of these components is discussed below.
working capital working capital, calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities, fluctuates depending on end-
market demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables, inventory and payables. in times of escalating demand, our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production. our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs, which may require us to use cash for severance payments, asset transfers and contract termination costs. in addition, our working capital may be affected by acquisitions, capital activities as part of our share repurchase programs and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments. our working capital, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, was $765.0 million at december 31, 2014 and has fluctuated between
$913.1 million and $743.5 million over the last eight quarter-ends. although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances, these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our working capital was most
significantly impacted by our capital expenditures, the acquisition of aptina and truesense, the repurchase of our common stock and the payments associated with our restructuring activities. see note 8: long-term debt, note 6:
restructuring, asset impairments, and other, net and note 9: earnings per share and equityof the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
long-term assets and liabilities our long-term assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.
our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently. we believe that near-term access to additional manufacturing capacity, should it be required, could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties.
we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity.
our long-term liabilities, excluding long-term debt, consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves. in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans, generally, our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate. this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions. for additional information, see note 11: employee benefit plans of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k and see note 15: income taxes of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
key financing and capital events overview for the past several years, we have undertaken various measures to repurchase shares of our common stock, reduce our long-term debt, reduce related interest costs and, in some cases, extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility. certain of these measures continued in 2014. set forth below is a summary of certain key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years. for further discussion of our debt instruments see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
2014 financing events share repurchase program during the year ended december 31, 2014, we purchased approximately 13.9 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $121.0 million, exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses, at a weighted-average execution price of $8.71 per share. see part ii, item 5. market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information. see also see note 9: earnings per share and equity of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements under the heading equityshare repurchase program included elsewhere in this form 10-k for information on the share repurchase programs.
amounts drawn on amended and restated senior revolving credit facility during the third quarter of 2014, we drew an incremental amount of approximately $230.0 million to partially fund the purchase of aptina. the outstanding balance of the facility as of december 31, 2014 was $350.0 million. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
2013 financing events share repurchase program during the year ended december 31, 2013, we purchased approximately 13.9 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$101.3 million, exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses, at a weighted-average execution price per share of $7.29. see note 9: earnings per share and equity of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements under the heading equityshare repurchase program included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information on the share repurchase program.
convertible note exchange during the year ended december 31, 2013, we exchanged $60.0 million in principal value ($57.4 million of carrying value) of our 2.625% notes for $58.5 million in principal value of our 2.625% notes, series b, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2.625% notes, resulting in a loss on debt repurchase of $3.1 million. subject to certain other terms and conditions, this exchange extended the earliest put date for the exchanged amount from december
2013 to december 2016. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information. this exchange, along with the exchange in 2012
described below, was based on the exemption from registration in section 3(a)(9) of the securities act of 1933, as amended.
retirement of 1.875% and 2.625% notes on january 28, 2013, we settled the conversion obligation on the outstanding 1.875% notes by delivering approximately $77.5 million in cash to the holders who tendered their 1.875% notes for conversion. the excess $4.1
million over the $73.4 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 1.875% notes was attributable to the conversion feature for the 1.875% notes. the settlement of the conversion obligation on january 28, 2013
on december 20, 2013, we exercised our option to redeem all of our outstanding 2.625% notes. as a result, we paid the gross principal amount of $72.6 million to the holders of the 2.625% notes and retired the outstanding obligation.
note payable to smbc on january 31, 2013, we amended and restated our seven-year non-collateralized loan obligation with sanyo electric.
in connection with the amendment and restatement of the loan agreement, sanyo electric assigned all of its rights under the loan agreement to smbc.
see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
amended and restated senior revolving credit facility on october 10, 2013, we entered into an $800 million, five-year senior revolving credit facility (the facility), the terms of which are set forth in an amended and restated credit agreement dated as of october 10, 2013 (the
credit agreement). the facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, stock repurchase, and/or acquisitions. the increase in amount of the facility further enhances our profile and provides financial flexibility to support long-term business and financial objectives. following entry into the credit agreement, we borrowed $120 million of the $800 million available under the facility. the facility includes $40
million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit, $15 million of availability for swingline loans for short-term borrowings and a foreign currency sublimit of $75 million. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
2012 financing events share repurchase program during the year ended december 31, 2012, we purchased approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock under a share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $55.3 million, exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses, at a weighted-average price per share of $6.26. see note 9: earnings per share and equity under the heading equityshare repurchase program of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
convertible note exchange during the year ended december 31, 2012, we exchanged $99.9 million in par value ($92.8 million of carrying value)
of our 2.625% notes for $99.9 million in par value of our 2.625% notes, series b and $2.0 million in cash, resulting in a loss on debt repurchase of $7.8 million, which included the write-off of $0.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. subject to certain other terms and conditions, this exchange extended the earliest put date for the exchanged amount from december 2013 to december 2016. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
redemption of 1.875% notes during the year ended december 31, 2012, we redeemed approximately $21.6 million in aggregate principal value of our 1.875% notes for approximately $21.6 million in cash.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we exercised a call option relating to our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024. as a result, we paid the aggregate principal amount of $96.2 million to the holders of the notes and retired the outstanding obligation.
debt guarantees and related covenants our 2.625% notes, series b are subordinated to the senior indebtedness of on semiconductor corporation and its guarantor subsidiaries, as defined in note 20: guarantor and non-guarantor statements of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k, on the terms described in the indentures for such notes. as of december 31, 2014, we believe that we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our
2.625% notes, series b and with covenants relating to our senior revolving credit facility and various other debt agreements.
see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements.
use of estimates. the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following: (i) measurement of valuation allowances relating to trade receivables, inventories and deferred tax assets; (ii) estimates of future payouts for customer incentives and allowances, warranties, and restructuring activities; (iii) assumptions surrounding future pension obligations; (iv) fair values of share-based compensation and of financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments); (v) evaluations of uncertain tax positions; (vi) estimates and assumptions used in connection with business combinations; and (vi) future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, if applicable. actual results could differ from these estimates.
revenue .we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems, electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors. we also generate revenue, although to a much lesser extent, from manufacturing services provided to customers. distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry, dependent on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement with distributors. some entities recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor, while others, like us, recognize revenue when the sale is made to the end customer, where the facts and circumstances of the distributor arrangements allow for such recognition. additionally, there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors, which may have an effect on our revenue recognition. due to our high distributor sales, revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy.
we recognize revenue on sales to oems, distributors that are not entitled to returns and allowances, and electronic manufacturing service providers, net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title and risk of loss pass to the customer (which is generally upon shipment), the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
for products sold to distributors who are entitled to returns and allowances, we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when we are informed by the distributor that it has resold the products to the end-user. as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effects of the returns and allowances with these distributors, we defer the related revenue and gross margin on sales to these distributors until we are informed by the distributor that the products have been resold to the end-user, at which point the ultimate sales price is known. although payment terms vary, most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days.
taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue-producing transactions, including value added and excise taxes, are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the statement of operations.
sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience. our oem customers do not have the right to return our products, other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty. sales to distributors, however, are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow-
moving products. under our general agreements, distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book. in addition, agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. however, since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors, sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations. provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized, and are netted against revenues. we review warranty and related claims activity and record provisions, as necessary.
we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our specifications. subject to certain exceptions, our standard warranty extends for a period of two years. at the time revenue is recognized, we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales, recorded as a component of cost of revenues. in addition, we also offer cash discounts to certain customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time, generally 10 days after shipment. we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues, based on experience with each customer.
freight and handling costs are included in the cost of revenues and are recognized as period expenses during the period in which they are incurred.
inventories .we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or market and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end-user demand. these provisions can influence our results from operations. for example, when demand falls for a given part, all or a portion of the related inventory which is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved, impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit. if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold, we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin. however, the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded. although we do sell some products that have previously been written down, such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material.
deferred tax valuation allowance .we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. in determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. conversely, if we determine that we will more likely than not be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense. we maintain a valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets and most of our foreign deferred tax assets.
i mpairment of long-lived assets .we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable. impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount. impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results. we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group. the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests. in recent years, most of our asset groups that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned, sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities. in some instances, these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value with related gains recorded in the restructuring, asset impairment and other, net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements.
goodwill .we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows, discount and long-term growth rates. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows. estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments. the assumptions about future conditions include factors such as future revenues, gross profits, operating expenses, and industry trends. changes in these estimates based on evolving economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods. we consider other valuation methods, such as the cost approach or market approach, if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. actual future results may differ from those estimates. we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analysis.
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. if the carrying value of the net assets associate with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. if, during this second step, we determine that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
we have determined that our product families, which are components of our operating segments, constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill. our product families are one level below the operating segments, constituting individual businesses with our segment management conducting regular reviews of the operating results for each product family. as of each acquisition date, all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition. the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the acquired business included in a reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date.
our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2015;
however, identification of a triggering event may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods.
defined benefit pension plans and related benefits .we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our non-u.s. employees. for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension costs and estimated withdrawal liabilities are determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates for plan obligations, assumed rates of return on pension plan assets and assumed rates of compensation increase for employees participating in the plans. these assumptions are based upon managements judgment and consultation with actuaries, considering all known trends and uncertainties. actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans. as of december 31, 2014, a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately $35.0
contingencies .we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. based on the available information, we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable.

item 7a.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
to mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
at december 31, 2014, our long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled $1,192.6 million. we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $446.8 million. we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $745.8 million balance on our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of
december 31, 2014. a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately $3.7 million. however, some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase.
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions, we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures, from an accounting and economic perspective. however, given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged, we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.
we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process. our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency, which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-
measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency. changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at december
31, 2014 and 2013 was $145.7 million and $101.7 million, respectively. our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments, trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.
substantially all of our revenue is transacted in u.s. dollars. however, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies, including japanese yen, euros, malaysian ringgit, philippines peso, singapore dollars, swiss francs, chinese renminbi, and czech koruna. due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies, our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the u.s. dollar. for example, we determined that based on a hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates, our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately
$66.0 million as of december 31, 2014, assuming no offsetting hedge positions.
see note 14: financial instruments of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for further information with respect to our hedging activity.
item 8. financial statements and supplementary data our consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under part iv, item 15(a)(1) of this report and the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under part iv, item 15(a)(2) of this report are filed as part of this report and are incorporated herein by reference in this item 8.
item 9. changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure none.
item 9a. controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) of the exchange act. based upon that evaluation, our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the exchange act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
changes in internal control over financial reporting.
on august 15, 2014, we acquired aptina, which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls. we are separately maintaining aptinas systems and much of its control environment until we are able to incorporate aptinas processes into our own systems and control environment. we currently expect to complete the integration of aptinas operations into our systems and control environment by the end of the year ended december 31, 2015.
on april 30, 2014, we acquired truesense, which operated under its own set of systems and internal controls. we are separately maintaining truesenses control environment until we are able to incorporate truesenses processes into our own control environment. we currently expect to complete the integration of truesenses control environment by the end of the year ended december 31, 2015.
other than as described above, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in exchange act rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2014
which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
managements report on internal control over financial reporting.
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in exchange act rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014.
in making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso) in internal controlintegrated framework 2013. we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2014.
managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31,
2014 excluded aptina, which was acquired by the company on august 15, 2014, and truesense which was acquired on april 30, 2014. total excluded assets of aptina as of december 31, 2014 represent approximately 5% of consolidated assets, and aptinas revenues for the period from august 15, 2014 through december 31, 2014 represents approximately 7% of consolidated revenues. total excluded assets for truesense as of december 31, 2014 represents less than 1% of consolidated assets, and truesense revenues for the period from april 30, 2014 through december 31,
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in part iv, item 15 exhibits and financial statement schedules of this report.

report of independent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors and stockholders of on semiconductor corporation:
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of on semiconductor corporation (the company) and its subsidiaries at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december
31, 2014, based on criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in managements report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 9a. our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
as described in managements report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 9a, management has excluded aptina, inc. (aptina) and truesense imaging, inc. (truesense) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2014 because they were acquired by the company in a purchase business combination during 2014. we have also excluded aptina and truesense from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. aptina and truesense are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets represent
5% and less than 1%, respectively, and total revenues represent 7% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31, 2014.

on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements note 1: background and basis of presentation on semiconductor corporation (on semiconductor), together with its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries (the
company), prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america. as of december 31, 2014, the company was organized into four operating segments, which also represent its four reporting segments: application products group, standard products group, system solutions group, and image sensor group. additional details on our operating segments are included in note 18: segment information.
the company expanded certain prior year amounts in our consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.
revision of previously-issued financial statements during the quarter ended december 31, 2014, the company revised its financial statements for 2013 and 2012 to record a deferred tax asset in a foreign subsidiary and has made adjustments in each successive period related to the foreign currency exchange rate changes associated with that item. the prior periods also include revised amounts from a change in application of an accounting convention, related to manufacturing variances, and other adjustments relating to hedging and inventory amounts. these other previously-identified errors were either uncorrected or corrected in a period subsequent to the period in which the error originated.
the company assessed the effect of the above errors in the aggregate on prior periods financial statements in accordance with the secs staff accounting bulletins no. 99 and 108 and, based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors, determined that the errors were not material to any of the companys prior interim and annual financial statements.
consolidated financial statements, and as such, the company revised its previously-issued consolidated financial statements for 2013 and 2012. the adjustments related to the years prior to fiscal 2012 are reflected as a $43.8
million decrease to the beginning accumulated deficit for fiscal 2012.
all financial information contained in the accompanying notes to these consolidation financial statements has been revised to reflect the correction of these errors.

note 2: significant accounting policies principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company, including its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. investments in companies that represent less than 20% of the related voting stock where the company does not have the ability to exert significant influence are accounted for as cost method investments. all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following: (i)
measurement of valuation allowances relating to trade receivables, inventories and deferred tax assets; (ii)
estimates of future payouts for customer incentives and allowances, warranties, and restructuring activities; (iii)
assumptions surrounding future pension obligations; (iv) fair values of share-based compensation and of financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments); (v) evaluations of uncertain tax positions; (vi)
estimates and assumptions used in connection with business combinations; and (vi) future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, if applicable. actual results could differ from these estimates.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity to the company of three months or less to be cash equivalents. cash and cash equivalents are maintained with reputable major financial institutions.
if, due to current economic conditions, one or more of the financial institutions with which the company maintains deposits fails, the companys cash and cash equivalents may be at risk. deposits with these banks generally exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits; however, these deposits typically may be redeemed upon demand and, as a result of the quality of the respective financial institutions, management believes these deposits bear minimal risk.
short-term investments short-term investments that have an original maturity to the company between three months and one year, and are classified as held-to-maturity. held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost as it is the intent of the company to hold these securities until maturity.
short-term investments also include available-for-sale securities. available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value and the net unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes.
allowance for doubtful accounts in the normal course of business, the company provides non-collateralized credit terms to its customers.
accordingly, the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for possible losses on uncollectible
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued accounts receivable. the company routinely analyzes accounts receivable and considers history, customer creditworthiness, facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances, current economic trends, and payment term changes when evaluating adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. for uncollectible accounts receivable, the company records a loss against the allowance for doubtful accounts only after exhaustive efforts have been made to collect.
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. general market conditions, as well as the companys design activities, can cause certain of its products to become obsolete. the company writes down excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end-user demand. these write downs can influence results from operations. for example, when demand for a given part falls, all or a portion of the related inventory, that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand, is written down, impacting cost of revenues and gross profit.
if demand recovers and the parts previously written down are sold, a higher than normal margin will generally be recognized. however, the majority of product inventory that has been previously written down is ultimately discarded. although the company does sell some products that have previously been written down, such sales have historically been consistently immaterial the related impact on the companys gross profit has also been immaterial.
property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over estimated useful lives of 30-50 years for buildings and 3-20 years for machinery and equipment using straight-line methods. expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations in the period in which the expense is incurred. when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations in the period realized.
the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable. a potential impairment charge is evaluated when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived from an asset group are less than its carrying amount. impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results. judgment is used when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of the asset group.
business combination purchase price allocation the allocation of the purchase price of business combinations is based on management estimates and assumptions, which utilize established valuation techniques appropriate for the high-technology industry. these techniques include the income approach, cost approach or market approach, depending upon which approach is the most appropriate based on the nature and reliability of available data. the income approach is predicated upon the value of the future cash flows that an asset is expected to generate over its economic life. the cost approach takes into account the cost to replace (or reproduce) the asset and the effects on the assets value of physical, functional and/or economic obsolescence that has occurred with respect to the asset. the market approach is used to estimate value from an analysis of actual transactions or offerings for economically comparable assets available as of the valuation date. see note 4: acquisitions for additional information.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the companys acquisitions. see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets and note 4: acquisitions for additional information.
the company evaluates its goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. determining the fair value of the companys reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including projected net cash flows, discount and long-term growth rates. the company determines the fair value of its reporting units based on an income approach, whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows. the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenues, gross profits, operating expenses, and industry trends. the company considers historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and long-term growth rates to use in its analysis. the company considers other valuation methods, such as the cost approach or market approach, if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value. changes in these estimates based on evolving economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods. the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable. actual results may differ from those estimates.
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value.
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing. if the carrying value of the net assets associated with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the company must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. if, during this second step, the company determines that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
the company has determined that its product families, which are components of its operating segments, constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill. the companys product families are one level below its operating segments, with the companys segment management conducting regular reviews of the operating results for each product family. as of each acquisition date, all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition. the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the acquired business included in a reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date.
intangible assets the companys acquisitions have resulted in intangible assets consisting of values assigned to customer relationships; patents; developed technology; iprd; and trademarks. these are stated at cost less accumulated amortization, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the asset group containing these assets may not be recoverable. a potential impairment charge is evaluated when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived from an asset group are less than its carrying amount. impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results. judgment is used when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an asset group. the dynamic economic environment in which the
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued company operates and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of these impairment tests. see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets for additional information.
treasury stock treasury stock is recorded at cost, inclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses, when outstanding common shares are repurchased by the company, including when outstanding shares are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with certain shares pursuant to restricted stock units under the companys share-based compensation plans. see note 9: earnings per share and equity for additional information.
debt issuance costs debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the underlying agreements using the effective interest method and, for the companys convertible notes, are amortized through the first put date, which the company considers to be the earliest maturity date. upon prepayment of debt, the related unamortized debt issuance costs are charged to expense. amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense while the unamortized balance is included in other assets. see note 8: long-term debtloss on debt repurchase or exchange
for additional information.
revenue recognition the company generates revenue from sales of its semiconductor products to oems, electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors. the company also generates revenue, to a much lesser extent, from manufacturing services provided to customers.
the company recognizes revenue on sales to oems, distributors that are not entitled to returns and allowances, electronic manufacturing service providers and on sales of manufacturing services, net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances. revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title and risk of loss pass to the customer (which is generally upon shipment), the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
for products sold to distributors who are entitled to returns and allowances, the company recognizes the related revenue and cost of revenues when it is informed by the distributor that it has resold the products to the end-
user. as a result of the companys inability to reliably estimate up front the effects of the returns and allowances with these distributors, the company defers the related revenue and gross margin on sales to these distributors until it is informed by the distributor that the products have been resold to the end-user, at which time the ultimate sales price in known. although payment terms vary, most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days.
taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue-producing transactions, including value added and excise taxes, are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the statement of operations.
sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience. the companys oem customers do not have the right to return products, other than pursuant to the provisions of the companys standard warranty. sales to distributors, however, are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow-moving products. under the companys general agreements, distributors are allowed to return any product that has been removed from the companys price book. in addition, agreements with distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued however, since the company defers recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product, due to the inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors, sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on the results of operations.
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized; and are netted against revenues. the company reviews warranty and related claims activities and records provisions, as necessary.
the company generally warrants that products sold to its customers will, at the time of shipment, be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to specifications. the companys standard warranty extends for a period that is the greater of (i) two years from the date of shipment or (ii) the period of time specified in the customers standard warranty (provided that the customers standard warranty is stated in writing and extended to purchasers at no additional charge). at the time revenue is recognized, the company establishes an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with its sales, recorded as a component of cost of revenues. in addition, the company also offers cash discounts to certain customers for payments received within an agreed upon time, generally 10 days after shipment. the company records a reserve for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues, based on experience with each customer.
freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense during the period in which they are incurred.
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
share-based compensation share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period. the company has outstanding awards with performance, time and service-based vesting provisions. see note 10: share-based compensation for additional information.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized.
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance, estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies for each taxing jurisdiction are considered. if the company determines it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized, the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense. conversely, if the company determines it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued the company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. the companys practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made, which could have a material impact on the companys effective tax position. see note 15: income taxes for additional information.
foreign currencies most of the companys foreign subsidiaries conduct business primarily in u.s. dollars and, as a result, utilize the dollar as their functional currency. for the remeasurement of financial statements of these subsidiaries, assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are receivable or payable in cash are remeasured at current exchange rates, while inventories and other non-monetary assets in foreign currencies are remeasured at historical rates.
gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of such financial statements are included in the operating results, as are gains and losses incurred on foreign currency transactions.
the companys japanese subsidiaries utilize japanese yen as their functional currency. the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at the average rates in effect for the period. the related translation gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income or loss within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
defined benefit pension plans the company maintains defined benefit pension plans, covering certain of its foreign employees. for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension costs and pension obligations are determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates for plan obligations, assumed rates of return on pension plan assets and assumed rates of compensation increases for employees participating in plans. these assumptions are based upon managements judgment and consultation with actuaries, considering all known trends and uncertainties.
see note 11: employee benefit plans for additional information.
contingencies the company is involved in a variety of legal matters, intellectual property matters, environmental, financing and indemnification contingencies that arise in the normal course of business. based on information available, management evaluates the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and records the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable.
fair value measurement the company measures certain of its financial and non-financial assets at fair value by using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes certain inputs into individual fair value measurement approaches. fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. the fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, as follows:
level 1quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
level 2inputs other than level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and level 3unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
companies may choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected must be reported in earnings. the company has elected not to carry any of its debt instruments at fair value. see note 13: fair value measurements

note 3: recent accounting pronouncements asu no. 2014-09revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09)
in may 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-09, which applies to any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards, superceding the revenue recognition requirements in topic
605. pursuant to asu 2014-09, an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange, as applied through a multi-step process to achieve that core principle. the new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of asu 2014-09 may have on the companys consolidated financial statements.
note 4: acquisitions the company pursues strategic acquisitions from time to time to leverage its existing capabilities and further build its business. such acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations pursuant to asc 805  business combinations. accordingly, acquisition costs are not included as components of consideration transferred, and instead are accounted for as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred. during the year ended december
31, 2014, the company incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $8.1 million, which are included in operating expenses on the companys consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. approximately
$27.0 million for the expensing of the acquisition related inventory fair value adjustment was charged to cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december 31, 2014, when the inventory was sold.
in addition to the acquisitions described below, during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company acquired an additional 10% of the non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary for a purchase price that was greater than its carrying value. the company has reflected the difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the non-controlling interest as additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated statement of shareholders equity for the year ended december 31, 2014. see note 9: earnings per share and equity for additional information.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued acquisition of aptina, inc. (aptina)
on august 15, 2014, the company acquired 100% of aptina for approximately $405.4 million in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, of which approximately $2.9 million remained unpaid as of december 31, 2014. as discussed below, approximately $40.0 million of the total consideration was held in escrow as of december 31, 2014.
during the third quarter of 2014, aptina was incorporated into the companys new image sensor group for reporting purposes. for the period from august 15, 2014 to december 31, 2014, the companys results include approximately
$209.0 million of revenue and a $39.2 million net loss attributable to the acquisition of aptina, which includes
$22.3 million of charges for the amortization of the inventory adjustment to fair market value, $25.5 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and $5.9 million for business combination severance charges. the company expects the acquisition of aptina expands the companys image-sensor business and further strengthens the companys position in the fast growing segment of image sensors in the automotive and industrial end-markets.
the following table presents the initial allocation of the purchase price of aptina for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on august 15, 2014 based on their estimated fair values (in millions):

acquired intangible assets include $51.3 million of iprd assets, which are to be amortized over the useful life upon successful completion of the related projects. the value assigned to iprd was determined by considering the importance of products under development to the overall development plan, reviewing costs incurred for the projects, estimating costs to develop the purchased iprd into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value.
other acquired intangible assets of $206.9 million include: customer relationships of $127.5 million (two to six year useful life); developed technology of $77.1 million (six year useful life); and trademarks of $2.3 million
goodwill of $65.3 million was assigned to the image sensor group. among the factors that contributed to goodwill arising from the acquisition were the potential synergies that are expected to be derived from combining aptina with the companys existing image sensor business. goodwill as of december 31, 2014 is not deductible for tax purposes.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued as of december 31, 2014, management had not yet completed its final evaluation of the fair value of certain intangible and personal property assets acquired. changes related to the fair values during the measurement period may have an impact on the allocation of the purchase price, including values assigned to assets, liabilities and the amount of estimated goodwill represented in the table above.
pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger between the company and the sellers of aptina (the merger agreement), $40.0 million of the total consideration was withheld by the company and placed into an escrow account to secure against certain indemnifiable events described in the merger agreement. the $40.0 million consideration held in escrow was accounted for as restricted cash as of december 31, 2014 and is included in other current assets and accrued expenses on the companys consolidated balance sheet.
acquisition of truesense imaging, inc. (truesense)
on april 30, 2014, the company acquired 100% of truesense for approximately $95.7 million in cash. during the second quarter of 2014, truesense was incorporated into the companys application products group and subsequently migrated to the image sensor group for reporting purposes during the quarter ended september 26, 2014. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company recognized revenue of approximately $53.4 million and a net loss of approximately $0.3 million, attributable to the acquisition of truesense, which includes $4.7 million of charges for the for the inventory adjustment to fair market value, $10.4 million for the amortization of acquired intangible assets the company expects the acquisition of truesense to strengthen the companys product portfolio targeting industrial end-markets such as machine vision, surveillance, and intelligent transportation systems by complementing the companys existing high-speed, high-resolution, power-efficient image sensing solutions with truesenses high-
performance image sensors for low-light, low-noise.

note 5: goodwill and intangible assets goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the companys operating segments. during the first step of the companys annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2013, the company determined that the carrying amount of the companys goodwill for all of its reporting units was recoverable.
during the companys annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2012, the company determined that the fair value of certain of its reporting units were less than the carrying value. as a result of the 2014
impairment analysis, the company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $8.7 million relating to one of its reporting units in the companys application products group operating segment. as a result of the 2012 impairment analysis, the company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14.1 million relating to one of its reporting units in the companys standard products group operating segment.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued the company uses the income approach, based on estimated future cash flows, to perform the goodwill impairment test. these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues, gross profits, operating expenses, and industry trends. the company considers other valuation methods, such as the cost approach or market approach, if it determines that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value. the material assumptions used for the income approach for 2014 and 2013, for reporting units for which no impairment charges were necessary, included projected net cash flows, a weighted-average discount rate of approximately 11%
and 14%, respectively, and a weighted-average long-term growth rate of 3% and 4%, respectively. the company considered historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in the companys analysis.

the number of incremental shares from the assumed exercise of stock options and assumed issuance of shares relating to restricted stock units is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. share-based awards whose impact is considered to be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method were excluded from the diluted net income per share calculation. the excluded number of anti-dilutive share-based awards were approximately 6.1 million, 12.3 million and 15.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the dilutive impact related to the companys 2.625% notes, series b is determined in accordance with the net share settlement requirements prescribed by asc topic 260, earnings per share. under the net share settlement calculation, the companys convertible notes are assumed to be convertible into cash up to the par value, with the excess of par value being convertible into common stock. a dilutive effect occurs when the stock price exceeds the conversion price for each of the convertible notes. in periods when the share price is lower than the conversion price, including 2014, 2013 and 2012, the impact is anti-dilutive and therefore has no impact on the companys earnings per share calculations. see note 8: long-term debt for a discussion of the conversion prices and other features of the 2.625% notes, series b.

at december 31, 2014, total unrecognized estimated share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $2.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. at december 31, 2014, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested restricted stock units with time-based service conditions and performance-based vesting criteria granted prior to that date was $46.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the year ended december 31, 2014 was $10.4 million. the company recorded cash received from the exercise of stock options of $24.9 million and cash from the issuance of shares under the espp of $10.0 million and no related tax benefits during the year ended december 31, 2014. upon option exercise, release of restricted stock units, stock grant awards, or completion of a purchase under the espp, the company issues new shares of common stock.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued share-based compensation information the fair value per unit of each time based and performance based rsu and stock grant award is determined on the grant date and is equal to the companys closing stock price on the grant date. the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model. the lattice-based model uses: (1) a constant volatility; (2) an employee exercise behavior model (based on an analysis of historical exercise behavior); and (3) the treasury yield curve to calculate the fair value of each option grant.
the weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options and the weighted-average assumptions used in the lattice model to calculate the weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows, there were no employee stock options granted during the year ended december 31, 2014 (annualized percentages):
volatility                                                42.8  %                    46.9  %
expected term                                        5.2 years                  5.0 years weighted-average fair value per option    $               2.93       $               3.01
the volatility input is developed using blended volatility. the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding and is computed using the lattice models estimated option fair value as an input to the black-scholes formula and solving for the expected term. the risk-free rate is based on zero-coupon u.s. treasury yields in effect at the date of grant with the same period as the expected term.
share-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest. forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. pre-vesting forfeitures for stock options were estimated to be approximately 11%, 11% and 11% in the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively. pre-vesting forfeitures for restricted stock units were estimated to be approximately 5%, 5%
plan descriptions on february 17, 2000, the company adopted the 2000 stock incentive plan (the 2000 sip) which provided key employees, directors and consultants with various equity-based incentives as described in the plan document. prior to february 17, 2010, stockholders had approved amendments to the 2000 sip which increased the number of shares of the companys common stock reserved and available for grant to 30.5 million, plus an additional number of shares of the companys common stock equal to 3% of the total number of outstanding shares of common stock effective automatically on january 1st of each year beginning january 1, 2005 and ending january 1, 2010. on february 17,
2010, the 2000 sip expired and the company ceased granting under the plan. options granted pursuant to the 2000 sip that remain outstanding continue to be exercisable or subject to vesting pursuant to the underlying option agreements.
on march 23, 2010, the company adopted the amended and restated sip, which was subsequently approved by the companys shareholders at the annual shareholder meeting on may 18, 2010. the amended and restated sip provides key employees, directors and consultants with various equity-based incentives as described in the plan document. the amended and restated sip is administered by the board of directors or a committee thereof, which is authorized to determine, among other things, the key employees, directors or consultants who will receive awards under the plan, the amount and type of award, exercise prices or
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued performance criteria, if applicable, and vesting schedules. on may 15, 2012, shareholders approved certain amendments to the amended and restated sip to increase the number of shares of common stock subject to all awards under the amended and restated sip by 33.0 million to 59.1 million, exclusive of shares of common stock subject to awards that were previously granted pursuant to the 2000 sip that have or will become available for grant pursuant to the amended and restated sip.
generally, the options granted under the 2000 sip and amended and restated sip vest over a period of three to four years and have a term of 10 years and 7 years, respectively. under both plans, certain outstanding options vest automatically upon a change of control, as defined in the respective plan document, provided the option holder is employed by the company on the date of the change in control. certain other outstanding options may also vest upon a change of control if the board of directors of the company, at its discretion, provides for acceleration of the vesting of said options. generally, upon the termination of an option holders employment, all unvested options will immediately terminate and vested options will generally remain exercisable for a period of 90 days after the date of termination (one year in the case of death or disability).
generally, restricted stock units granted under the 2000 sip and the amended and restated sip vest over three to four years or based on the achievement of certain performance criteria and are payable in shares of the companys stock upon vesting.
as of december 31, 2014, there was an aggregate of 35.2 million shares of common stock available for grant under the amended and restated sip.

on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued financing contingencies in the normal course of business, the company provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either the company or its subsidiaries, as required for transactions such as, but not limited to, purchase commitments, agreements to mitigate collection risk, leases, utilities or customs guarantees.
the companys senior revolving credit facility includes $40.0 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit. a $0.2 million letter of credit was outstanding under the senior revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2014. the company also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of its senior revolving credit facility totaling $6.3 million as of december 31, 2014.
as part of obtaining financing in the normal course of business, the company issued guarantees related to certain of its capital lease obligations, equipment financing, lines of credit and real estate mortgages, which totaled approximately $113.3 million as of december 31, 2014. the company is also a guarantor of sci llcs non-
collateralized loan with smbc, which had a balance of $235.9 million as of december 31, 2014. see note 8: long-
term debt for further information with respect to the companys loan with smbc.
based on historical experience and information currently available, the company believes that in the foreseeable future it will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements.
indemnification contingencies the company is a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements. some of the agreements entered into by the company require it to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement, property damage including environmental contamination, personal injury, failure to comply with applicable laws, the companys negligence or willful misconduct, or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets.
the company faces risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that its products fail to perform as expected or such failure of its products results, or is alleged to result, in economic damage, bodily injury, or property damage. in addition, if any of the companys designed products are alleged to be defective, the company may be required to participate in their recall. depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors, the company may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims.
the company and its subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors, officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements, certificates of incorporation, by-laws, articles of association or similar organizational documents, as the case may be. the company maintains directors and officers insurance, which should enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
while the companys future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification, other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of the companys obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. historically, payments made by the company under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on the companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. additionally, the company does not believe that any amounts that it may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to the companys business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued legal matters the company is currently involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. based on information currently available, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material effect on the companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. however, because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation, should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable, the companys business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
on august 22, 2014, collabo innovations, inc. filed a lawsuit in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware against the company and three of its subsidiaries, all of which were acquired in the acquisition of aptina. the complaint alleges infringement of u.s. patent nos. 6,166,405, 7,696,543, 5,976,907, 7,135,725 and
7,023,034 (the collabo patents) and seeks unspecified damages for past infringement. the collabo patents relate to cmos image sensor products. collabo served the complaint on december 18, 2014. the company disputes the claims and will defend the litigation vigorously. based on the limited information currently available, the company is not able to estimate what the possible loss or range of loss might be, if any. the company will pursue its rights under the aptina acquisition agreements to indemnification for losses that may arise out of or result from this matter.
intellectual property matters we face risk to exposure from claims of infringement of the ip rights of others. in the ordinary course of business, we receive letters asserting that our products or components breach another partys rights, including the collabo patents above. these threats may seek that we make royalty payments, that we stop use of such rights, or other remedies.

during the year ended december 31, 2014, one of the the companys previously non-marketable equity securities became marketable due to a change in circumstances that provided it with a readily determinable fair value. the related investment, as accounted for under the cost method, had previously experienced an other-than-temporary impairment and had a zero carrying value. as of december 31, 2014, the related investment was classified as available-for-sale, measured at level 1, with a fair value equal to its carrying value of approximately $4.1
million. the related unrealized gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31, 2014. see note 16: changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss for additional information.
the companys total short-term investments balance was $6.1 million as of december 31, 2014. there were $4.1

the fair value of the companys convertible notes was estimated based on market prices on active markets (level 1).
the fair value of other long-term debt was estimated based on discounting the remaining principal and interest payments using current market rates for similar debt (level 2) at december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued cost method investments investments in equity securities that do not qualify for fair value accounting are accounted for under the cost method. accordingly, the company accounts for investments in companies that it does not control under the cost method, as applicable. if a decline in the fair value of a cost method investment is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and the fair value becomes the new cost basis of the investment. the company evaluates all of its cost method investments for impairment; however, it is not required to determine the fair value of its investment unless impairment indicators are present.
as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the companys cost method investments had a carrying value of approximately $12.2
fair values measured on a non-recurring basis our non-financial assets, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and are remeasured at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. the company uses unobservable inputs to the valuation methodologies that were significant to the fair value measurements, and the valuations require managements judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices. we determine the fair value of our held and used assets, goodwill and intangible assets using an income, cost or market approach as determined reasonable. see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets for a discussion of certain asset impairments.
the following table shows the fair value of certain of the companys non-financial assets included in its consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 that were remeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (in millions):

during the fourth quarter of 2012, the company evaluated the recoverability of the long-lived assets of the system solutions group due to the continued declines in revenue and operating performance. the company revised its long-
term projections related to its system solutions group, including material additional cost reduction efforts and a lower revenue base than previously assumed. as a result, the company recorded an impairment charge of $126.0
million which was comprised of a $94.4 million charge to reduce the carrying value of the associated fixed assets and a $31.6 million charge to reduce the carrying value of the associated intangible assets to their respective fair values. additionally, the company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $14.1 million relating to one of its reporting units during the year ended december 31, 2012. see note 5: goodwill and intangibles assets for additional information.
note 14: financial instruments foreign currencies as a multinational business, the companys transactions are denominated in a variety of currencies. when appropriate, the company uses forward foreign currency contracts to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on its results of operations and cash flows. the companys policy prohibits trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.
the company primarily hedges existing assets and liabilities associated with transactions currently on its balance sheet, which are undesignated hedges for accounting purposes.
at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company had net outstanding foreign exchange contracts with net notional amounts of $145.7 million and $101.7 million, respectively. such contracts were obtained through financial institutions and were scheduled to mature within one to three months from the time of purchase. management believes that these financial instruments should not subject the company to increased risks from foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions to which they are related. the following schedule shows the companys net foreign exchange positions in u.s. dollars as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):
ringgit philippine peso                  16.7                      16.7                  11.7                      11.7
the company is exposed to credit-related losses if counterparties to its foreign exchange contracts fail to perform their obligations. as of december 31, 2014, the counterparties to the companys foreign exchange contracts are held at financial institutions which the company believes to be highly rated and no credit-related losses are anticipated. amounts receivable or payable under the contracts are included in other current assets or
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and
2012, realized and unrealized foreign currency transactions totaled a $3.1 million loss, a $5.5 million gain and a
cash flow hedges the company is exposed to global market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. the company addresses these risks through controlled management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures. the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
the purpose of the companys foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the company from the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from transactions in foreign currencies will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. the company enters into forward contracts that are designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges of selected forecasted payments denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollars. all the contracts mature within
12 months and upon maturity, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified into earnings. the company documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions.
all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date. the total notional amount of outstanding derivatives designated as cash flow hedges as of december
31, 2014 was approximately $79.0 million, which is primarily comprised of cash flow hedges for malaysian ringgit/u.s. dollar and philippine peso/u.s. dollar currency pairs.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, the company recorded a loss of $1.7 million associated with cash flow hedges recognized as a component of cost of revenues. as of december 31, 2014, the company had a $3.5 million liability balance for contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments which were classified as other liabilities. for the year ended december 31, 2013, the company had a $1.8 million liability balance for contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
other at december 31, 2014, the company had no outstanding commodity derivatives, currency swaps or options relating to either its debt instruments or investments. the company does not hedge the value of its equity investments in its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.

on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued a valuation allowance has been recorded against the companys deferred tax assets, with the exception of deferred tax assets at certain foreign subsidiaries, as management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. as of december 31, 2014, the companys deferred tax assets do not include $174.4
million of excess tax deductions from employee stock option exercises that are part of net operating loss carryforwards, which, if realized, will be accounted for as an addition to equity. the company uses the with or without method when determining when excess tax benefits have been realized.
as of december 31, 2014, the companys federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards (nols) were
$1,070.6 million, $997.4 million, and $1,121.9 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2013, the companys federal, state, and foreign nols were $1,101.1 million, $989.7 million, and $1,718.9 million, respectively. if not utilized, these nols will expire in varying amounts from 2015 through 2033. pursuant to sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code, the utilization of nols and other tax attributes may be subject to substantial limitations if certain ownership changes occur during a three-year testing period (as defined by the internal revenue code).
during 2006, such an ownership change occurred, limiting the use of federal nols to approximately $93.1 million per year. as of december 31, 2014, the company had federal, state, and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $177.8
this income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 consisted of the reversal of $23.3 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets as a result of a net deferred tax liability recorded as part of the truesense acquisition and the reversal of $4.6 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during the year ended december 31, 2014. this is partially offset by $19.8 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations, $4.6 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions, and $3.3 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill.
the 2013 provision of $16.4 million included $22.2 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of the companys foreign operations and $0.9 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions and $2.7 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill.
this is partially offset by the reversal of $6.0 million of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and the reversal of $3.4 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2013.
the 2012 provision of $16.0 million included $21.7 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of the companys foreign operations and $0.9 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions. this is partially offset by $7.8 million of additional tax benefit recorded and the reversal of $1.4 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdiction which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2012.
income taxes have not been provided on approximately $1,784.1 million of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries over which the company has sufficient influence to control the distribution at december 31, 2014. the company has determined that substantially all such earnings have been reinvested indefinitely. these earnings could become subject to either or both federal income tax and foreign withholding tax if they are remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings are loaned to any of our domestic companies, or if the company sells its investment in certain subsidiaries. the company estimates that repatriation of these foreign earnings would generate additional taxes of approximately $178.7 million after net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits.
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued the company files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal, state and local, or non-u.s. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010.
the company maintains liabilities for uncertain tax positions. these liabilities involve considerable judgment and estimation and are continuously monitored by management based on the best information available, including changes in tax regulations, the outcome of relevant court cases, and other information. the company is currently under examination by various taxing authorities. although the outcome of any tax audit is uncertain, the company believes that it has adequately provided in its consolidated financial statements for any additional taxes that the company may be required to pay as a result of such examinations. if the payment ultimately proves not to be necessary, the reversal of these tax liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period the company determines such liabilities are no longer necessary. however, if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds the companys estimate of tax liabilities, additional tax expense will be recorded. the impact of such adjustments could have a material impact on the companys results of operations in future periods.
the activity for unrecognized gross tax benefits for 2014, 2013, and 2012 (in millions) is as follows:

included in the december 31, 2014 balance of $31.2 million is $13.4 million related to unrecognized tax positions that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate. of the total $31.2 million balance of unrecognized tax benefit at december 31, 2014, $1.8 million is related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could significantly change during the 12 months following december 31, 2014, as a result of expiring statutes of limitations.
the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued in relation to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. the company recognized approximately $0.5 million of expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014, and recognized approximately $0.5 million and $0.2 million of expenses during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the company had approximately $3.2 million, $3.6 million, and $3.0 million of accrued interest and penalties at december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

note 18: segment information as of december 31, 2014, the company was organized into four operating segments, consisting of the application products group, standard products group, system solutions group and image sensor group. the companys image sensor group was established during the third quarter of 2014, and includes the companys
on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued recent image sensor business acquisition of aptina along with the companys pre-existing image sensor business units (including truesense) which were previously reported as part of the application products group. see note 4:
acquisitions for additional information with respect to the companys recent acquisitions. previously reported information has been recast to reflect the current reportable segments.
each of the companys major product lines has been examined and each product line has been assigned to a reportable segment, as illustrated in the table below, based on the companys operating strategy. because many products are sold into different end-markets, the total revenue reported for a segment is not indicative of actual sales in the end-market associated with that segment, but rather is the sum of the revenue from the product lines assigned to that segment. these segments represent the companys view of the business and as such are used to evaluate progress of major initiatives and allocation of resources.

on semiconductor corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statementscontinued the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. the company evaluates performance-based on segment revenues and gross profit.
the companys wafer manufacturing facilities fabricate ics for all business units, as necessary, and their operating costs are reflected in the segments cost of revenues on the basis of product costs. because operating segments are generally defined by the products they design and sell, they do not make sales to each other. the company does not discretely allocate assets to its operating segments, nor does management evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information.
in addition to the operating and reporting segments mentioned above, the company also operates global operations, sales and marketing, information systems, finance and administration groups that are led by vice presidents who report to the chief executive officer. a portion of the expenses of these groups are allocated to the segments based on specific and general criteria and are included in the segment results reported below. the company does not allocate income taxes or interest expense to its operating segments as the operating segments are principally evaluated on gross profit. additionally, restructuring, asset impairments and other, net and certain other manufacturing and operating expenses, which include corporate research and development costs, unallocated inventory reserves and miscellaneous nonrecurring expenses, are not allocated to any segment.

item 7.    managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited historical consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this form 10-k. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains statements that are forward-looking. these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors. actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in part 1, item 1a risk factors included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
executive overview this executive overview presents summary information regarding our industry, markets, business and operating trends only. for further information relating to the information summarized herein, see part ii, item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in its entirety.
industry overview according to wsts (an industry research firm), worldwide semiconductor industry sales were $335.8 billion in 2014, an increase of approximately 9.9% from $305.6 billion in 2013. we participate in unit and revenue surveys and use data summarized by wsts to evaluate overall semiconductor market trends and also to track our progress against the market in the areas we provide semiconductor components. the following table sets forth total worldwide semiconductor industry revenues and revenues in our serviceable addressable market (sam) since 2010:
year ended december 31,               worldwide      percentage                  serviceable      percentage semiconductor          change           addressable market          change industry sales (1)                                sales (1) (2)
(1)                                    based on shipment information published by wsts. wsts collects this information based on product shipments, which differs from how we recognize revenue on shipments to certain distributors as described in note 2: significant accounting policiesrevenue recognition in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report. we believe the data provided by wsts is reliable, but we have not independently verified it. wsts periodically revises its information. we assume no obligation to update such information.
(2)                                                our sam comprises the following specific wsts product categories: (a) discrete products (all discrete semiconductors other than sensors, microwave power transistors/modules, microwave diodes, and microwave transistors, power modules, logic and optoelectronics); (b) standard analog products (amplifiers, vregs and references, comparators, assp consumer, assp communications, assp computer, assp automotive and assp industrial and others); (c) standard logic products (general purpose logic); (d) standard product logic (consumer other, computer other peripherals, wired / wireless communications, automotive, industrial and multipurpose); (e) cmos and ccd image sensors; (f) memory; (g) microcontrollers and (h) motor control modules. our sam is derived using the most recent information available at the time of the filing of each respective periods annual report and is revised in subsequent periods to reflect final results.
worldwide semiconductor industry sales grew 31.8% in 2010, grew 0.4% in 2011, declined 2.6% in 2012, grew 4.8% in 2013, and grew 9.9% in 2014 following a pattern associated with the financial crisis, subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty. the increase of 9.9% from 2013 to 2014 is related to improved global macroeconomic conditions within the semiconductor industry affecting sales in all geographic regions.
sales in our sam increased to $110.2 billion in 2010, decreased to $107.4 billion in 2011, decreased to $103.7 billion in 2012, increased to $104.3 billion in 2013 and increased to $112 billion in 2014. the increase of approximately 7.4% from $104.3 billion in 2013 to $112 billion in 2014 is consistent with the trend in the worldwide semiconductor market. the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our sam of approximately 3% for the next three years. these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results.
recent results our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2014 were $3,161.8 million, an increase of approximately 14% from $2,782.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the majority of the increase was attributable to our acquisitions of aptina and truesense, along with other increases in our application products group and standard products group, partially offset by decreased revenue from our system solutions group. during 2014, we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor corporation of $189.7 million compared to net income attributable to on semiconductor corporation of $150.4 million in 2013. our gross margin increased by approximately 90 basis points to 34.3% in 2014 from 33.4% in 2013, primarily driven by changes in volume and mix across certain of our product lines.
during 2014, the majority of our restructuring and cost saving initiatives were focused on our system solutions group, which included certain voluntary retirement programs and the planned closure of our kss facility.
for further information with respect to our restructuring activity, including our other restructuring and cost savings programs initiated during 2014, see note 6: restructuring, asset impairments, and other, net of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report.
business overview we are driving innovation in energy efficient electronics. our extensive portfolio of analog, digital and mixed signal ics, standard products, image sensors and custom devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in advanced electronic systems and products. our power management and motor driver semiconductor components control, convert, protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices. our custom asics use analog, dsp, mixed-signal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive, medical, military/aerospace, consumer and industrial customers products. our signal management semiconductor components provide high-performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing, communications and industrial systems. our image sensors, optical image stabilization and auto focus devices provide advanced imaging solutions for automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications. our standard semiconductor components serve as building blocks within virtually all types of electronic devices. these various products fall into the logic, analog, discrete, image sensors and memory categories used by the wsts group.
our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in product areas that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications. we collaborate with our customers to identify desired innovations in electronic systems in each end-market that we serve. this enables us to participate in the fastest growing sectors of the market. we also innovate in advanced packaging technologies to support ongoing size reduction in electronic systems and in advanced thermal packaging to support high performance power conversion applications. it is our practice to regularly re-evaluate our research and development spending, to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies. we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to position ourselves for continued growth. we seek to maximize the investment of our people and capital in research and development by targeting innovative products and solutions for high growth
applications that position the company to outperform the industry. our design expertise in analog, digital, mixed signal and imaging ics, combined with our extensive portfolio of standard products enable the company to offer comprehensive, value added solutions to our global customers for their electronics systems.
historically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical. during a down cycle, unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem, resulting in revenue declines. in response to such declines, manufacturers have reduced or shut down production capacity. when new applications or other factors have caused demand to strengthen, production volumes have historically stabilized and then grown again. as market unit demand reaches levels above capacity production capabilities, shortages begin to occur, which typically causes pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers, thus prompting further capacity expansion. such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand, which has triggered another similar cycle.
business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities we have recognized efficiencies from implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure. however, the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. while there have been recent indications of improving conditions, our business environment continues to experience significant uncertainty and volatility. we have historically reviewed, and will continue to review, our cost structure, capital investments and other expenditures to align our spending and capacity with our current sales and manufacturing projections.
we have historically taken significant actions to align our overall cost structure with our expected revenue levels. such actions continued in 2014 within our system solutions group. see results of operations under the heading restructuring, asset impairments and other, net below, along with note 6: restructuring, asset impairments and other, net of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for further details relating to our most recent cost saving actions.
outlook on semiconductor q1 2015 outlook based upon product booking trends, backlog levels, and estimated turns levels, we estimate that our revenues will be approximately $840 million to $880 million in the first quarter of 2015. backlog levels for the first quarter of 2015 represent approximately 80% to 85% of our anticipated first quarter 2015 revenues. we estimate average selling prices for the first quarter of 2015 will be down approximately two percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. for the first quarter of 2015, we estimate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be approximately 33.4% to 35.4%.
results of operations our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 include the operations of our acquisitions of aptina and truesense on august 15, 2014 and april 30, 2014, respectively.
revision of previously-issued financial statements during the quarter ended december 31, 2014, we revised our financial statements for 2013 and 2012 to record a deferred tax asset in a foreign subsidiary and have made adjustments in each successive period related to the foreign currency exchange rate changes associated with that item. the prior periods also include revised amounts from a change in application of an accounting convention, related to manufacturing variances, and other adjustments relating to hedging and inventory amounts. these other previously-identified errors were either uncorrected or corrected in a period subsequent to the period in which the error originated.
we assessed the effect of the above errors in the aggregate on prior periods financial statements in accordance with the secs staff accounting bulletins no. 99 and 108 and, based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors, determined that the errors were not material to any of our prior interim and annual financial statements.
all financial information contained herein has been revised to reflect the correction of these errors. see note 1: background and basis of presentation of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.
operating results the following table summarizes certain information relating to our operating results that has been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):

revenues revenues were $3,161.8 million, $2,782.7 million and $2,894.9 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase from 2013 to 2014 was primarily attributed to approximately $262.4 million of additional revenue in the image sensor group provided by the acquisitions of aptina and truesense, along with increases from our application products group and standard products group, which experienced greater revenue as a result of an improved demand environment. the increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased revenue from our system solutions group.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, we experienced a decline in average selling prices of approximately 5%, as compared to 2013, offset by favorable changes in volume and mix, which resulted in a net increase in revenue of approximately 14%.
the decrease in revenues from 2012 to 2013 was the result of decreased revenue in our system solutions group from a weakened demand environment associated with a further softening of the japanese consumer market and a devalued yen, which was partially offset by increased revenue from our other reportable segments.
revenues by reportable segment for each of the three years below, were as follows (dollars in millions):
application products group           $1,070.4            33.9   %             $996.8            35.8   %             $969.6            33.5   %
revenues from the application products group revenues from the application products group increased by $73.6 million, or approximately 7%, from 2013 to 2014 and increased from 2012 to 2013 by $27.2 million or approximately 3%.
this increase in 2014 is primarily attributable to revenue provided by the 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense, which generated approximately $262.4 million, of revenue during 2014. revenues from our existing image sensor business units also increased during 2014.
the 2014 decrease resulted from a decrease in demand from the japanese consumer market and an increase in competition in other regions, causing a decrease in revenue from lsi products of approximately $53.8 million, or approximately 13.0%.
the 2013 decrease resulted from a softening of the japanese consumer market, a devalued yen, and, to a lesser extent, political tensions between japan and china.
revenues by geographic location revenues by geographic location, including local sales made by operations within each area, based on sales billed from the respective country, are summarized as follows (in millions):
united states             $497.0          15.7   %            $415.4            14.9   %            $452.0            15.6   %
united kingdom             497.9          15.7   %             400.2            14.4   %             388.3            13.4   %
for additional information, see the table of revenues by geographic location included in note 18: segment information of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
gross profit and gross margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below)
our gross profit by reportable segment in each of the three years below was as follows (dollars in millions):
application products group               $475.0                44.4   %             $431.0                43.2   %             $430.3                44.4   %
gross profit by segment                $1,114.6                                     $949.7                                   $1,003.2
unallocated manufacturing (1)             (29.7   )            (0.9   )%             (20.6   )            (0.7   )%             (56.9   )            (2.0   )%
total gross profit                     $1,084.9                34.3   %             $929.1                33.4   %              946.3                32.7   %
(1)   unallocated manufacturing costs are being shown as a percentage of total revenue.
our gross profit was $1,084.9 million, $929.1 million and $946.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the gross profit increase of $155.8 million, or approximately 17%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily attributable to increased revenues, along with increased capacity utilization and cost savings realized from previous restructuring activities, partially offset by decreased average selling prices and approximately $27.0 million for the expensing of the fair market value of inventory step-up from our recent acquisitions for the year ended december 31, 2014.
the gross profit decrease from 2012 to 2013 is primarily attributable to decreases in gross profit in our system solution group as a result of lower revenues for the year ended december 31, 2013 as well as smaller decreases in gross profit from our other operating segments.
gross margin increased to approximately 34.3% during 2014 compared to approximately 33.4% during 2013. this increase was primarily driven by favorable changes in volume and mix across certain product lines as well as a larger proportion of revenues generated from our applications products group, image sensor group and standard products group which experienced higher gross margin levels than our system solutions group.
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenues from 2012 to 2013 was primarily driven by changes in volume and mix across certain product lines.
operating expenses research and development research and development expenses were $366.6 million, $334.2 million and $367.5 million, representing approximately 11.6%, 12.0% and 12.7% of revenues for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the increase in research and development expenses of $32.4 million, or approximately 10%, from 2013 to 2014 is primarily associated with approximately $38.0 million of expenses attributable to our 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense. these expenses were further increased by greater personnel costs in our application products group and standard products group, along with increased performance-based compensation as a result of improved performance results for 2014 compared to 2013, partially offset by decreases in our system solutions group attributable to decreased payroll related expenses resulting from our restructuring and cost saving activities.
the decrease in research and development expenses from 2012 to 2013 was primarily associated with decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group, along with the impact of a devalued yen.
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were $200.0 million, $171.2 million and $180.9 million, representing approximately 6.3%, 6.2% and 6.2% of revenues, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the increase in selling and marketing expenses of $28.8 million, or approximately 17%, from 2013 to 2014 is primarily associated with approximately $11.2 million of expenses attributable to our 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense, along with increased sales commissions and increased payroll related expenses associated with performance-based compensation as a result of improved performance results for 2014 compared to 2013.
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group, along with the impact of a devalued yen.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were $180.9 million, $148.5 million and $160.6 million, representing approximately 5.7%, 5.3% and 5.5% of revenues, for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the increase in general and administrative expenses of $32.4 million, or approximatively 22%, from 2013 to 2014 is primarily associated with approximately $9.6 million of expenses attributable to our 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense, along with increased payroll related expenses associated with performance-based compensation as a result of improved performance results for 2014 compared to 2013, in addition to approximately $8.1 million in third-party acquisition-related expenses.
the decrease in general and administrative expenses from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to decreased payroll and related expenses resulting from our 2012 and 2013 restructuring and cost saving activities in our system solutions group, along with the impact of a devalued yen.
amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $68.4 million, $33.1 million and $44.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase of $35.3 million from 2013 to 2014 is attributable to the amortization of intangible assets assumed as a result of our acquisitions of aptina and truesense. see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
the decrease in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributed to the impairment of certain of the system solutions groups intangible assets recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012. see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
restructuring, asset impairments and other, net restructuring, asset impairments and other, net was $30.5 million, $33.2 million and $163.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the information below summarizes the major
activities in each year. for additional information, see note 6: restructuring, asset impairments and other, net of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, we initiated a voluntary retirement program for employees of certain of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan (the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program). approximately 350 employees opted to retire under the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, of which all employees had exited by december 31, 2014. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized approximately $10.4 million of employee separation charges related to the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program.
in connection with the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, approximately 70 contractor positions were also identified for elimination, all of which all had exited by the end of 2014. during the year ended december 31, 2014, an additional 40 positions were identified for elimination, as an extension of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, consisting of 20 employees and 20 contractors, substantially all of which had exited by december 31, 2014.
as a result of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, we recognized a pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees of $4.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014, which is recorded in restructuring, asset impairments and other, net. see note 11: employee benefit plans of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we initiated further voluntary retirement activities applicable to an additional 60 to 70 positions, for certain of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan, consisting of employees and contractors. substantially all personnel had exited under this program by december 31, 2014. we anticipate total cost savings for the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, which includes the above headcounts, to be between the range of our previously disclosed expectations of $36 million to $45 million during the first year following the completion of the anticipated headcount reductions.
on october 6, 2013, we announced a plan to close kss (the kss plan). pursuant to the kss plan, a majority of the production from kss was transferred to other of our manufacturing facilities. the kss plan includes the elimination of approximately 170 full time and 40 contract employees. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded approximately $7.8 million of employee separation charges and $2.3 million of exit costs related to the kss plan.
as a result of the kss facility closure, we recognized a $2.1 million pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees during the year ended december 31, 2014, which is recorded in restructuring, asset impairments and other, net. see note 11: employee benefit plans of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we initiated two voluntary retirement programs for certain employees of our system solutions group subsidiaries in japan. approximately 500 employees opted to retire pursuant to the first program, and substantially all employees had retired by december 31, 2013. approximately 170 employees had retired by december 31, 2013 under the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program. as part of these restructuring activities, approximately half of the 70 contractor positions identified for elimination were terminated by the end of 2013.
we recorded net charges of approximately $37.3 million in connection with these programs, consisting of employee severance charges of $52.9 million, partially offset by pension and related retirement liability adjustments associated with the affected employees, which resulted in a pension curtailment benefit of $15.6 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we recorded $3.1 million of restructuring charges related to the announced closure of our aizu facility. we also released approximately $21.0 million of associated cumulative foreign currency translation gains related to our subsidiary that owned the aizu facility, which utilized the japanese yen as its functional currency. the related amount was recorded as a benefit to restructuring, asset impairments and other, net on the our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. for additional information, see note 16: changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
we recorded approximately $10.0 million of net restructuring charges related to the kss plan during the year ended december 31, 2013, consisting of employee severance charges of $6.5 million and $3.5 million of asset impairment charges associated with the kss plan.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we initiated a voluntary retirement program for certain employees of our system solutions group and certain of its subsidiaries. we recorded net charges of approximately $35.9 million associated with this program, consisting of employee severance charges of $47.6 million, partially offset by $11.7 million attributed to pension plan curtailment gains.
additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2012, we executed a global workforce reduction program. restructuring expenses resulting from this program consisted primarily of $11.2 million associated with employee severance charges.
we incurred additional charges related to the closure of certain of our facilities during 2012.
indefinite and long-lived asset impairment charges
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we determined that approximately $8.7 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to one of our reporting units in the application products group was impaired resulting from a decline in estimated future cash flows. in connection with this impairment, we wrote-off approximately $0.9 million of intangible assets and $4.7 million of other long-lived assets. see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we evaluated the current period operating results of the system solutions group and re-assessed future projections for the segment. as a result, we determined that $94.4 million of carrying value for certain long-lived assets associated with the system solutions group and $31.6 million of related intangible assets were impaired. for additional information, see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we further determined that approximately $14.1 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to our 2008 acquisition of catalyst was impaired resulting from a strategic decision to invest in other business units and the resulting decline in estimated future cash flows. as part of our annual goodwill testing, it was determined that certain intangible assets associated with the standard products group were impaired. in connection with this impairment, we wrote-off approximately $3.8 million of intangible assets. these goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were recognized in our standard products group segment. see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
other income and expenses interest expense interest expense decreased by $4.5 million from $38.6 million in 2013 to $34.1 million in 2014. additionally, interest expense decreased by $17.5 million from $56.1 million in 2012 to $38.6 million in 2013. we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of $7.0 million, $11.2 million and $23.4 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our average long-term debt balance (including current maturities and net of debt discount) during 2014, 2013 and 2012, was $1,067.4 million, $977.1 million and $1,109.5 million, respectively. our weighted average interest rate on long-term debt (including current maturities and net of debt discount) was approximately 3.2%, 3.9% and 5.1% per annum in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. see liquidity and capital resourceskey financing and capital events below for a description of our refinancing activities.
other other income decreased by $5.9 million from a gain of $1.5 million in 2013 to a loss of $4.4 million in 2014. other income decreased by $4.3 million from a gain of $5.8 million in 2012 to a gain of $1.5 million in 2013. the change from year to year is largely attributable to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the dollar for the periods presented, net of the impact from our hedging activity.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, we exchanged $60.0 million in principal value ($57.4 million of carrying value) of our 2.625% notes for $58.5 million in principal value of our 2.625% notes, series b, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2.625% notes, resulting in a loss on debt repurchase of $3.1 million. subject to certain other terms and conditions, this transaction extended the earliest put date for the exchanged amount from december 2013 to december 2016.
see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we exchanged $99.9 million in par value ($92.8 million of carrying value) of our 2.625% notes for $99.9 million in par value of 2.625% notes, series b and $2.0 million in cash, which resulted in a loss on debt exchange of $7.8 million. subject to certain other terms and conditions, this exchange extended the first put date of the underlying notes, which we consider to be the earliest maturity date, from december 2013 to december 2016. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of $0.2 million and a provision of $16.4 million and $16.0 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2014 consisted of the reversal of $23.3 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets as a result of a net deferred tax liability recorded as part of the truesense acquisition and the reversal of $4.6 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during the year ended december 31, 2014. this is partially offset by $19.8 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations, $4.6 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions, and $3.3 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill.
the 2013 provision of $16.4 million included $22.2 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations and $0.9 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions and $2.7 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill. this is partially offset by the reversal of $6.0 million of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and the reversal of $3.4 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2013.
the 2012 provision of $16.0 million included $21.7 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign operations, $2.6 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill, and $0.9 million of interest on existing reserves for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions. this is partially offset by $7.8 million of additional tax benefit recorded and the reversal of $1.4 million for reserves and interest for potential liabilities in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2012.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates. our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was a benefit of 0.1%, which differs from the u.s. statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries. our effective tax rate was also lower than the u.s. statutory federal income tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 and december 31, 2012 , due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries. we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on all of our domestic and japan related deferred tax assets; however, it is reasonably possible that a substantial portion of the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets will be reversed within one year of december 31, 2014, which is not expected to have a material effect on the companys cash taxes. as of december 31, 2014, the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets was approximately $461.9 million.
income taxes have not been provided on approximately $1,784.1 million of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2014 over which we have sufficient influence to control the distribution of such earnings and have determined that substantially all such earnings have been reinvested indefinitely. these earnings could become subject to either or both federal income tax and foreign withholding tax if they are remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings are loaned to any of our domestic companies, or if we sell our investment in certain subsidiaries. we estimate that repatriation of these foreign earnings would generate additional taxes of approximately $178.7 million after the assumed utilization of our available net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits.

liquidity and capital resources this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements, off-balance sheet arrangements, contingencies, sources and uses of cash, operations, working capital, and long-term assets and liabilities.
contractual obligations our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our long-term debt, capital leases, operating leases and purchase obligations. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31, 2014 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future (in millions):
payments due by period contractual obligations (1)                                                  total      2015               2016               2017               2018               2019                   thereafter long-term debt, excluding capital leases (2)                              $1,235.1             $215.1             $436.1              $59.3             $489.8            $34.8                    $

(1)   the table above excludes approximately $16.0 million of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement of such liabilities.
(3)   these represent our off-balance sheet arrangements (see liquidity and capital resourcesoff-balance sheet arrangements for a description of our off-balance sheet arrangements).
this table also excludes our pension obligations. we expect to make cash contributions and future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements of approximately $8.5 million in 2015. this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements. the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. beyond 2015, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. see note 11: employee benefit plans of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for more information on our pension obligations.
our balance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $517.8 million at december 31, 2014. we believe that our cash flows from operations, coupled with our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments at december 31, 2014 include approximately $203.6 million available in the united states. in addition to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments already on hand in the united states, we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states by settling loans with our foreign subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs, by utilizing existing credit facilities or through new bank loans or debt obligations.
we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states. we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements, common stock and debt repurchases, payments and acquisitions. if we are unable to address our u.s. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current debt agreements or other sources of cash obtained
at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
see note 8: long-term debt, of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term debt.
see part ii, item 5 market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities included elsewhere in this report for a discussion of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and our stock repurchase activities.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business, we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system, desktop computers, communications, foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment.
in the normal course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us, as required for transactions including, but not limited to: material purchase commitments; agreements to mitigate collection risk; leases; utilities; and customs guarantees. our senior revolving credit facility includes $40.0 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit. a $0.2 million letter of credit was outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2014. we also had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our senior revolving credit facility of $6.3 million at december 31, 2014.
as part of securing financing in the normal course of business, we issued guarantees related to our capital lease obligations, equipment financing, lines of credit and real estate mortgages, which totaled approximately $113.3 million as of december 31, 2014. we are also a guarantor of sci llcs non-collateralized loan with smbc, which had a balance of $235.9 million as of december 31, 2014. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
based on historical experience and information currently available, we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements.
for our operating leases, we expect to make cash payments and incur similar expenses totaling $103.6 million as payments come due. we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases, letters of credit and guarantee arrangements. see note 12: commitments and contingencies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
contingencies we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements. some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement, property damage including environmental contamination, personal injury, failure to comply with applicable laws, our negligence or willful misconduct, or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets.
we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in economic damages, bodily injury or property damage. in addition, if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective, we may be
required to participate in their recall. depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors, we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims.
we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors, officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements, certificates of incorporation, by-laws, articles of association or similar organizational documents, as the case may be. we maintain directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification, other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. historically, payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
see part i, item 3 legal proceedings and note 12: commitments and contingencies of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for possible contingencies related to legal matters. see also part i, item 1 businessgovernment regulation for information on certain environmental matters.
sources and uses of cash we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for research and development, to make capital expenditures, for strategic acquisitions and investments, to repurchase our common stock and other company securities, and to pay debt service, including principal and interest and capital lease payments. our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances. in the near term, we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand, including short-term investments.
as part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis. on august 15, 2014, we completed the purchase of aptina, for a total purchase price of approximately $405.4 million in cash, of which approximately $2.9 million remained unpaid and approximately $40.0 million was held in escrow as of december 31, 2014. on april 30, 2014, we completed the purchase of truesense, for a total purchase price of approximately $95.7 million in cash. see note 4: acquisitions of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include:
                                                    factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows, including the impact on our business and operations as a result of changes in demand for our products, competitive pricing pressures, effective management of our manufacturing capacity, our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses, the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business; and
                                                     factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise, including interest rate fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing, and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time.
our ability to service our long-term debt, including our 2.625% notes, series b, to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital, capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to, among other things, our future operating performance, as well as to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control.
if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives. there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or, if available, will be at rates or prices acceptable to us. we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs, as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements, through at least the next twelve months. to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans, our liquidity may be adversely impacted.
during the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures for inventory, operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand. during 2014, we paid $204.3 million for capital expenditures, while in 2013 we paid $155.2 million. our current projection for capital expenditures in 2015 is approximately $250 million to $270 million, of which our current minimum commitment is approximately $38.5 million. the capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives.
on october 10, 2013, we entered into an $800.0 million, five-year senior revolving credit facility. the new credit agreement amended and restated our prior agreement dated as of december 23, 2011 and significantly increased our liquidity as described under key financing and capital events2013 financing eventsamended and restated senior revolving credit facility. we borrowed approximately $350.0 million of the $800.0 million available under the new facility. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
on december 1, 2014, we announced a capital allocation policy (the capital allocation policy) under which we intend to return approximately 80 percent of free cash flow less repayments of long-term debt to shareholders, subject to a variety of factors, including our strategic plans, market and economic conditions and the boards discretion. for the purposes of the capital allocation policy, we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. we also announced the 2014 share repurchase program pursuant to the capital allocation policy. under the 2014 share repurchase program, we intend to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our common shares over a four year period, subject to the same factors and considerations described above. the 2014 share repurchase program was effective december 1, 2014, and the $300 million 2012 stock repurchase program was terminated on that date. see part ii, item 5. market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information with respect to our share repurchase programs.
cash management our ability to manage cash is limited, as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements, contractual obligations, debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements. while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases, we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products.
primary cash flow sources our long-term cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash. our cash flows from operations is summarized as follows (in millions):
for the year ended december 31,
summarized cash flow from operating activities net income (loss)                                                                            $192.1                $153.6                 $(92.9   )

our cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased by approximately $154.0 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase is primarily attributable to higher net sales, cost savings realized from our previously enacted restructuring programs and lower cash outflows from our restructuring activities.
our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on, among other factors, our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets.
our management of our assets and liabilities, including both working capital and long-term assets and liabilities, also influences our operating cash flows, and each of these components is discussed below.
working capital working capital, calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities, fluctuates depending on end-market demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables, inventory and payables. in times of escalating demand, our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production. our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs, which may require us to use cash for severance payments, asset transfers and contract termination costs. in addition, our working capital may be affected by acquisitions, capital activities as part of our share repurchase programs and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments. our working capital, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, was $765.0 million at december 31, 2014 and has fluctuated between $913.1 million and $743.5 million over the last eight quarter-ends. although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances, these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our working capital was most
significantly impacted by our capital expenditures, the acquisition of aptina and truesense, the repurchase of our common stock and the payments associated with our restructuring activities. see note 8: long-term debt, note 6: restructuring, asset impairments, and other, net and note 9: earnings per share and equityof the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
long-term assets and liabilities our long-term assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.
our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently. we believe that near-term access to additional manufacturing capacity, should it be required, could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties. we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity.
our long-term liabilities, excluding long-term debt, consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves. in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans, generally, our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate. this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions. for additional information, see note 11: employee benefit plans of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k and see note 15: income taxes of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
key financing and capital events overview for the past several years, we have undertaken various measures to repurchase shares of our common stock, reduce our long-term debt, reduce related interest costs and, in some cases, extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility. certain of these measures continued in 2014. set forth below is a summary of certain key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years. for further discussion of our debt instruments see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
2014 financing events share repurchase program during the year ended december 31, 2014, we purchased approximately 13.9 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $121.0 million, exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses, at a weighted-average execution price of $8.71 per share. see part ii, item 5. market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information. see also see note 9: earnings per share and equity of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements under the heading equityshare repurchase program included elsewhere in this form 10-k for information on the share repurchase programs.
amounts drawn on amended and restated senior revolving credit facility during the third quarter of 2014, we drew an incremental amount of approximately $230.0 million to partially fund the purchase of aptina. the outstanding balance of the facility as of december 31, 2014 was $350.0 million. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
2013 financing events share repurchase program during the year ended december 31, 2013, we purchased approximately 13.9 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $101.3 million, exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses, at a weighted-average execution price per share of $7.29. see note 9: earnings per share and equity of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements under the heading equityshare repurchase program included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information on the share repurchase program.
convertible note exchange during the year ended december 31, 2013, we exchanged $60.0 million in principal value ($57.4 million of carrying value) of our 2.625% notes for $58.5 million in principal value of our 2.625% notes, series b, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2.625% notes, resulting in a loss on debt repurchase of $3.1 million. subject to certain other terms and conditions, this exchange extended the earliest put date for the exchanged amount from december 2013 to december 2016. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information. this exchange, along with the exchange in 2012 described below, was based on the exemption from registration in section 3(a)(9) of the securities act of 1933, as amended.
retirement of 1.875% and 2.625% notes on january 28, 2013, we settled the conversion obligation on the outstanding 1.875% notes by delivering approximately $77.5 million in cash to the holders who tendered their 1.875% notes for conversion. the excess $4.1 million over the $73.4 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the 1.875% notes was attributable to the conversion feature for the 1.875% notes. the settlement of the conversion obligation on january 28, 2013 resulted in the retirement of our obligation under the 1.875% notes.
on december 20, 2013, we exercised our option to redeem all of our outstanding 2.625% notes. as a result, we paid the gross principal amount of $72.6 million to the holders of the 2.625% notes and retired the outstanding obligation.
note payable to smbc on january 31, 2013, we amended and restated our seven-year non-collateralized loan obligation with sanyo electric. in connection with the amendment and restatement of the loan agreement, sanyo electric assigned all of its rights under the loan agreement to smbc.
see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
amended and restated senior revolving credit facility on october 10, 2013, we entered into an $800 million, five-year senior revolving credit facility (the facility), the terms of which are set forth in an amended and restated credit agreement dated as of october 10, 2013 (the credit agreement). the facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, stock repurchase, and/or acquisitions. the increase in amount of the facility further enhances our profile and provides financial flexibility to support long-term business and financial objectives. following entry into the credit agreement, we borrowed $120 million of the $800 million available under the facility. the facility includes $40 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit, $15 million of availability for swingline loans for short-term borrowings and a foreign currency sublimit of $75 million. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
2012 financing events share repurchase program during the year ended december 31, 2012, we purchased approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock under a share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $55.3 million, exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses, at a weighted-average price per share of $6.26. see note 9: earnings per share and equity under the heading equityshare repurchase program of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
convertible note exchange during the year ended december 31, 2012, we exchanged $99.9 million in par value ($92.8 million of carrying value) of our 2.625% notes for $99.9 million in par value of our 2.625% notes, series b and $2.0 million in cash, resulting in a loss on debt repurchase of $7.8 million, which included the write-off of $0.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. subject to certain other terms and conditions, this exchange extended the earliest put date for the exchanged amount from december 2013 to december 2016. see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
redemption of 1.875% notes during the year ended december 31, 2012, we redeemed approximately $21.6 million in aggregate principal value of our 1.875% notes for approximately $21.6 million in cash.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, we exercised a call option relating to our zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2024. as a result, we paid the aggregate principal amount of $96.2 million to the holders of the notes and retired the outstanding obligation.
debt guarantees and related covenants our 2.625% notes, series b are subordinated to the senior indebtedness of on semiconductor corporation and its guarantor subsidiaries, as defined in note 20: guarantor and non-guarantor statements of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k, on the terms described in the indentures for such notes. as of december 31, 2014, we believe that we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our 2.625% notes, series b and with covenants relating to our senior revolving credit facility and various other debt agreements.
see note 8: long-term debt of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements.
use of estimates. the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following: (i) measurement of valuation allowances relating to trade receivables, inventories and deferred tax assets; (ii) estimates of future payouts for customer incentives and allowances, warranties, and restructuring activities; (iii) assumptions surrounding future pension obligations; (iv) fair values of share-based compensation and of financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments); (v) evaluations of uncertain tax positions; (vi) estimates and assumptions used in connection with business combinations; and (vi) future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, if applicable. actual results could differ from these estimates.
revenue. we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems, electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors. we also generate revenue, although to a much lesser extent, from manufacturing services provided to customers. distributor revenue is recognized in various ways within the industry, dependent on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement with distributors. some entities recognize revenue upon sale to the distributor, while others, like us, recognize revenue when the sale is made to the end customer, where the facts and circumstances of the distributor arrangements allow for such recognition. additionally, there can often be a lag in the data collection from distributors, which may have an effect on our revenue recognition. due to our high distributor sales, revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy.
we recognize revenue on sales to oems, distributors that are not entitled to returns and allowances, and electronic manufacturing service providers, net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances, when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title and risk of loss pass to the customer (which is generally upon shipment), the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
for products sold to distributors who are entitled to returns and allowances, we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues when we are informed by the distributor that it has resold the products to the end-user. as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effects of the returns and allowances with these distributors, we defer the related revenue and gross margin on sales to these distributors until we are informed by the distributor that the products have been resold to the end-user, at which point the ultimate sales price is known. although payment terms vary, most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days.
taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue-producing transactions, including value added and excise taxes, are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the statement of operations.
sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience. our oem customers do not have the right to return our products, other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty. sales to distributors, however, are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow-moving products. under our general agreements, distributors are allowed to return any product that we have removed from our price book. in addition, agreements with our distributors typically contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. however, since we defer recognition of revenue and gross profit on sales to distributors until the distributor resells the product due to our inability to reliably estimate up front the effect of the returns and allowances with these distributors, sales returns and allowances have minimal impact on our results of operations. provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized, and are netted against revenues. we review warranty and related claims activity and record provisions, as necessary.
we generally warrant that products sold to our customers will, at the time of shipment be free from defects in workmanship and materials and conform to our specifications. subject to certain exceptions, our standard warranty extends for a period of two years. at the time revenue is recognized, we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with our sales, recorded as a component of cost of revenues. in addition, we also offer cash discounts to certain customers for payments received by us within an agreed upon time, generally 10 days after shipment. we accrue reserves for cash discounts as a reduction to accounts receivable and a reduction to revenues, based on experience with each customer.
freight and handling costs are included in the cost of revenues and are recognized as period expenses during the period in which they are incurred.
inventories. we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or market and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end-user demand. these provisions can influence our results from operations. for example, when demand falls for a given part, all or a portion of the related inventory which is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved, impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit. if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold, we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin. however, the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded. although we do sell some products that have previously been written down, such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material.
deferred tax valuation allowance. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. in determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. conversely, if we determine that we will more likely than not be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense. we maintain a valuation allowance for our domestic deferred tax assets and most of our foreign deferred tax assets.
impairment of long-lived assets. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable. impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount. impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results. we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group. the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests. in recent years, most of our asset groups that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned, sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities. in some instances, these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value with related gains recorded in the restructuring, asset impairment and other, net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements.
goodwill. we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows, discount and long-term growth rates. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows. estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments. the assumptions about future conditions include factors such as future revenues, gross profits, operating expenses, and industry trends. changes in these estimates based on evolving economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods. we consider other valuation methods, such as the cost approach or market approach, if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. actual future results may differ from those estimates. we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analysis.
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. if the carrying value of the net assets associate with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. if, during this second step, we determine that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
we have determined that our product families, which are components of our operating segments, constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill. our product families are one level below the operating segments, constituting individual businesses with our segment management conducting regular reviews of the operating results for each product family. as of each acquisition date, all goodwill acquired was assigned to the product families that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the respective acquisition. the amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit was the difference between the fair value of the acquired business included in a reporting unit and the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit as of the acquisition date.
our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2015; however, identification of a triggering event may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods.
defined benefit pension plans and related benefits. we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our non-u.s. employees. for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension costs and estimated withdrawal liabilities are determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates for plan obligations, assumed rates of return on pension plan assets and assumed rates of compensation increase for employees participating in the plans. these assumptions are based upon managements judgment and consultation with actuaries, considering all known trends and uncertainties. actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans. as of december 31, 2014, a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately $35.0 million.
contingencies. we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. based on the available information, we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable.

item 7a.    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. to mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
at december 31, 2014, our long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled $1,192.6 million. we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $446.8 million. we do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $745.8 million balance on our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of
december 31, 2014. a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately $3.7 million. however, some of this impact would be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase.
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions, we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures, from an accounting and economic perspective. however, given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged, we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.
we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process. our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency, which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency. changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts at december 31, 2014 and 2013 was $145.7 million and $101.7 million, respectively. our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments, trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.
substantially all of our revenue is transacted in u.s. dollars. however, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies, including japanese yen, euros, malaysian ringgit, philippines peso, singapore dollars, swiss francs, chinese renminbi, and czech koruna. due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies, our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the u.s. dollar. for example, we determined that based on a hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates, our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately $66.0 million as of december 31, 2014, assuming no offsetting hedge positions.
see note 14: financial instruments of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for further information with respect to our hedging activity.

item 1a. risk factors general references to "eqr" mean equity residential, a maryland real estate investment trust ("reit"), and references to "erpop" mean erp operating limited partnership, an illinois limited partnership. unless otherwise indicated, when used in this section, the terms "company," "we," "us" or "our" mean collectively eqr, erpop and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by eqr and/or erpop and the term "operating partnership" means collectively erpop and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by erpop. this item 1a. includes forward-looking statements. you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements included in item 7.
the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect, possibly in a material manner, our business, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest (which we refer to collectively as "shares"), preference units, op units, restricted units (formerly known as long-term incentive plan ("ltip") units) and our public unsecured debt. in this section, we refer to the shares, preference units, op units, restricted units and public unsecured debt together as our "securities" and the investors who own such securities as our "security holders".
our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.
general real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid. numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value. these factors include changes in the global, national, regional and local economic climates, local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties, the attractiveness of our properties to residents, competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes and changes in market rental rates. our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance, insurance and other operating costs, including real estate taxes, all of which could increase over time. these operating expenses could rise faster than our revenues causing our income to decline. sources of labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated. also, the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property.
we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire.
when our residents decide to leave our apartments, whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date, we may not be able to relet their apartment units. even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units, the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms. if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units, or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates, then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. if residents do not experience increases in their income, we may be unable to increase rent and/or delinquencies may increase. occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing, increasing portions of single family housing stock being converted to rental use, rental housing subsidized by the government, other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing, governmental regulations, slow or negative employment growth and household formation, the availability of low-interest mortgages or the availability of mortgages requiring little or no down payment for single family home buyers, changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond the company's control. in addition, various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents. finally, the federal government's policies, many of which may encourage home ownership, can increase competition and possibly limit our ability to raise rents. consequently, our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced.
the retail/commercial space at our properties primarily serves as an additional amenity for our residents. the long term nature of our retail/commercial leases (generally five to ten years with market based renewal options) and the characteristics of many of our tenants (generally small, local businesses) may subject us to certain risks. we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or for market rates. also, when leases for our existing retail/commercial space expire, the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the current lease terms. our properties compete with other properties with retail/commercial space. the presence
of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. if our retail/commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy, they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. the revenues from our retail/commercial space represent approximately 4% of our total rental income.
we have increased our concentration of properties in certain core markets, which could have an adverse effect on our operations if a particular market is adversely affected by economic or other conditions.
we have increased our concentration of properties in certain core markets as a result of our strategy to reposition our portfolio from low barrier to entry/non-core markets to high barrier to entry/core markets. if any one or more of our core markets (boston, new york, washington d.c., southern california, san francisco, seattle, south florida and denver) is adversely affected by local or regional economic conditions (such as business layoffs, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors) or local real estate conditions (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for multifamily properties), such conditions may have an increased adverse impact on our results of operations than if our portfolio was more geographically diverse.
because real estate investments are illiquid, we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate.
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly. we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions. this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders.
new acquisitions, development projects and/or rehabs may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties.
we intend to actively acquire, develop and rehab multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate. we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up. we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule, resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues and/or lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions or higher than expected operating expenses. we may not be able to achieve rents that are consistent with expectations for acquired, developed or rehabbed properties. we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position, to complete a development property or to complete a rehab. additionally, we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts. this competition (or lack thereof) may increase (or depress) prices for multifamily properties. we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios, that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. the total number of apartment units under development, costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation.
in connection with such government regulation, we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act, the fair housing act or other federal, state or local requirements. noncompliance could result in fines, subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance.
development and construction risks could affect our profitability.
we intend to continue to develop multifamily properties. these activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities, including significant environmental remediation or construction work in high-density urban areas. we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs, and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities. the occupancy rates and rents at a property may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing properties. we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities.
our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority regarding major decisions, our reliance on our joint venture partners' financial condition, any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners.
we currently do and may continue in the future to develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures. a portion of the assets acquired in the archstone transaction were acquired through joint ventures with avb that neither we nor avb control solely. we have several joint ventures with other real estate investors. joint venture investments, including the joint ventures with avb, involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties, including the following:
•   our joint venture partners might experience financial distress, become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, which may delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture;
•   we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses;
•   our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to a property that conflict with our business interests and goals, which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership, management or disposition of the property;
•   we may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority over major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and any property owned by the joint venture, such as the sale or financing of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property;
•   our joint venture partners may take actions that we oppose;
•   our ability to sell or transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted without prior consent of our joint venture partners;
•   we may disagree with our joint venture partners about decisions affecting a property or the joint venture, which could result in litigation or arbitration that increases our expenses, distracts our officers and disrupts the day-to-day operations of the property, including by delaying important decisions until the dispute is resolved; and
•   we may suffer losses as a result of actions taken by our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments.
at times we have entered into agreements providing for joint and several liability with our partners. frequently, we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners' interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate and recognize attractive returns on our joint venture investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and distributions to our shareholders.
several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction along with certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures with avb as part of the archstone transaction are subject to tax protection agreements, which could limit our flexibility with respect to our ownership of such assets or cause us to incur material costs.
several of the assets we acquired in the archstone transaction were contributed to archstone subject to various agreements limiting the ability of the owner of the property to take actions that would trigger income tax liability for the contributing owner of the property, including a taxable disposition of the property. in addition, we will also be required to maintain a certain amount of qualified nonrecourse financing on the tax protected properties during their respective restricted periods. our obligations relating to the tax protected properties may affect the way in which we conduct our business, including whether, when and under what circumstances we sell properties or interests therein and the timing and nature of our financings and refinancing transactions. as a result, we may not be able to dispose of or refinance the tax protected properties when to do so may have otherwise been favorable to us and our shareholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. certain preferred interests acquired in joint ventures with avb as part of the archstone transaction have complex tax requirements that, if violated, may cause us to be required to indemnify the preferred stockholders for certain tax protection costs.
changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.
the stock markets, including the new york stock exchange, on which we list our common shares, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over time. as a result, the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our
operating performance or prospects. the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including but not limited to the following:
•   general market and economic conditions;
•   changes in our funds from operations, normalized funds from operations or earnings estimates;
•   difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance debt;
•   large portfolio acquisitions or dispositions;
•   decreasing (or uncertainty in) real estate valuations;
•   rising crime rates in markets where our increasingly urban portfolio is concentrated;
•   a change in analyst and/or credit ratings;
•   adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future;
•   governmental regulatory action, including changes or proposed changes to the mandates of fannie mae or freddie mac, and changes in tax laws;
•   the issuance of additional common shares, or the perception that such issuances might occur, including under eqr's atm program; and
•   the resale of substantial amounts of our common shares, or the anticipation of the resale of such shares, by large holders of our securities.
we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions.
we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders. however, there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions, which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions and/or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference. should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels. while our current dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute, it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate. see item 7 for additional discussion regarding our dividend policy.
the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company.
from time to time, the company holds investment securities and/or cash investments that have various levels of repayment and liquidity risk, including government obligations and bond funds, money market funds or bank deposits. on occasion we also may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds. there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities, which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank substantially exceeds the fdic insurance limit or we invest cash in money market or similar type funds with investment management institutions that may be subject to, now or in the future, liquidity restrictions, resulting in risk to the company of loss or lack of immediate availability of funds if these banks or institutions fail to meet their obligations.
any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price.
section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price.
the occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our reputation and business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.
a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. more specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information, including information regarding our residents and employees. as our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced to third party service providers. in addition, information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. our primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our reputation, damage to our business relationships with our residents/tenants and private data exposure. we have implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.
changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business.
we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any real estate or other federal, state or local taxes. consequently, any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders.
we may become involved in legal proceedings, including but not limited to, proceedings related to consumer, shareholder, employment, environmental, development, condominium conversion, tort and commercial legal issues that, if decided adversely to or settled by us, could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations.
environmental problems are possible and can be costly.
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property. the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. these laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. in addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site.
substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies. while these environmental assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future.
we are aware that some of our properties have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those properties. while we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our properties, there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future.
there have been a number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property, should mold become an issue in the future, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.
we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties.
climate change to the extent that climate change does occur, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. should the impact of climate change be material in nature, including destruction of our properties, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.
in addition, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.
insurance policy deductibles, exclusions and counterparties as of december 31, 2014, the company's property insurance policies provide for a per occurrence deductible of $250,000. any earthquake and named windstorm losses in critical areas are subject to a deductible of 5% of the values of the buildings involved in the losses. the company also typically self-insures a substantial portion of the first $50 million of a property loss in excess of these base deductibles. should a claim exceed these amounts, it would be 100% covered by insurance. furthermore, the company purchased additional coverage in the event that the company suffers multiple non-catastrophic occurrences with losses from $25 million to $50 million within the same policy year. the company's general liability and worker's compensation policies at december 31, 2014 provide for a $2.0 million and $1.0 million per occurrence deductible, respectively. these higher deductible and self-insured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential for uninsured losses. the company also has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio, becoming more concentrated in fewer, more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint. furthermore, the potential impact of climate change, increased severe weather or earthquakes could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in the availability of coverage, either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
the company also has $750.0 million in terrorism insurance coverage, with a $100,000 deductible. this coverage excludes losses from nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties, we could lose the revenues from the property, our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses.
as of december 31, 2014, the company's cyber liability insurance policy provides for a $5.0 million general limit and a per occurrence deductible of $250,000. cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release, through inadvertent breach or network attack, of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers. this cyber policy would cover the cost of victim notification, credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses.
the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property, general liability and worker's compensation insurance. while there has yet to be any non-performance by these major insurance providers, should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress, it could negatively impact the company. in addition, the company annually assesses its insurance needs based on the cost of coverage and other factors. we may choose to self insure a greater portion of this risk in the future or may choose to have higher deductibles or lesser policy terms.
the inability of lehman to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us under the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction could increase our liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
in addition to certain indemnification obligations of each party to the purchase agreement for the archstone transaction relating to breaches of fundamental representations and warranties and breaches of covenants and certain other specified matters, we negotiated as a term in the purchase agreement that lehman retain responsibility for and indemnify us against damages resulting from certain third-party claims or other liabilities. these third-party claims and other liabilities include, without limitation, costs associated with various litigation matters. lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in september 2008 and is currently in the process of post-petition liquidation. if lehman completes its liquidation prior to the termination of their indemnity obligations to us under the purchase agreement, or otherwise distributes substantially all of its assets to its creditors prior to such time, lehman may not be able to satisfy its obligations with respect to claims and retained liabilities covered by the purchase agreement. the failure of lehman to satisfy such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition because claimants may successfully assert that we are liable for those claims and/or retained liabilities. in addition, we expect that certain obligations of lehman to indemnify us will terminate upon expiration of the applicable indemnification period (generally no more than three years following the closing). the assertion of third-party
claims after the expiration of the applicable indemnification period, or the failure of lehman to satisfy its indemnification obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
non-performance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance.
we have relationships with and, from time to time, we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties. as a result, defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided, or volatility in the financial markets could affect counterparties' ability to complete transactions with us as intended, both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
debt financing and preferred shares/preference units could adversely affect our performance.
general please refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for the company's total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december 31, 2014.
in addition to debt, we have a liquidation value of $50.0 million of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest/preference units with a dividend preference of 8.29% per annum as of december 31, 2014. our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks, including the following:
disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions.
dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets, resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us and/or the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited, or be available only on unattractive terms, we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments. in addition, it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt and/or react to changing economic and business conditions. uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing. potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate significantly and/or to decline.
potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance.
there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac (the "government sponsored enterprises" or "gses"). through their lender originator networks, the gses are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the company's properties. the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities. any changes to their mandates, further reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have a significant impact on the company and may, among other things, lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings. the gse's regulator has set overall volume limits on most of the lending activities of the gses. for 2015, these activities are generally consistent with historical requirements and are not anticipated to materially impact the gses' overall multifamily lending activity. however, going forward the regulator could require the gses to focus more of their lending activities on small borrowers or properties that the regulator deems affordable, which may or may not include the company's assets. disruptions in the floating rate tax-exempt bond market (where interest rates reset weekly) and in the credit market's perception of the gses, which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds, have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations. these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations. while this obligation is in almost all cases non-recourse to us, this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets.
non-performance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance.
although we have not experienced any material counterparty non-performance, disruptions in financial and credit markets could, among other things, impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations. there are multiple
financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility. should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required, our financial condition could be adversely affected. should several of these institutions fail to fund, we could experience significant financial distress.
the company also has developed assets with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change. if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required, the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties.
a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance.
a significant downgrade in our credit ratings, while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility, would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the revolving credit facility, impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt, impair our ability to access the commercial paper market or otherwise limit our access to capital. in addition, a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral and/or letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our self-insured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders' requirements at the lower ratings level.
scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition.
in the future, our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels.
we may not be able to refinance existing debt, including joint venture indebtedness (which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity) and, if we can, the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced, extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions, such as new equity capital, our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt. as a result, certain of our other debt may cross default, we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties, we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property. foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
please refer to item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for the company's debt maturity schedule as of december 31, 2014.
financial covenants could adversely affect the company's financial condition.
the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that, among other things, limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage. in addition, our unsecured credit facility contains certain restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt. the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt (including acquisition financing), and to sell all or substantially all of our assets. our credit facility and indentures are cross-defaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt. while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, should it fall out of compliance, it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
some of the properties were financed with tax-exempt bonds or otherwise contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions, including affordability requirements. the company, and from time to time its consultants, monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties. if these compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderate-income residents, or eligible/qualified residents, then our income from these properties may be limited. while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with tax-exempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions, this may not always be the case. some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities.
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing.
our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders. for example, the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes, making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general. our consolidated debt-to-total market capitalization ratio was 28.5% as of december 31, 2014. in addition, our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows:
total debt to adjusted total assets (not to exceed 60%)            39.2        %          40.0        %
secured debt to adjusted total assets (not to exceed 40%)          18.4        %          19.2        %
consolidated income available for debt service to maximum annual service charges
total unsecured assets to unsecured debt
advances under our credit facility bears interest at a variable rate based upon libor at various interest periods, plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership's credit rating, or based upon bids received from the lending group. certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also, from time to time, bear interest at floating rates or be swapped to a floating rate of interest. we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future. increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders.
derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow.
in the normal course of business, we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments, including hedging for future debt issuances. at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates. we may also use derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates or manage commodity prices in the daily operations of our business. there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact. these arrangements, which can include a number of counterparties, may expose us to additional risks, including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts, and may involve extensive costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate them. no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate, foreign exchange or commodity pricing fluctuations.
we depend on our key personnel.
we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees, samuel zell, and our executive officers, particularly david j. neithercut, our president and chief executive officer ("ceo"). if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us, our operations could be temporarily adversely affected. mr. zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company.
control and influence by significant security holders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other security holders.
the consent of certain affiliates of mr. zell is required for certain amendments to the sixth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership (the "partnership agreement"). as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement, the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company. although to the company's knowledge these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter, they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company's affairs if they were to act together in the future. this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders. for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees, including mr. zell, and our executive officers, see equity residential's definitive proxy statement.
shareholders' ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited.
provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control.
certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the then-prevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders. this includes the 5% ownership limit described below. while our existing preferred shares/preference units do not have these provisions, any future series of preferred shares/preference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders. our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder, or persons acting in concert with such security holder, who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders, including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities. these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders.
we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes.
to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year. to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification, our declaration of trust, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than 5% of the lesser of the number or value of any outstanding class of common or preferred shares. we refer to this restriction as the "ownership limit." absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees, securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the security holder's rights to distributions and to vote would terminate. a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit. the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our security holders' ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their shares. to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an anti-takeover device, the company's ownership limit requires, rather than permits, the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company's status as a reit. we have issued several of these waivers in the past.
our preferred shares may affect changes in control.
our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to 100 million preferred shares, and to establish the preferences and rights (including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares) of any preferred shares issued. the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders.
inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control.
certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit "business combinations" (including certain issuances of equity securities) with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities, or with an affiliate who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company's outstanding voting securities (an "interested shareholder"), or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder. these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder. after the five-year period, a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two super-majority shareholder votes unless, among other conditions, holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares. as permitted by maryland law, however, the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr. zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them. consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us and/or any of them. such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders.
our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements.
our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders.
we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december 31, 1992 based, in part, upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions. we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit. many of these requirements,
however, are highly technical and complex. we cannot, therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify as a reit in the future. the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control. for example, to qualify as a reit, our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws. we are also required to distribute to security holders at least 90% of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains. the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements. even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status; however, the reit qualification rules permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status. there is also risk that congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a reit. we do not believe, however, that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status.
if we fail to qualify as a reit, we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. also, unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit. if we fail to qualify as a reit, we would have to pay significant income taxes. we therefore would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders. this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities. in addition, we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders. even if we qualify as a reit, we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. in addition, various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income.
we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits.
if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence, then they might have had undistributed "subchapter c corporation earnings and profits" at the time of their merger with us. if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place, we might not qualify as a reit. we believe, based in part upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations, among other things, that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that, in any event, none of them had any undistributed "subchapter c corporation earnings and profits" at the time of their merger with us. if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit, an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us. we would be liable for the tax on such gain. we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger.
compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition.
distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company.
we may be required from time to time, under certain circumstances, to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received. in such event, or upon our repayment of principal on debt, we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit. accordingly, we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements.
tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company.
in past years we have made, and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future, a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year. this election, which is provided for in the internal revenue code, may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year. however, this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability.
federal income tax considerations general the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares. it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. for example, it does not give a detailed discussion of any state, local or foreign tax considerations. the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders
in light of their particular circumstances. moreover, it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws, such as insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers, foreign corporations, persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flow-through entity for federal income tax purposes.
the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase, ownership and disposition of common shares. therefore, it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder's personal tax situation, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.
the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code, current, temporary and proposed treasury regulations, the legislative history of the internal revenue code, current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service, including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings, which are not binding on the internal revenue service, and existing court decisions. future legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law. any change could apply retroactively. thus, it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion, which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts, and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service.
our taxation we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december 31, 1992. in any year in which we qualify as a reit, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders. this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations, which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive. we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries engaged in activities which cannot be performed directly by a reit, such as condominium conversion and sale activities. as a result, we will be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income generated by these activities in our taxable reit subsidiaries.
we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements. we could also be subject to the "alternative minimum tax" on our items of tax preference. in addition, any net income from "prohibited transactions" (i.e., dispositions of property, other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business) will be subject to a 100% tax. we could also be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service. if we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (described below) but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements, we will still generally be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure. if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests (described below) by more than a de minimis amount, due to reasonable cause, and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions, we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets. if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit (other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below) and the violation is due to reasonable cause, we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. moreover, we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate.
we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with 1992. we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit. however, given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements, we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year.
if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply, we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. we also may be subject to the corporate "alternative minimum tax." as a result, our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders. unless entitled to statutory relief, we would not be able to re-elect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification. it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief.
our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code. we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results. accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit.
ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us. the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a "taxable reit subsidiary" or "trs", provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed 25% of the reit's total asset value. trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular "c" corporation that have elected, jointly with a reit, to be a trs. generally, a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services (discussed below), which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests. however, the reit will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us, our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties. a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the 100% federal income tax liability imposed on reits. income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land, the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units.
trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates. the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount. the trss will attempt to reduce, if possible, the amount of these taxes, but we cannot guarantee whether, or the extent to which, measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful. to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes, less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders.
share ownership test and organizational requirement. in order to qualify as a reit, our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a taxable year that is 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. also, not more than 50% in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year. in addition, we must meet certain other organizational requirements, including, but not limited to, that (i) the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and (ii) we are managed by one or more trustees. we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future. in order to ensure compliance with the 100 person test and the 50% share ownership test discussed above, we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership. however, such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements, and thereby failing to qualify as a reit.
gross income tests. to qualify as a reit, we must satisfy two gross income tests:
(1)   at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year must generally be derived directly or indirectly from rents from real property, interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of non-dealer real property and shares of reit stock, dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments (excluding certain hedging income).
(2)   at least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year must generally be derived from sources qualifying under the 75% test described in (1) above, non-reit dividends, non-real estate mortgage interest and gain from the sale or disposition of non-reit stock or securities (excluding certain hedging income).
to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests, rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident. also, the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed 15% of the total rent. we may generally provide services to residents without "tainting" our rental income only if such services are "usually or customarily rendered" in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered "impermissible services". if such services are impermissible, then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount, or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements, or through a taxable reit subsidiary. we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible, or, if considered impermissible services, will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary. however, we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions.
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code. in this case, a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above. generally, it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply, we will not qualify as a reit.
asset tests. in general, on the last day of each quarter of our taxable year, we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets:
(1)   at least 75% of the value of our total assets must consist of real estate assets (which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts) and certain cash related items;
(2)   not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may consist of securities other than those in the 75% asset class;
(3)   except for securities included in item 1 above, equity investments in other reits, qualified reit subsidiaries (i.e., corporations owned 100% by a reit that are not trss or reits), or taxable reit subsidiaries: (a) the value of any one issuer's securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and (b) we may not own securities representing more than 10% of the voting power or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer; and
(4)   not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may consist of securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries.
the 10% value test described in clause (3)(b) above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code. under the safe harbor, the following are not considered "securities" held by us for purposes of this 10% value test: (i) straight debt securities, (ii) any loan of an individual or an estate, (iii) certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property, (iv) any obligation to pay rents from real property, (v) any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof, foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity, or (vi) any security issued by a reit. the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that (a) such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity, not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of 1⁄4 of 1% or 5% of the annual yield to maturity or we own $1,000,000 or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer's debt and not more than 12 months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or (b) the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt. if we hold indebtedness from any issuer, including a reit, the indebtedness will be subject to, and may cause a violation of, the asset tests, unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor. we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded. if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit, we would not meet the 10% voting stock limitation and the 10% value limitation and we would, unless certain relief provisions applied, fail to qualify as a reit. we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification. however, we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations.
if we fail to satisfy the 5% or 10% asset tests described above after a 30-day cure period provided in the internal revenue code, we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our non-qualifying assets is de minimis (i.e., does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or $10,000,000) and we dispose of the non-qualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered. for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above, we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests, after the 30-day cure period, by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period, paying a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service. if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions, or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests, we would cease to qualify as a reit.
annual distribution requirements. to qualify as a reit, we are generally required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to 90% of our reit taxable income. these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made. we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements. to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our reit taxable income, as adjusted, we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates. we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of: (1) 85% of our reit ordinary income for the year; (2) 95% of our reit capital gain net income for the year; and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years. a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains. in that case, a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as long-term capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit. for purposes of the 4% excise tax described above, any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed.
ownership of partnership interests by us. as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership, we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership, respectively, for purposes of the reit asset and income tests, including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies.
state and local taxes. we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business or reside. generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years. our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above. consequently, prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares.
taxation of domestic shareholders subject to u.s. tax general. if we qualify as a reit, distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares, other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries, will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits. these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute "qualified dividend income" under the internal revenue code, meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements. in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits, we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares. the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs, will be designated as "qualified dividend income" to reit shareholders. these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our non-corporate shareholders.
to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits, such distributions will be considered a return of capital. such distributions will be treated as a tax-free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder's common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated. to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder's tax basis, such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares. shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses.
dividends declared by a reit in october, november, or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december 31 of that year, so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year. however, this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit's earnings and profits existing on december 31. to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december 31, the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid. as such, for tax reporting purposes, january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years.
distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year. this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year. it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares. despite this general rule, corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income.
generally, our designated capital gain dividends will be broken out into net capital gains distributions (which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 20% for individual taxpayers in the highest tax bracket) and unrecaptured section 1250 gain distributions (which are taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals, estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 25%).
certain u.s. shareholders that are taxed as individuals, estates or trusts may also be required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other things, dividends on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares.
if, for any taxable year, we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest, then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction. the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year. the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest.
we may elect to retain (rather than distribute as is generally required) net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain. if we make this election, shareholders must include in income, as long-term capital gain, their proportionate
share of the undistributed net capital gain. shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains. accordingly, they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount. shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid. our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately.
in general, a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between:
(a)   the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition; and
the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset. generally, the capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year.
in general, a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less, determined after applying certain holding period rules, will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as long-term capital gains. for shareholders who are individuals, trusts and estates, the long-term capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable long-term capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated.
taxation of domestic tax-exempt shareholders most tax-exempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income, which is often referred to as ubti. unless a tax-exempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business, distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti. similarly, if a tax-exempt shareholder sells common shares, the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business.
however, for tax-exempt shareholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, and qualified group legal services plans, income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares. these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code.
in addition, certain pension trusts that own more than 10% of a "pension-held reit" must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti. we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pension-held reit for purposes of this rule.
taxation of foreign shareholders the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder. for purposes of this discussion, a "foreign shareholder" is any person other than:
(a)   a citizen or resident of the united states;
(b)   a corporation or partnership created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof; or
(c)   an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of its source.
distributions by us. distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits. these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a 30% rate, or a lower treaty rate, unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business. please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits. dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates, and are generally not subject to withholding. certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt
from withholding under this exemption. a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a lower treaty rate.
we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of 30% on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless:
(a)   a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us; or
(b)   the foreign shareholder files an irs form w-8eci with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income.
if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder's common shares. instead, the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares. to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares, it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder's common shares. the tax treatment of this gain is described below.
we intend to withhold at a rate of 30%, or a lower applicable treaty rate, on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution. in such event, a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our earnings and profits, and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder's united states tax liability with respect to the distribution.
any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is "regularly traded" on an established securities market, will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above, if the foreign shareholder did not own more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution. foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report such distributions received from us on u.s. federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for u.s. federal income tax purposes, including any capital gain dividends, will be subject to a 30% u.s. withholding tax (unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty), as described above. in addition, the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions.
distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends, other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest, generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless:
(a)   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder's united states trade or business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders, except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax, as discussed above; or
(b)   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a "tax home" in the united states, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual's capital gains.
under the foreign investment in real property tax act, which is known as firpta, distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business. this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend. accordingly, foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to u.s. shareholders, subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. in addition, a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above, as well as u.s. federal income tax return filing requirements. we are required to withhold 35% of these distributions. the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder's united states federal income tax liability.
although the law is not entirely clear on the matter, it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by u.s. shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends. under that approach, foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains. in addition, if timely requested, foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability.
foreign shareholders' sales of common shares. gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a "united states real property interest" within the meaning of firpta. the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit. a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders. we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit. therefore, we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta. however, because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit. in any event, gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to u.s. tax, if either:
(a)   the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder's united states trade or business, in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain; or
(b)   the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual's capital gains.
even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit, gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if:
(a)   the class or series of shares being sold is "regularly traded," as defined by applicable irs regulations, on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange; and
(b)   the selling foreign shareholder owned 5% or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange.
if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta, the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable u.s. shareholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax, a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations. the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs 10% of the purchase price.
information reporting requirement and backup withholding we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld, if any. under certain circumstances, domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding. backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service. backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and tax-exempt organizations. domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. backup withholding is not an additional tax. rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person's united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service.
withholding on foreign financial institutions and non-u.s. shareholders the foreign account tax compliance act ("fatca") is contained in sections 1471 through 1474 of the internal revenue code (and the treasury regulations thereunder) and was originally enacted in 2010 as part of the hiring incentives to restore employment act. fatca will impose a u.s. withholding tax at a 30% rate on dividends paid after june 30, 2014 and on proceeds from the sale of our shares paid after december 31, 2016 to "foreign financial institutions" (as defined under fatca) and certain other foreign entities if certain due diligence and disclosure requirements related to u.s. accounts with, or ownership of, such entities are not satisfied or an exemption does not apply. if fatca withholding is imposed, non-u.s. beneficial owners that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from, or a reduction of, u.s. withholding tax with respect to such distributions and sale proceeds would be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. any payment made by us that is subject to withholding under fatca or otherwise will be net of the amount required to be withheld.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company and the operating partnership should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. due to the company's ability to control the operating partnership and its subsidiaries, the operating partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the company for financial reporting purposes, except for three unconsolidated operating properties and our military housing properties. capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2014.
forward-looking statements forward-looking statements in this item 7 as well as elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are based on current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions made by management. while the company's management believes the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information is inherently subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks, which could cause actual results, performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. many of these uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and beyond management's control. forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, results or events. the forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof and the company undertakes no obligation to update or supplement these forward-looking statements. factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to the following:
▪   we intend to actively acquire, develop and rehab multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate. we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up. we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule, resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues and/or lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions or higher than expected operating expenses. we may not be able to achieve rents that are consistent with expectations for acquired, developed or rehabbed properties. we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position, to complete a development property or to complete a rehab. additionally, we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts. this competition (or lack thereof) may increase (or depress) prices for multifamily properties. we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios, that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure. the total number of apartment units under development, costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation;
▪   debt financing and other capital required by the company may not be available or may only be available on adverse terms;
▪   labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated;
▪   occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing, increasing portions of single family housing stock being converted to rental use, rental housing subsidized by the government, other government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing, governmental regulations, slow or negative employment growth and household formation, the availability of low-interest mortgages or the availability of mortgages requiring little or no down payment for single family home buyers, changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond the company's control; and
▪   additional factors as discussed in part i of this annual report on form 10-k, particularly those under "item 1a. risk factors".
forward-looking statements and related uncertainties are also included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report.
overview equity residential ("eqr"), a maryland real estate investment trust ("reit") formed in march 1993, is an s&p 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top united states growth markets. erp operating limited partnership ("erpop"), an illinois limited partnership, was formed in may 1993 to conduct the multifamily residential property business of equity residential. eqr has elected to be taxed as a reit. references to the "company," "we," "us" or "our" mean collectively eqr, erpop and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by eqr and/or erpop. references to the "operating partnership" mean collectively erpop and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by erpop.
eqr is the general partner of, and as of december 31, 2014 owned an approximate 96.2% ownership interest in, erpop. all of the company's property ownership, development and related business operations are conducted through the operating partnership and eqr has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in erpop. eqr issues equity from time to time but does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the operating partnership. the operating partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the company, including the company's ownership interests in its joint ventures. the operating partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity.
the company's corporate headquarters are located in chicago, illinois and the company also operates property management offices in each of its markets. as of december 31, 2014, the company had approximately 3,500 employees who provided real estate operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition, development and other support functions.
business objectives and operating and investing strategies the company invests in high quality apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return (operating income plus capital appreciation) on invested capital.
we seek to maximize the income and capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property operations and appreciation. we are focused primarily on the six core coastal, high barrier to entry markets of boston, new york, washington dc, southern california (including los angeles, orange county and san diego), san francisco and seattle. these markets generally feature one or more of the following characteristics that allow us to increase rents:
▪   high barriers to entry where, because of land scarcity or government regulation, it is difficult or costly to build new apartment properties, creating limits on new supply;
▪   high home ownership costs;
▪   strong economic growth leading to job growth and household formation, which in turn leads to high demand for our apartments;
▪   urban core locations with an attractive quality of life and higher wage job categories leading to high resident demand and retention; and
▪   favorable demographics contributing to a larger pool of target residents with a high propensity to rent apartments.
our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders. revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties, cost-effectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew their leases upon expiration. while we believe that it is our high-quality, well-located assets that bring our customers to us, it is the customer service and superior value provided by our on-site personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends.
we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged. many of our residents utilize our web-based resident portal which allows them to sign and renew their leases, review their accounts and make payments, provide feedback and make service requests on-line.
acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt, sales of properties and joint venture agreements. in addition, the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership ("op units") as consideration for the acquired properties. such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. the company may acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities as well as options to buy more land in the future. the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure proceedings.
over the past several years, the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entry/non-core markets to high barrier to entry/core markets. since 2005, the company has sold over 166,000 apartment units primarily in its non-core markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately $16.1 billion, acquired over 67,000 apartment units primarily in its core markets for approximately $19.5 billion and began approximately $5.3 billion of development projects primarily in its core markets. we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets primarily in the following six core coastal metropolitan areas: boston, new york, washington d.c., southern california, san francisco and seattle. we also have investments (in the aggregate about 12.1% of our noi at december 31, 2014) in the two core markets of south florida and denver but do not currently intend to acquire or develop new assets in these markets. further, we are in the process of exiting phoenix and orlando and will use sales proceeds from these markets to acquire and/or develop new assets and for other corporate purposes.
as part of its strategy, the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties, partially completed or partially occupied properties and takes options on land or acquires land on which apartment properties can be constructed. we intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets. as of december 31, 2014, no single market/metropolitan area accounted for more than 17.5% of our noi, though no guarantee can be made that noi concentration may not increase in the future.
we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed. we provide many classroom and on-line training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining our properties and improvements, equipment and appliances. we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions. we monitor our employees' engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores.
we have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities. sustainability and social responsibility are key drivers of our focus on creating the best apartment communities for residents to live, work and play. we have a dedicated in-house team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business, including investment activities, development, property operations and property management activities. with its high density, multifamily housing is, by its nature, an environmentally friendly property type. our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrian-friendly urban locations near public transportation. when developing and renovating our properties, we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets. we continue to implement a combination of irrigation, lighting, hvac and renewable energy improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption. the company was recently named as the 2014 north american residential - large cap sector leader by the global real estate sustainability benchmark ("gresb") survey, a globally recognized analysis of the sustainability indicators of approximately 650 real estate portfolios worldwide. for additional information regarding our sustainability efforts, see our december 2014 corporate social responsibility and sustainability report at our website, www.equityresidential.com.
current environment during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company acquired six consolidated rental properties consisting of 1,353 apartment units for $469.9 million and two land parcels for $28.8 million. we believe our access to capital, our ability to execute large, complex transactions and our ability to efficiently stabilize large scale lease up properties provide us with a competitive advantage, which was demonstrated in the archstone transaction that closed in 2013. the company currently budgets consolidated rental acquisitions of approximately $500.0 million during the year ending december 31, 2015 to be funded with proceeds from rental dispositions (see discussion below).
the company started construction on six projects representing 2,267 apartment units totaling approximately $1.2 billion of development costs during the year ended december 31, 2014. the company significantly increased its development starts in 2014 as compared to the past few years and while construction activity will remain elevated in 2015, starts should return to more normalized levels. the company has budgeted approximately $1.0 billion of combined new apartment construction starts on land currently owned during the years ending december 31, 2015 and 2016, with approximately $400.0 million occurring in 2015 and the balance occurring in 2016. we currently budget spending approximately $700.0 million on development costs during the year ending december 31, 2015. this capital will be primarily sourced with excess operating cash flow, expected debt offerings in 2015 and borrowings on our revolving credit facility and/or commercial paper program.
the company expects to continue to sell non-core assets and reduce its exposure to non-core markets as we believe these assets will have lower long-term returns and we can sell them for prices that we believe are favorable. the company sold ten consolidated rental properties consisting of 3,092 apartment units for $467.0 million, one unconsolidated rental property consisting of 388 apartment units for $62.5 million (sales price for the unconsolidated rental property is the gross sales price and eqr owned an 85% interest) and three land parcels for $62.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2014. the company currently budgets consolidated rental dispositions of approximately $500.0 million during the year ending december 31, 2015, which includes the company's three remaining properties in the orlando market.
we currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets. in june 2014, the company completed a $450.0 million unsecured five year note offering with a coupon of 2.375% and an all-in effective interest rate of approximately 2.52% as well as a $750.0 million unsecured thirty year note offering with a coupon of 4.5% and an all-in effective interest rate of approximately 4.57%. the company used the proceeds from these offerings to repay its $750.0 million unsecured term loan facility that was scheduled to mature on january 11, 2015 and to repay the outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility. in february 2015, the company entered into a $500.0 million commercial paper program, which will allow for daily, weekly, or monthly borrowing at low floating rates of interest. we believe this commercial paper program will allow the company to continue to reduce its already low cost of capital and expect to use the program to replace a portion of the amount that we would otherwise have outstanding under our revolving line of credit. the company has budgeted $950.0 million of secured or unsecured debt offerings during 2015, excluding usage of the commercial paper program.
we believe that cash and cash equivalents, securities readily convertible to cash, current availability on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, expected debt offerings and disposition proceeds for 2015 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions, debt maturities and existing development projects through 2015. we expect that our remaining longer-term funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings, equity issuances, property dispositions, joint ventures and cash generated from operations.
there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac (the "government sponsored enterprises" or "gses"). through their lender originator networks, the gses are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the company's properties. the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities. any changes to their mandates, further reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have a significant impact on the company and may, among other things, lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings. the gse's regulator has set overall volume limits on most of the lending activities of the gses. for 2015, these activities are generally consistent with historical requirements and are not anticipated to materially impact the gses' overall multifamily lending activity. however, going forward the regulator could require the gses to focus more of their lending activities on small borrowers or properties that the regulator deems affordable, which may or may not include the company's assets. for 2015, the gse's regulator imposed a limit of $60 billion in multifamily lending volume which excluded certain affordable housing loans, loans to small multifamily properties, and loans to manufactured housing communities. this limit along with the exclusion of certain types of lending activity reflects a modest increase to 2014 levels. while no reductions are currently anticipated, there can be no assurances that the gses regulator does not mandate reductions or increases in loan pricing in the future. such reductions in gse activity or increases in gse loan pricing could provide a competitive advantage to us by making the cost of financing multifamily properties more expensive for other multifamily owners while the company continues to have access to cheaper capital in the public and private debt and equity markets. over time, we expect that other lenders, including banks, the commercial mortgage-backed securities market and life insurance companies, will become larger sources of debt capital to the multifamily market because multifamily properties are attractive to lenders due to their relatively stable cash flows.
same store revenues increased 4.3% during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, which was above the high end of our original guidance range of 3.0% to 4.0% that we provided in february 2014. strong demand and continued strength in occupancy levels drove the outperformance during 2014, which should continue into 2015. in addition, improving labor markets, robust household formation and declining single family home ownership levels should keep demand for rental housing high and produce above trend growth for 2015. we anticipate same store revenue increases ranging from 3.75% to 4.50% and same store noi increases ranging from 4.0% to 5.5% for 2015 as compared to 2014.
all of our markets are generally performing well, except for washington d.c. as noted above, demand for our apartments has been strong, with high occupancy and low turnover due in part to declines in move outs to buy new homes. in general, new supply continues to be absorbed in an orderly fashion with lease-ups occurring faster than expected and only minimal impact on rents at nearby stabilized assets. during 2015, we currently anticipate three groupings of same store revenue growth, with san francisco, seattle, denver and orange county producing 5% or higher, new york, los angeles, san diego, south florida and boston producing 3% to 5% (although boston might be in the high 2% range) and washington d.c. producing flat to slightly positive growth. washington d.c., which is our largest market, has seen record absorption despite anemic job growth in 2014. however, washington d.c. continues to show signs of stress as substantial new supply and the impact of government budget constraints and cutbacks have dampened the metro area economy. despite slow growth in the overall economy and the issues noted in washington d.c., our business continues to perform well because of the combined forces of demographics, household formations and increasing consumer preference for the flexibility of rental housing, all of which should ensure a continued strong demand for rental housing.
same store expenses increased 1.8% during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, which was below the low end of our original guidance range of 2.0% to 3.0% that we provided in february 2014. by leveraging the integration of the archstone portfolio through lower onsite payroll and a more efficient property management company, we were able to offset 5.6% and 5.0% increases in same store real estate taxes and utilities, respectively. same store expense growth in the controllable property level expenses (excluding real estate taxes and utilities) declined 1.5% during 2014 as compared to 2013. the company anticipates that 2015 same store expenses will increase 2.5% to 3.5%, with increases in real estate taxes expected to approximate 5.0% for the full year 2015. the increase in real estate taxes is primarily due to rate and value increases in certain states and municipalities, reflecting those states' and municipalities' continued economic challenges and the dramatic improvement in apartment values and fundamentals as well as the continued burn off of 421a tax abatements in new york city. we expect full year utility costs to decline approximately 1.0% due to significant declines in natural gas and heating oil, partially offset by higher costs for electricity, water, sewer and trash. with an improving labor market and the archstone portfolio staffing fully optimized, we anticipate same store payroll costs to grow 2.0% to 3.0% in 2015 over 2014.
we believe that the company is well-positioned as of december 31, 2014 because our properties are geographically diverse, were approximately 95.1% occupied (95.7% on a same store basis) and the long-term demographic picture is positive. we believe certain market areas, especially washington d.c., downtown boston and cambridge and seattle, will see substantial near term multifamily supply; yet total new supply levels for our core markets remain within historical ranges. we believe over the longer term that our core markets will absorb future supply without material marketwide disruption because of the high occupancy levels we currently experience and increasing household formations. we have seen evidence of this in seattle as supply has been absorbed and rental rates continue to grow. we believe our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt maturities and development costs in the near term, and should also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future.
the current environment information presented above is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
results of operations in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy, the company continued to invest primarily in apartment properties located in our high barrier to entry/core markets and primarily sell properties in our low barrier to entry/non-core markets during the years ended december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013. in summary, we:
▪   acquired four consolidated apartment properties consisting of 1,011 apartment units for $363.2 million at a weighted cap rate (see definition below) of 4.8% and two land parcels for $28.8 million;
▪   acquired two consolidated apartment properties, one that had just completed lease up and the other which was still in lease up, consisting of 342 apartment units for $106.6 million and are expected to stabilize at a 6.4% yield on cost and a 4.9% yield on cost, respectively;
▪   acquired the 95% equity interest it did not own in one previously unconsolidated development project with an anticipated stabilized real estate value of $87.5 million at completion and an adjusted purchase price of $64.2 million;
▪   sold ten consolidated apartment properties consisting of 3,092 apartments units for $467.0 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.1% generating an unlevered internal rate of return ("irr"), inclusive of management costs, of 8.9% and three land parcels for $62.6 million; and
▪   sold one unconsolidated property for $62.5 million (sales price listed is the gross sales price and eqr owned an 85% interest).
▪   acquired $8.5 billion of apartment properties consisting of 73 consolidated properties and 20,914 apartment units (inclusive of eight long-term ground leases) at a weighted average cap rate (see definition below) of 4.9% and 14 consolidated land parcels for $260.6 million, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets;
▪   acquired three consolidated master-leased properties consisting of 853 apartment units (inclusive of one long-term ground lease) for $249.6 million at a weighted average cap rate of 5.6%;
▪   acquired two consolidated uncompleted developments for $36.6 million;
▪   acquired one unconsolidated apartment property consisting of 336 apartment units for $5.1 million at a weighted average cap rate of 5.8% and one unconsolidated land parcel for $6.6 million;
▪   acquired two unconsolidated uncompleted developments for $14.9 million;
▪   sold $4.5 billion of consolidated apartment properties consisting of 94 properties and 29,180 apartment units at a weighted average cap rate of 6.0% generating an unlevered irr, inclusive of management costs, of 10.0% (excluding the sale of three archstone assets), the majority of which were in exit or less desirable markets;
▪   sold seven consolidated land parcels and one consolidated commercial building for $130.4 million; and
▪   sold one unconsolidated land parcel for $26.4 million (sales price is the gross sales price and eqr's share of the net sales proceeds approximated 25%).
the company's primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income ("noi"). noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense. the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of its operating performance because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the company's apartment communities. the cap rate is generally the first year noi yield (net of replacements) on the company's investment.
properties that the company owned and were stabilized (see definition below) for all of both 2014 and 2013 as well as the 18,465 stabilized apartment units acquired in the archstone acquisition that are owned and managed by the company (the "2014 same store properties"), which represented 97,911 apartment units, impacted the company's results of operations. properties that the company owned for all of both 2013 and 2012 (the "2013 same store properties"), which represented 80,247 apartment units, also impacted the company's results of operations. both the 2014 same store properties and 2013 same store properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.
the following tables provide a rollforward of the apartment units included in same store properties and a reconciliation of apartment units included in same store properties to those included in total properties for the year ended december 31, 2014:

note: properties are considered "stabilized" when they have achieved 90% occupancy for three consecutive months. properties are included in same store when they are stabilized for all of the current and comparable periods presented. same store includes the 18,465 stabilized apartment units acquired in the archstone acquisition that are owned and managed by the company, with pro forma pre-ownership results for the period january 1, 2013 to february 27, 2013.
(1)   includes one property containing 322 apartment units acquired in 2013 separately from the archstone acquisition.
(2)   includes properties in various stages of lease-up and properties where lease-up has been completed but the properties were not stabilized for the comparable periods presented.
(3)   includes three properties containing 853 apartments units acquired on february 27, 2013 in conjunction with the archstone acquisition that are owned by the company but the entire projects are master leased to a third party corporate housing provider and the company earns monthly net rental income.
(4)   includes three properties containing 1,536 apartment units acquired on february 27, 2013 in conjunction with the archstone acquisition that were subsequently sold in 2013.
the company's acquisition, disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013. the impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, the company reported diluted earnings per share/unit of $1.73 compared to $5.16 per share/unit for the year ended december 31, 2013. the difference is primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion in higher gains on property sales in 2013 vs. 2014, partially offset by $69.6 million of higher merger-related expenses incurred in 2013 vs. 2014 in connection with the archstone acquisition, $122.8 million of higher debt extinguishment costs incurred in 2013 vs. 2014 in connection with early debt extinguishment of existing mortgage notes payable to manage the company's post archstone 2017 maturities profile and higher depreciation in 2013 as a direct result of in-place residential lease intangibles acquired in the archstone transaction.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, income from continuing operations increased approximately $825.3 million when compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in continuing operations is discussed below.
revenues from the 2014 same store properties increased $101.6 million primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents, higher occupancy and a decrease in turnover. expenses from the 2014 same store properties increased $14.8 million primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and utilities, partially offset by lower property management costs. the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2014 same store properties:

(1)   on-site payroll - includes payroll and related expenses for on-site personnel including property managers, leasing consultants and maintenance staff.
(2)   utilities - represents gross expenses prior to any recoveries under the resident utility billing system ("rubs"). recoveries are reflected in rental income.
(3)   repairs and maintenance - includes general maintenance costs, apartment unit turnover costs including interior painting, routine landscaping, security, exterminating, fire protection, snow removal, elevator, roof and parking lot repairs and other miscellaneous building repair costs.
(4)   property management costs - includes payroll and related expenses for departments, or portions of departments, that directly support on-site management. these include such departments as regional and corporate property management, property accounting, human resources, training, marketing and revenue management, procurement, real estate tax, property legal services and information technology.
(5)   other on-site operating expenses - includes ground lease costs and administrative costs such as office supplies, telephone and data charges and association and business licensing fees.
the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income to noi for the 2014 same store properties:
fee and asset management revenue                       (9,437     )                (9,698     )
fee and asset management expense                        5,429                       6,460
for properties that the company acquired prior to january 1, 2014 and expects to continue to own through december 31, 2015, the company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending december 31, 2015:
revenue change                   3.75% to 4.5%
expense change                    2.5% to 3.5%
noi change                        4.0% to 5.5%
the company anticipates consolidated rental acquisitions of $500.0 million and consolidated rental dispositions of $500.0 million and expects that acquisitions will have a 1.00% lower cap rate than dispositions for the full year ending december 31, 2015.
these 2015 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
non-same store operating results increased approximately $34.5 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2013 and 2014 as well as operations from the company's completed development properties, but exclude the 18,465 stabilized apartment units acquired in the archstone acquisition that are owned and managed by the company. this increase primarily resulted from:
▪   development and newly stabilized development properties in lease-up of $20.6 million;
▪   operating properties acquired in 2013 and 2014 of $13.8 million (excluding operating properties acquired in the archstone acquisition);
▪   other miscellaneous properties (including three master-leased properties acquired in the archstone acquisition) of $1.7 million; and
▪   partially offset by a decrease in operating activities from other miscellaneous operations.
see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company's segment disclosures.
fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $0.8 million or 23.8% primarily as a result of higher revenue earned on management of the company's military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base and lower expenses, partially offset by lower fees earned on management of the company's unconsolidated development joint ventures.
property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. these expenses decreased approximately $4.7 million or 5.6%. this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in payroll-related costs, office rent, education/conferences and legal and professional fees.
depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, decreased approximately $220.1 million or 22.5% primarily as a result of in-place residential lease intangibles which are generally amortized over a six month period and can significantly elevate depreciation expense following an acquisition, especially during 2013 as a direct result of the archstone acquisition, partially offset by additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2014, development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned.
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $11.2 million or 18.1% primarily due to a decrease in payroll-related costs and office rent. the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $51.0 million to $53.0 million for the year ending december 31, 2015, excluding approximately $9.7 million in duplicative costs related to the company's revised executive compensation program. the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately $0.8 million or 15.5% primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of certain investment securities during the year ended december 31, 2013 that did not reoccur in 2014, partially offset by proceeds received from various insurance/litigation settlements totaling $2.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 that did not occur in 2013. the company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate $0.5 million for the year ending december 31, 2015. the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
other expenses from continuing operations decreased approximately $20.6 million or 69.4% primarily due to the closing of the archstone acquisition during the year ended december 31, 2013 and the significant decline in transaction activity during the year ended december 31, 2014.
interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $140.8 million or 23.1% primarily as a result of $122.8 million of higher debt extinguishment costs incurred on early debt prepayments and write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs in 2013 vs. 2014 related to managing the company's post archstone 2017 maturities profile and higher capitalized interest in 2014. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company capitalized interest costs of approximately $52.8 million as compared to $47.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 4.74% as compared to 4.91% (excluding $107.6 million in net debt extinguishment costs) for the year ended december 31, 2013. the company anticipates that interest expense from continuing operations will approximate $442.8 million to $455.1 million (excluding debt extinguishment costs) for the year ending december 31, 2015. the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately $0.2 million or 19.2% primarily due to increases in estimated taxes related to properties sold by the company's trs in 2014 vs. 2013, partially offset by a reduction and timing of all other taxes. the company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate $1.0 million to $1.5 million for the year ending december 31, 2015. the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
loss from investments in unconsolidated entities decreased by $50.2 million or 86.3% primarily due to indirect costs incurred in 2013 from the archstone acquisition through the company's joint ventures with avb such as severance and retention bonuses that have significantly decreased in 2014.
net gain on sales of real estate properties increased $212.7 million as a result of the sale of ten consolidated apartment properties during the year ended december 31, 2014 that did not meet the new criteria for reporting discontinued operations. see notes 2 and 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
discontinued operations, net decreased approximately $2.1 billion or 99.9% between the periods under comparison. this decrease is primarily due to substantially higher sales volume during the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2014 and due to the company's adoption of the new discontinued operations standard effective january 1, 2014. see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, the company reported diluted earnings per share of $5.16 compared to $2.70 per share for the year ended december 31, 2012. the difference is primarily due to higher gains from property sales in 2013 vs. 2012 and higher total property net operating income driven by the positive impact of the company's same store and stabilized archstone properties, partially offset by $73.9 million of merger-related expenses incurred in connection with the archstone acquisition, $121.7 million of costs incurred in connection with early debt extinguishment of existing mortgage notes payable to manage the company's post archstone 2017 maturities profile, higher depreciation as a direct result of the archstone transaction, the issuance of common shares to the public in december 2012 and to an affiliate of lehman brothers holdings inc. in february 2013 as partial consideration for the archstone acquisition and the company's recognition of $150.0 million in archstone-related termination fees in 2012.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, loss from continuing operations increased approximately $328.5 million when compared to the year ended december 31, 2012. the decrease in continuing operations is discussed below.
revenues from the 2013 same store properties increased $76.0 million primarily as a result of an increase in average rental rates charged to residents, slightly higher occupancy and a decrease in turnover. expenses from the 2013 same store properties increased $20.2 million primarily due to increases in real estate taxes, utilities and repairs and maintenance costs, partially offset by lower property management costs. the following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2013 same store properties:

non-same store operating results increased approximately $377.3 million and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2012 and 2013, as well as operations from the company's completed development properties. although the operations of both the non-same store assets and the same store assets have been positively impacted during the year ended december 31, 2013, the non-same store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total noi to the company's overall operating results primarily due to 2012 and 2013 acquisitions, increasing occupancy for properties in lease-up and a longer ownership period in 2013 than 2012. this increase primarily resulted from:
▪   development and other miscellaneous properties in lease-up of $7.2 million;
▪   operating properties acquired in 2013 as part of the archstone transaction of $346.0 million;
▪   newly stabilized development and other miscellaneous properties of $5.5 million; and
▪   partially offset by an allocation of property management costs not included in same store results and operating activities from other miscellaneous operations.
see also note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company's segment disclosures.
fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, decreased approximately $1.7 million or 34.1% primarily as a result of higher expenses and lower revenue earned on management of the company's military housing ventures at fort lewis and mcchord air force base, partially offset by fees earned on management of the company's unconsolidated development joint ventures.
property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the company's properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. these expenses increased approximately $2.4 million or 3.0%. this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payroll-related costs and an increase in computer operations due to the modernization of employee technology, partially offset by the timing of legal and professional fees.
depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $418.3 million or 74.6% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2013 (including the archstone properties), development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned, partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of furniture, fixtures and equipment that were fully depreciated. in-place residential lease intangibles are generally amortized over a six month period and can significantly elevate depreciation expense following an acquisition, especially during 2013 as a direct result of the archstone acquisition.
general and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, increased approximately $14.9 million or 31.6% primarily due to an increase in payroll-related costs, which is largely a result of higher and accelerated long-term compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and higher compensation related to the archstone transaction, as well as an increase in office rent.
interest and other income from continuing operations decreased $145.8 million or 96.5% primarily due to the company recognizing $150.0 million in archstone-related termination fees during the year ended december 31, 2012, partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of investment securities and technology investments during the year ended december 31, 2013.
other expenses from continuing operations, which includes direct costs incurred from the archstone acquisition such as investment banking and legal/accounting costs, increased approximately $1.8 million or 6.6% as a result of the closing of the archstone acquisition during the year ended december 31, 2013, partially offset by lower property pursuit costs as the company focused on its pursuit of archstone.
interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $132.5 million or 27.8% primarily as a result of the following:
▪   $121.7 million of costs incurred on early debt extinguishments in 2013 on existing mortgage notes payable to manage the company's post archstone 2017 maturities profile;
▪   interest expense on the company's $750.0 million delayed draw term loan facility which was fully drawn on february 27, 2013; and
▪   higher capitalized interest in 2013 (see below);
during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company capitalized interest costs of approximately $47.3 million as compared to $22.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. this capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated
projects under development. the effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended december 31, 2013 was 4.91% (excluding $107.6 million in net debt extinguishment costs) as compared to 5.37% for the year ended december 31, 2012.
loss from investments in unconsolidated entities, which includes indirect costs incurred from the archstone acquisition through the company's joint ventures with avb, increased by $58.1 million primarily as a result of severance obligations and retention bonuses in connection with the archstone acquisition through our 60% interest in unconsolidated joint ventures as well as the gain on sale of one unconsolidated land parcel during the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to no sales during the year ended december 31, 2012.
discontinued operations, net increased approximately $1.4 billion between the periods under comparison. this increase is primarily due to higher gains on sales from dispositions during the year ended december 31, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, partially offset by properties sold in 2013 that reflect operations for a partial period in 2013 in contrast to a full period in 2012. see note 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

as of january 1, 2014, the company had approximately $53.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and it had $2.35 billion available under its revolving credit facility (net of $34.9 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of $115.0 million outstanding). after taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the company's cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2014 was approximately $40.1 million and the amount available on its revolving credit facility was $2.12 billion (net of $43.8 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of $333.0 million outstanding).
during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the following:
▪   issued $450.0 million of five-year 2.375% fixed rate public notes, receiving net proceeds of $449.6 million before underwriting fees and other expenses, at an all-in effective interest rate of 2.52%;
▪   issued $750.0 million of thirty-year 4.50% fixed rate public notes, receiving net proceeds of $744.7 million before underwriting fees, hedge termination costs and other expenses, at an all-in effective interest rate of 4.57%;
▪   received approximately $79.6 million representing the company's pro rata share of the proceeds/distributions that have been repatriated to the residual jv as a result of the disposition of the german portfolio fund, the german management company and the remaining wholly-owned german real estate assets that were acquired by the residual jv as part of the archstone acquisition (see note 6);
▪   received approximately $20.3 million for the sale of one unconsolidated property in which the company had an 85% interest; and
▪   issued approximately 2.2 million common shares related to share option exercises and espp purchases and received net proceeds of $86.0 million, which were contributed to the capital of the operating partnership in exchange for additional op units (on a one-for-one common share per op unit basis).
during the year ended december 31, 2014, the above proceeds along with net cash flow from operations and availability on the company's revolving line of credit were primarily utilized to:
▪   acquire six rental properties, two land parcels and additional development rights at one of its existing land sites for approximately $470.0 million;
▪   acquire its partner's 95% interest in one previously unconsolidated property for cash consideration of approximately $44.8 million;
▪   invest $530.4 million primarily in development projects;
▪   repay its $750.0 million unsecured term loan facility in conjunction with the note issuances discussed above;
▪   repay $500.0 million of 5.250% unsecured notes at maturity; and
on february 27, 2013, the company issued 34,468,085 common shares to an affiliate of lehman brothers holdings inc. as partial consideration for the portion of the archstone portfolio acquired by the company. the shares had a total value of $1.9 billion based on the february 27, 2013 closing price of eqr common shares of $55.99 per share. concurrent with this transaction, erpop issued 34,468,085 op units to eqr. on march 7, 2013, eqr filed a shelf registration statement relating to the resale of these shares by the selling shareholders. lehman has since sold all of these common shares.
in september 2009, eqr announced the establishment of an at-the-market ("atm") share offering program which would allow eqr to sell common shares from time to time into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. per the terms of erpop's partnership agreement, eqr contributes the net proceeds from all equity offerings to the capital of erpop in exchange for additional op units (on a one-for-one common share per op unit basis). eqr may, but shall have no obligation to, sell common shares through the atm share offering program in amounts and at times to be determined by eqr. actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by eqr from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of eqr's common shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for eqr. on july 30, 2013, the board of trustees approved an increase to the amount of shares which be may offered under the atm program to 13.0 million common shares and extended the program maturity to july 2016. eqr has not issued any shares under this program since september 14, 2012.  through february 20, 2015, eqr has cumulatively issued approximately 16.7 million common shares at an average price of $48.53 per share for total consideration of approximately $809.9 million.
depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, eqr may repurchase its common shares pursuant to its existing share repurchase program authorized by the board of trustees. effective july 30, 2013, the board of trustees approved an increase and modification to the company's share repurchase program to allow for the potential repurchase of up to 13.0 million shares. eqr repurchased approximately $1.8 million (31,240 shares at a price of $56.87 per share) of its common shares (all related to the vesting of employees' restricted shares) during the year ended december 31, 2014. no open market repurchases have occurred since 2008. as of february 20, 2015, eqr has remaining authorization to repurchase an additional 12,968,760 of its shares. see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
depending on its analysis of prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, the company may from time to time seek to repurchase and retire its outstanding debt in open market or privately negotiated transactions.

the company generally expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. under normal operating conditions, the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions.
the company has a flexible dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the company's core business and provide transparency to investors. beginning in 2014, the company began paying its annual dividend based on 65% of the midpoint of the range of normalized ffo guidance customarily provided as part of the company's fourth quarter earnings release. the company's 2014 annual dividend payout was $2.00 per share and the company paid four quarterly dividends of $0.50 per share in 2014. the company expects the 2015 annual dividend payout will be $2.21 per share and the company intends to pay four quarterly dividends of $0.5525 per share in 2015. all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the board of trustees. the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking. while our current dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute, it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly should operating results deteriorate. however, whether due to changes in the dividend policy or otherwise, there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions, which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions and/or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference. should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, the company's financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels. the company believes that its expected 2015 operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions.
the company also expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as lump sum unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities, including additional op units, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and cash generated from operations after all distributions. in addition, the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. the fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. of the $27.7 billion in investment in real estate on the company's balance sheet at december 31, 2014, $19.1 billion or 69.1% was unencumbered. however, there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise.
as of february 20, 2015, erpop's long-term credit ratings from standard & poor's ("s&p"), moody's and fitch for its outstanding senior debt was bbb+ (positive outlook), baa1 (positive outlook) and bbb+, respectively. as of february 20, 2015, eqr's long-term equity ratings from s&p, moody's and fitch for its outstanding preferred equity was bbb+ (positive outlook), baa2 (positive outlook) and bbb-, respectively. as of february 20, 2015, erpop's short-term credit ratings from s&p, moody's and fitch for its outstanding commercial paper was a-2, p-2 and f-2, respectively. eqr does not have short-term credit ratings.
on january 11, 2013, the company replaced its existing $1.75 billion facility with a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing april 1, 2018. the company has the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. the interest rate on advances under the facility will generally be libor plus a spread (currently 1.05%) and the company pays an annual facility fee (currently 15 basis points). both the spread and the facility fee are dependent on the credit rating of the company's long-term debt. as of february 20, 2015, there was available borrowings of $1.94 billion on the revolving credit facility (net of $43.8 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit, net of $300.0 million outstanding on the credit facility and net of $220.0 million outstanding on the commercial paper program) (see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the commercial paper program). this facility may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short-term liquidity requirements.
see note 18 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to december 31, 2014.
capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property. we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories:
▪   replacements (inside the apartment unit). these include:
•   mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc;
•   furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; and
all replacements are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life. we expense as incurred all make-ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual apartment units and the repair of any replacement item noted above.
▪   building improvements (outside the apartment unit). these include:
•   amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices;
•   major building mechanical equipment systems;
•   major landscaping and grounds improvement; and
all building improvements are depreciated over a five to fifteen-year estimated useful life. we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500 (selected projects must exceed $10,000); (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) improves the value of the asset.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $186.0 million. this includes the following (amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts):

for the year ended december 31, 2013, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $135.8 million. this includes the following (amounts in thousands except for apartment unit and per apartment unit amounts):

(1)   total apartment units - excludes 1,669 unconsolidated apartment units and 5,113 military housing apartment units for which repairs and maintenance expenses and capital expenditures to real estate are self-funded and do not consolidate into the company's results.
(2)   replacements - includes new expenditures inside the apartment units such as appliances, mechanical equipment, fixtures and flooring, including carpeting. replacements for same store properties also include $19.5 million spent in 2013 on apartment unit renovations/rehabs (primarily kitchens and baths) on 2,560 same store apartment units (equating to about $7,600 per apartment unit rehabbed) designed to reposition these assets for higher rental levels in their respective markets. the company also completed apartment unit renovations/ rehabs (primarily kitchens and baths) on 1,200 non-same store apartment units (primarily archstone properties), equating to a total cost of approximately $11.9 million.
(4)   non-same store properties - primarily includes all properties acquired during 2012 and 2013, plus any properties in lease-up and not stabilized as of january 1, 2012. per apartment unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 19,493 apartment units. includes approximately ten months of activity for the archstone properties.
(5)   other - primarily includes expenditures for properties sold.
in 2014, the company spent $1,829 per apartment unit of capital expenditures, inclusive of apartment unit renovation/rehab costs, or $1,304 per apartment unit excluding apartment unit renovation/rehab costs on its same store properties. these amounts represented an increase in the cost per unit over 2013, which was primarily driven by increases in building improvement costs (i.e roofs, mechanical systems and siding) for the archstone assets as well as certain large building improvement projects the company had planned to complete in 2013 but were delayed and instead completed in 2014. the company also accelerated its renovation/rehab efforts in 2014.
in 2015, the company estimates that it will spend approximately $1,850 per apartment unit of capital expenditures, inclusive of apartment unit renovation/rehab costs, or $1,250 per apartment unit excluding apartment unit renovation/rehab costs on its same store properties. in 2015, the company expects to spend approximately $60.0 million for all unit renovation/rehab costs (primarily on same store properties) at a weighted average cost of $9,000 per apartment unit rehabbed. these anticipated amounts represent an increase in the cost per unit over 2014, which is primarily driven by increases in planned renovation/rehab efforts in 2015 with plans to continue to create value from our properties by doing those rehabs that meet our investment parameters. the above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company's total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company's property management offices and its corporate offices, were approximately $5.3 million. the company expects to fund approximately $4.8 million in total non-real estate capital additions in 2015. the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.
capital expenditures to real estate and non-real estate capital additions are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow.
derivative instruments in the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. the company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments. the company may also use derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rates or manage commodity prices in the daily operations of the business.
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place.
see note 9 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december 31, 2014.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations archstone acquisition on february 27, 2013, in conjunction with the archstone acquisition, the company acquired unconsolidated interests in certain joint ventures. the company does not believe that these investments have a materially different impact upon its liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its other consolidated operating and/or development activities. details of these interests follow by project:
waterton tenside - this venture was formed to develop and operate a 336 unit apartment property located in atlanta, georgia. the company has a 20% equity interest with an initial basis of $5.1 million. the partner is the managing member and developed the project. the project is encumbered by a non-recourse mortgage loan that has a current outstanding balance of $30.0 million, bears interest at 3.66% and matures december 1, 2018. the company does not have substantive kick-out or participating rights. as a result, the entity is unconsolidated and recorded using the equity method of accounting.
on february 27, 2013, in connection with the archstone acquisition, subsidiaries of the company and avb entered into three limited liability company agreements (collectively, the "residual jv"). the residual jv owns certain non-core archstone assets, such as interests in a four property portfolio of apartment buildings and succeeded to certain residual archstone liabilities, such as liability for various employment-related matters. the residual jv is owned 60% by the company and 40% by avb and the company's initial investment was $147.6 million. the residual jv is managed by a management committee consisting of two members from each of the company and avb. both partners have equal participation in the management committee and all significant participating rights are shared by both partners. as a result, the residual jv is unconsolidated and recorded using the equity method of accounting.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company closed on the sale of its unconsolidated interest in the german portfolio fund, the german management company and the remaining wholly-owned german real estate assets. with these sales, all german real estate assets that were acquired by the residual jv as part of the archstone acquisition have now been sold. the company's pro rata share of the proceeds/distributions that have been repatriated to the residual jv and received by the company as a result of the german dispositions was approximately $79.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 and $98.5 million cumulatively since the closing of the archstone acquisition.
on february 27, 2013, in connection with the archstone acquisition, a subsidiary of the company and avb entered into a limited liability company agreement (the "legacy jv"), through which they assumed obligations of archstone in the form of preferred interests, some of which are governed by tax protection arrangements. during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company purchased with avb $65.0 million (of which the company's 60% share was $39.0 million) of the preferred interests assumed by the legacy jv. at december 31, 2014, the remaining preferred interests have an aggregate liquidation value of $74.6 million, our share of which is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. obligations of the legacy jv are borne 60% by the company and 40% by avb. the legacy jv is managed by a management committee consisting of two members from each of the company and avb. both partners have equal participation in the management committee and all significant participating rights are shared by both partners. as a result, the legacy jv is unconsolidated and recorded using the equity method of accounting.
other the company admitted an 80% institutional partner to two separate entities/transactions (nexus sawgrass in december 2010 and domain in august 2011), each owning a developable land parcel, in exchange for $40.1 million in cash and retained a 20% equity interest in both of these entities. these projects are now unconsolidated. details of these projects follow:
•   nexus sawgrass - this development project was completed and stabilized during the quarter ended september 30, 2014. total project costs were approximately $78.6 million and construction was predominantly funded with a long-term, non-
recourse secured loan from the partner. the mortgage loan has a maximum debt commitment of $48.7 million and a current unconsolidated outstanding balance of $48.6 million; the loan bears interest at 5.60% and matures january 1, 2021.
•   domain - this development project is substantially complete. total project costs are expected to be approximately $155.8 million and construction was predominantly funded with a long-term, non-recourse secured loan from the partner. the mortgage loan has a maximum debt commitment of $98.6 million and a current unconsolidated outstanding balance of $96.8 million; the loan bears interest at 5.75% and matures january 1, 2022.
while the company is the managing member of both of the joint ventures, was responsible for constructing both of the projects and has given certain construction cost overrun guarantees, the joint venture partner has significant participating rights and has active involvement in and oversight of the ongoing projects. the company currently has no further funding obligations related to these projects. the company's strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its financial risk related to the development of the properties. however, management does not believe that these investments have a materially different impact upon the company's liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its other consolidated development activities.
as of december 31, 2014, the company has 15 consolidated projects (including prism at park avenue south in new york city, which the company is jointly developing with toll brothers - see note 16 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion) totaling 4,917 apartment units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through september 30, 2017, as well as other completed consolidated and unconsolidated development projects that are in various stages of lease up or are stabilized. the development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in note 16 of the company's consolidated financial statements.

the following table summarizes the company's contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of december 31, 2014:
other long-term liabilities:
(b)   amounts include interest expected to be incurred on the company's secured and unsecured debt based on obligations outstanding at december 31, 2014 and inclusive of capitalized interest. for floating rate debt, the current rate in effect for the most recent payment through december 31, 2014 is assumed to be in effect through the respective maturity date of each instrument.
(c)   minimum basic rent due for various office space the company leases and fixed base rent due on ground leases for 14 properties/parcels.
(d)   estimated payments to the company's chairman, vice chairman and one former ceo based on actual and planned retirement dates.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements.
the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements. these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december 31, 2014 and are consistent with the year ended december 31, 2013.
the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. with respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. the five critical accounting policies are:
acquisition of investment properties the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.
impairment of long-lived assets the company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate, for indicators of impairment. the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal and environmental concerns, as well as the company's ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset. future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.
depreciation of investment in real estate the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5-year to 15-year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacement components over a 5-year to 10-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations.
cost capitalization see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for a discussion of the company's policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. in addition, the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as increases to depreciable property.
for all development projects, the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. the company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. these costs are reflected on the balance sheets as construction-in-progress for each specific property. the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.
during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company capitalized $22.4 million, $16.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively, of payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the execution and supervision of development activities as well as major capital and/or renovation projects.
fair value of financial instruments, including derivative instruments the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. the company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. where these are not available, the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.
funds from operations and normalized funds from operations for the year ended december 31, 2014, funds from operations ("ffo") available to common shares and units / units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units increased $318.5 million, or 36.5%, and increased $139.4 million, or 13.2%, respectively, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. for the year ended december 31, 2013, ffo available to common shares and units / units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units decreased $120.8 million, or 12.2%, and increased $173.8 million, or 19.7%, respectively, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2012.

(1)   the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines funds from operations ("ffo") (april 2002 white paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap")), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairment write-downs of depreciable operating properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be
calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. the april 2002 white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only. once the company commences the conversion of apartment units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property.
(2) normalized funds from operations ("normalized ffo") begins with ffo and excludes:
▪   property acquisition and other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and pursuit cost write-offs;
▪   gains and losses from early debt extinguishment, including prepayment penalties, preferred share/preference unit redemptions and the cost related to the implied option value of non-cash convertible debt discounts;
▪   gains and losses on the sales of non-operating assets, including gains and losses from land parcel and condominium sales, net of the effect of income tax benefits or expenses; and
▪   other miscellaneous non-comparable items.
(3)   the company believes that ffo and ffo available to common shares and units / units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), ffo and ffo available to common shares and units / units can help compare the operating performance of a company's real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. the company also believes that normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the company's operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the company's actual operating results. ffo, ffo available to common shares and units / units, normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units do not represent net income, net income available to common shares / units or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap. therefore, ffo, ffo available to common shares and units / units, normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to common shares / units or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity. the company's calculation of ffo, ffo available to common shares and units / units, normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.
(4)   ffo available to common shares and units / units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units / units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to common shares / units and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares/preference units in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the operating partnership in exchange for op units are collectively referred to as the "noncontrolling interests - operating partnership". subject to certain restrictions, the noncontrolling interests - operating partnership may exchange their op units for common shares on a one-for-one basis.

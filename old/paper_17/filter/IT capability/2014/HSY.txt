issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall and/or result in harm to the company's reputation, negatively impacting our operating results.
in order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers. issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our company's image and reputation. negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. we may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption. in addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages. costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results.
increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results.
we use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, corn sweeteners, natural gas and fuel oil.
commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including:
   commodity market fluctuations;
   currency exchange rates;
   imbalances between supply and demand;
   speculative influences;
   supplier compliance with commitments;
   political unrest in producing countries; and
   changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.
although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs. if
we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity.
we may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption. if we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
in north america, we announced a weighted average price increase in july 2014 of approximately 8% across our instant consumable, multi-pack, packaged candy and grocery lines to help offset part of the significant increases in our input costs, including raw materials, packaging, fuel, utilities and transportation, which we expect to incur in the future. while the increase was effective immediately, direct buying customers were given an opportunity to purchase transitional amounts of product at price points prior to the increase during the immediately following four-week period, and the increase is not expected to benefit seasonal sales until halloween 2015. accordingly, we expect that the majority of the financial benefit from this pricing action will impact earnings in 2015.
market demand for new and existing products could decline.
we operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. to generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers. our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:
   appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;
   our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;
   our ability to drive innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories;
   changes in product category consumption;
   our response to consumer demographics and trends; and
   consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.
there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures in these markets, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively. our largest customer, mclane company, inc., accounted for approximately 25% of our total net sales in 2014. mclane company, inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the united states to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including wal-mart stores, inc.
increased marketplace competition could hurt our business.
the global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues. some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations. in 2014, we also experienced increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which pressured confectionery category growth. in order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products. due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. in addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment.
disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.
approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing capacity is located in the united states. disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following:
   labor strikes or other labor activities;
   unavailability of raw or packaging materials; and
   operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers.
we believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions. we have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy. if we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.
our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.
from time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives. the success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval. these activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management's attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. if the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products.
changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment. these negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws and environmental laws, among others. it is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
political, economic and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results.
our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. volatility in food and energy costs, sustained global recessions, rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.
changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our company, our customers and our suppliers. a significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service
providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.
our expanding international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations.
in 2014, we derived approximately 18% of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states, versus 17% in 2013 and 16% in 2012. additionally, 35% of our total consolidated assets were located outside of the united states as of december 31, 2014. as part of our global growth strategy, we are increasing our investments outside of the united states, particularly in mexico, brazil, india and china. as a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:
   unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand;
   inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;
   difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;
   unexpected changes in regulatory environments;
   political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;
   nationalization of our properties by foreign governments;
   tax rates that may exceed those in the united states and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;
   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;
   the imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
   increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;
   the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies;
   failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; and
   failure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce.
if we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.
information technology is critically important to our business operations. we use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions. these processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others.
we invest in industry standard security technology to protect the company's data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack. our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. we measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings. additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards. we maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness. we also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology.
while we believe that our security technology and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible
and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our company, our employees, and those with whom we do business.
future developments related to civil antitrust lawsuits and the possible investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in the united states could negatively impact our reputation and our operating results.
we are a defendant in a number of civil antitrust lawsuits in the united states, including individual, class and putative class actions brought against us by purchasers of our products. the u.s. department of justice also notified the company in 2007 that it had opened an inquiry into certain alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry, but has not requested any information or documents. additional information about these proceedings is contained in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
competition and antitrust law investigations can be lengthy and violators are subject to civil and/or criminal fines and other sanctions. class action civil antitrust lawsuits are expensive to defend and could result in significant judgments, including in some cases, payment of treble damages and/or attorneys' fees to the successful plaintiff. additionally, negative publicity involving these proceedings could affect our company's brands and reputation, possibly resulting in decreased demand for our products. these possible consequences, in our opinion, currently are not expected to materially impact our financial position or liquidity, but could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which any fines, settlements or judgments are accrued or paid, respectively.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is intended to provide an understanding of hershey's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. the md&a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly in item 1a. "risk factors."
•   overview and outlook
•   non-gaap information
•   financial condition
•   critical accounting policies and estimates overview and outlook we are the largest producer of quality chocolate in north america and a global leader in chocolate and sugar confectionery. we market, sell and distribute our products under more than 80 brand names in approximately 70 countries worldwide. as of december 31, 2014, we began reporting our operations through two segments: north america and international and other.
in 2014, we continued to make progress against our strategic initiatives:
•   our u.s. business increased its overall candy, mint and gum ("cmg") market share to 31.4%, an increase of 0.3 share points versus 2013.
•   we expanded into snacks and adjacencies with the launch of hershey's spreads and the related snacksters graham dippers.
•   we sourced 30% of our cocoa needs from certified and sustainable cocoa farms, putting us in a solid position to deliver on our goal of sourcing 100% certified cocoa by 2020.
however, 2014 also presented some challenges. in our u.s. markets, we believe lower retail store traffic and changes in consumer spending patterns impacted how consumers shopped for snacks, while a number of our international markets continued to experience macroeconomic headwinds. despite these challenges, our 2014 net sales and net income growth of 3.9% and 3.2%, respectively, reflects solid performance.
for the full year 2014, our u.s. cmg retail takeaway increase of 2.7% was about one full percentage point greater than the category growth rate. however, throughout the year, retail store traffic and consumer trips were irregular. additionally, increased levels of distribution and in-store activity of items such as salty, bakery and meat snacks, by both mainstream and newer contemporary niche manufacturers, were prevalent throughout the year and drove broader snacking category growth in 2014, which we believe adversely impacted purchases of non-seasonal candy products.
our 2014 international net sales increased nearly 15%, including a 2.7% unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and net sales contribution of approximately 7%, or $54 million, from shanghai golden monkey food joint stock co., ltd. ("sgm"). excluding sgm and the unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, our international net sales increased approximately 10%.
our 2014 results were also impacted by increasing commodity and other input costs. in north america, we announced a weighted average price increase in july 2014 of approximately 8% across our instant consumable, multi-pack, packaged candy and grocery lines to help offset part of the significant increases in our input costs, including raw
materials, packaging, fuel, utilities and transportation, which we expect to incur in the future. while the increase was effective immediately, direct buying customers were given an opportunity to purchase transitional amounts of product at price points prior to the increase during the immediately following four-week period, and the increase is not expected to benefit seasonal sales until halloween 2015. therefore, this action did not materially benefit our 2014 results, but should be beneficial to our 2015 earnings.
entering 2015, we are focused on accelerating growth and we have a solid line-up of new products that will bring variety, news and excitement to the category. in addition to the fourth quarter carryover benefit from brookside crunchy clusters and reese's spreads take home jar, we are also launching kit kat white minis, hershey's caramels, ice breakers cool blasts chews, reese's spreads snacksters graham dippers and some other yet-to-be-announced new candy and snacking products. these launches will be supported with higher levels of advertising and in-store merchandising and programming that should enable us to mitigate the impact of volume elasticity related to the 2014 price increase and compete effectively across the cmg and broader snack categories. additionally, we expect advertising, including a greater shift to digital and mobile communication, to increase at a rate greater than net sales growth.
we currently estimate full year 2015 net sales growth of 5.5% to 7.5%, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures of approximately 2.5%. this reflects our expectation for continued macroeconomic headwinds in international markets and slowly improving u.s. non-seasonal trends. in addition, we now anticipate foreign currency exchange impacts to be greater than our previous estimate and to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% on full year net sales growth.
we continue to focus on growth initiatives and margin-enhancing opportunities in addition to normal productivity gains. with the conclusion of the project next century ("pnc") program, in 2015 we will begin to focus on the opportunities that exist for future incremental increases in productivity and costs savings. a portion of any potential savings from this assessment would be reinvested in initiatives to accelerate revenue growth. we continue to have good visibility into our cost structure, with the exception of dairy products which cannot be effectively hedged. we currently expect 2015 gross margin to increase approximately 135 to 145 basis points driven by the 2014 pricing action and productivity. therefore, we expect 2015 growth in earnings per share-diluted in a range of 10% to 13%, including net dilution from acquisitions and divestitures of $0.03 to $0.05 per share. we expect growth in adjusted earnings per share-diluted of 8% to 10%, as reflected in the reconciliation of reported to adjusted projections for 2015 provided below.
non-gaap information the following table provides a reconciliation of projected 2015 earnings per share-diluted and 2014 and 2013 earnings per share-diluted, each prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"), to non-gaap projected adjusted earnings per share-diluted for 2015 and adjusted earnings per share-diluted for 2014 and 2013:
acquisition integration and transaction charges        0.05 - 0.06          0.05         0.03
business realignment charges, including pnc            0.04 - 0.05          0.03         0.05
for the non-gaap adjusted earnings per share-diluted measure presented above, we have provided (1) the most directly comparable gaap measure; (2) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-gaap measure and the most directly comparable gaap measure; (3) an explanation of why our management believes this non-gaap measure provides useful information to investors; and (4) additional purposes for which we use this non-gaap measure.
we believe that the disclosure of adjusted earnings per share-diluted provides investors with a better comparison of our year-to-year operating results. we exclude the effects of certain items from earnings per share-diluted when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business. we also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business.
adjusted earnings per share-diluted excludes the impacts of acquisition integration and transaction costs; charges and non-cash impairments associated with our business realignment initiatives; the non-cash goodwill impairment charge relating to our india business; the estimated loss on the anticipated sale of our mauna loa business; and non-service-related pension expense (income).
non-service-related pension expense (income) includes interest costs, the expected return on pension plan assets, the amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and certain curtailment and settlement losses or credits. the non-service-related pension expense (income) may be quite volatile from year-to-year as a result of changes in market interest rates and market returns on pension plan assets. therefore, we have excluded non-service-related pension expense (income) from our internal performance measures, and we believe that adjusted earnings per share-diluted, excluding non-service-related pension expense (income), will provide investors with a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our ongoing business. we believe that the service cost component of our total pension benefit costs closely reflects the operating costs of our business and provides for a better comparison of our operating results from year-to-year. our most significant defined benefit pension plans were closed to most new participants in 2007, resulting in ongoing service costs that are stable and predictable.

2014 compared with 2013
net sales increased 3.9% in 2014 compared with 2013, reflecting volume growth of 4.4% and favorable net price realization of 0.2%, offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 0.7%. the volume growth was driven by incremental sales of new products in our north america and international and other segments, coupled with almost 1% of growth from the recent sgm acquisition. the pricing benefit from the mid-year price increase was largely offset by higher trade promotions and lower core volumes associated with near-term volume elasticity related to the price increase. as discussed previously, we expect the 2014 pricing action to be more impactful to our 2015 results.
2013 compared with 2012
net sales increased 7.6% in 2013 compared with 2012, reflecting volume increases of 7.8% and nominal price realization of 0.1%, offset in part by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates which reduced net sales by approximately 0.3%. higher sales of brookside products contributed approximately 1.3% to the net sales increase.
key u.s. marketplace metrics for the 52 weeks ended december 31,         2014        2013        2012
hershey's consumer takeaway increase     2.7   %     6.3   %     5.7   %
hershey's market share increase          0.3         1.1         0.6
consumer takeaway and the change in market share are provided for measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our u.s. confectionery retail business. these channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers, and convenience store channels, plus wal-mart stores, inc., partial dollar, club and military channels. hershey's spreads, the jar and instant consumable pack types, is not captured in the u.s. cmg database referenced herein, as nielsen captures this within grocery items.
these metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by nielsen and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category. in 2014, the category and hershey growth rates were below historical levels as retail store traffic and consumer trips were irregular during the year. additionally, increased levels of distribution and in-store activity of items such as salty, bakery and meat snacks, by both mainstream and newer contemporary niche manufacturers, were prevalent throughout the year and drove broader snacking category growth in 2014. despite these market dynamics, for the full year 2014, our u.s. cmg retail takeaway increased 2.7%, which exceeded the category growth rate of 1.8%, and our market share increased by 30 basis points.
2014 compared with 2013
cost of sales increased 5.7% in 2014 compared with 2013. higher costs associated with sales volume increases, higher commodity and other incremental supply chain costs and unfavorable sales mix increased total cost of sales by approximately 7.8%. the higher commodity costs were largely driven by higher dairy ingredient costs, which cannot be effectively hedged, while the unfavorable sales mix resulted from a greater proportion of seasonal sales volumes, which are typically at lower margins than non-seasonal products. these cost increases were offset in part by supply chain productivity improvements and lower pension costs, which together reduced cost of sales by approximately 2.1%.
gross margin decreased by 90 basis points in 2014 compared with 2013. supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives, favorable net price realization, and operating leverage from the higher sales volumes collectively improved gross margin by 150 basis points. the impact of lower pension expenses in 2014 in comparison with 2013 benefited 2014 gross margin by 20 basis points. however, these benefits were more than offset by higher commodity and other input costs and unfavorable sales mix which together reduced gross profit margin by approximately 260 basis points.
2013 compared with 2012
cost of sales increased 2.1% in 2013 compared with 2012. the impact of sales volume increases and supply chain cost inflation together increased cost of sales by approximately 9.4%. lower input costs, supply chain productivity improvements and a favorable sales mix reduced cost of sales by approximately 6.3%. business realignment and impairment charges of $0.4 million were included in cost of sales in 2013, compared with $36.4 million in the prior year, benefiting 2013 cost of sales by 1.0%.
gross margin increased by 290 basis points in 2013 compared with 2012. reduced input costs, supply chain productivity improvements, a favorable sales mix and lower fixed costs as a percent of sales together improved gross margin by 390 basis points. these improvements were partially offset by supply chain cost inflation which reduced gross margin by 160 basis points. the impact of lower business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2013 compared with 2012 benefited 2013 gross margin by 60 basis points.
selling, marketing and administrative
2014 compared with 2013
selling, marketing and administrative ("sm&a") expenses decreased $21.5 million or 1.1% in 2014. this includes a 3.1% reduction in advertising and related consumer marketing expenses due to the timing of new product launches, a reduction in media production costs and a decision to shift resources to other more productive areas. excluding advertising and related consumer marketing expenses, selling and administrative expenses were relatively flat compared to 2013 due to lower incentive compensation costs and discretionary cost containment efforts, offset in part by higher employee-related costs, including additional headcount in our china business and additional focused selling resources, as well as transaction costs associated with the acquisition of sgm. selling and administrative expenses in 2014 also benefited from the $4.6 million gain recorded in the first quarter on the lotte shanghai food company ("lsfc") acquisition and the $5.6 million in foreign currency gains realized on forward contracts related to the manufacturing facility under construction in johor, malaysia.
2013 compared with 2012
sm&a expenses increased $218.7 million or 12.8% in 2013. contributing to the overall increase was a 19.7% increase in advertising, consumer promotions and other marketing expenses to support core brands and the introduction of new products in the u.s. and international markets. excluding the advertising and related consumer marketing costs, selling and administrative expenses increased 8.8% primarily as a result of higher employee-related expenses, increased incentive compensation costs, legal fees and increased marketing research expenses, along with the write-off of certain assets associated with the remodeling of increased office space. there were minimal business realignment charges included in sm&a in 2013 compared with $2.5 million in 2012.

next century program in june 2010, we announced project next century (the "next century program") as part of our ongoing efforts to create an advantaged supply chain and competitive cost structure. as part of the program, production was transitioned from the company's century-old facility at 19 east chocolate avenue in hershey, pennsylvania, to an expanded west hershey facility, which was built in 1992. the next century program is essentially complete as of december 31, 2014. project-to-date costs totaled $197.9 million through december 31, 2014, in line with our estimates of total pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs of $190 million to $200 million.
in 2014 and 2013, plant closure expenses were primarily related to costs associated with the demolition of the former manufacturing facility.
in 2012, charges relating to the next century program included the following: $36.4 million recorded in cost of sales related primarily to start-up costs and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over the reduced estimated remaining useful lives; $2.4 million recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expense for project administration; business realignment charges of $15.8 million relating to a non-cash pension settlement loss resulting from lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring or leaving the company, primarily in connection with the next century program; and $20.8 million primarily related to costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility and the relocation of production lines.
planned divestiture of mauna loa in december 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell the mauna loa macadamia nut corporation. in connection with the anticipated sale, we have recorded an estimated loss of $22.3 million to reflect the disposal entity at fair value, less an estimate of the selling costs. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
india impairment in connection with our annual goodwill and other intangible asset impairment testing, in december 2014, we recorded non-cash goodwill and trademark impairment charges totaling $15.9 million associated with our business in india. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other international restructuring programs during 2014, we implemented restructuring programs at several non-u.s. entities to rationalize select manufacturing and distribution activities, resulting in severance and accelerated depreciation costs of $4.5 million. these costs are recorded within cost of sales and selling, marketing and administrative costs. we expect to incur approximately $3.7 million of additional accelerated depreciation in 2015; other remaining costs relating to these programs are not expected to be significant.
tri-us, inc. impairment charges in december 2012, the board of directors of tri-us, inc., a company that manufactured, marketed and sold nutritional beverages in which we held a controlling ownership interest, decided to cease operations as a result of operational difficulties, quality issues and competitive constraints. it was determined that investments necessary to continue the business would not generate sufficient return. accordingly, in december 2012, the company recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $7.5 million, primarily associated with the write off of goodwill and other intangible assets. these charges excluded the portion of the losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests.
income before interest and income taxes ("ebit") and ebit margin
2014 compared with 2013
ebit increased 3.7% in 2014 compared with 2013 due primarily to the higher level of gross profit and lower overall selling, marketing and administrative costs, offset in part by the higher business realignment and impairment charges in 2014, as discussed above.
ebit margin was 18.7% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. while gross margin declined by 90 basis points in 2014, this was offset by a lower level of sm&a expense as a percent of sales, which was favorable by 130 basis points in 2014.
2013 compared with 2012
ebit increased in 2013 compared with 2012 as a result of higher gross profit and lower business realignment charges, partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses. pre-tax net business realignment and impairment charges of $19.1 million were recorded in 2013 compared with $83.8 million recorded in 2012.
ebit margin increased from 16.7% in 2012 to 18.7% in 2013 as a result of higher gross margin and lower business realignment charges, partially offset by higher sm&a expenses as a percent of sales. the net impact of business realignment, impairment and acquisition charges recorded in 2013 reduced ebit margin by 30 basis points, while business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2012 reduced ebit margin by 130 basis point.
2014 compared with 2013
net interest expense was $4.8 million lower in 2014 than in 2013 due primarily to a greater level of capitalized interest in 2014 as well as higher interest income earned on short-term investments.
2013 compared with 2012
net interest expense in 2013 was $7.2 million lower than in 2012 primarily as a result of lower short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest and higher interest expense on long-term debt.
2014 compared with 2013
our effective income tax rate was 35.2% for 2014 compared with 34.4% for 2013. the 2014 effective income tax rate was higher due to unfavorable tax return true-up adjustments, unfavorable shifts of taxable income to higher tax jurisdictions, and the impact of business realignment and impairment charges with minimal tax benefit, partly offset by favorable settlement of canadian assessments and favorable settlement of u.s. audits.
2013 compared with 2012
our effective income tax rate was 34.4% for 2013 compared with 34.9% for 2012. the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2013 reflected lower state income taxes, which were higher in 2012 as a result of the impact of certain state tax legislation, and an increase in deductions associated with certain foreign tax jurisdictions, partly offset by a higher benefit in 2012 resulting from the completion of tax audits.
2014 compared with 2013
net income increased $26.4 million, or 3.2%, while earnings per share-diluted ("eps") increased $0.16, or 4.4%, in 2014 compared with 2013. the increases in both net income and eps were driven by higher sales, offset by higher commodity costs and unfavorable sales mix, as noted above. our 2014 eps also benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding, as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our board-approved repurchase programs.
2013 compared with 2012
net income increased $159.6 million, or 24.1%, while eps-diluted increased $0.72, or 24.9%, in 2013 compared with 2012. the increases in both net income and eps were driven by higher sales, lower input costs, favorable sales mix and lower business realignment and impairment charges.
segment results the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments: north america and international and other. the segments reflect our operations on a geographic basis. for segment reporting purposes, we use "segment income" to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, as well as business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs, the non-service related portion of pension expense and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. these items of our operating income are managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the codm and used for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-gaap measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. we believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not integral to our ongoing operations. for further information, see the non-gaap disclosures at the beginning of this item 7.

(1)   includes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance, and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and (d) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance.
north america the north america segment is responsible for our chocolate and sugar confectionery market position in the united states and canada. this includes developing and growing our business in chocolate, sugar confectionery, refreshment, snack, pantry and food service product lines. north america accounted for 85.6%, 86.8% and 87.5% of our net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. north america results for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:
percent / point change for the years ended december 31,                  2014                  2013                  2012          2014 vs 2013             2013 vs 2012
2014 compared with 2013
net sales of our north america segment increased $152.6 million or 2.5% in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting volume growth of 2.4%, net price realization of 0.5% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 0.4%. 2014 new product introductions, including york and kit kat minis, nutrageous relaunch, brookside crunchy clusters, lancaster soft cremes and hershey's spreads, drove the volume growth, as sales volumes for core, everyday products were unfavorably impacted by increased levels of distribution and in-store activity from confection and other snacking categories. higher levels of trade promotion reduced the benefit from the mid-year pricing action. our canada operations were impacted by the stronger u.s. dollar, which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact.
our north america segment income increased $53.6 million or 2.9% in 2014 compared to 2013, principally due to higher sales volumes and supply chain productivity improvements, which offset input cost increases and unfavorable sales mix. our core product mix in 2014 was more heavily weighted toward seasonal offerings which typically generate lower margins than our core, everyday instant consumable products. additionally, advertising, consumer promotions and marketing expenses decreased 2.8% in 2014 due to the timing of new product launches, a reduction in media production costs, and a decision to shift resources to other more productive areas.
2013 compared with 2012
net sales of our north america segment increased $387.4 million or 6.7% in 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting volume growth of 6.4%, positive net price realization of 0.5% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 0.2%. higher sales of brookside products contributed 1.4% to the 2013 net sales increase for the segment.
our north america segment income increased $206.5 million or 12.5% in 2013 compared to 2012, principally due to higher sales volumes, positive sales mix and lower commodity input costs. however, advertising, consumer promotions and marketing expenses increased 15.0% to support core brands and the introduction of new products, which offset some of the increase. additionally, segment expenses were higher as a result of increased employee-related, incentive compensation and marketing research expenses.
international and other the international and other segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture, import, market, sell or distribute chocolate, sugar confectionery and other products. currently, this includes our operations in asia, latin america, europe, africa, and the middle east, along with exports to these regions. while a minor component, this segment also includes our global retail operations, including hershey's chocolate world stores in hershey, pennsylvania, new york city, chicago, las vegas, shanghai, niagara falls (ontario), dubai and singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world. international and other accounted for 14.4%, 13.2% and 12.5% of our net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. international and other results for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:
percent / point change for the years ended december 31,                  2014                2013                2012           2014 vs 2013             2013 vs 2012
2014 compared with 2013
net sales of our international and other segment increased $123.1 million or 13.0% in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting volume growth of 17.0%, unfavorable net price realization of 1.7%, and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 2.3%. the sales volume increase was primarily due to increased demand for new and existing products in china as well as $54 million of incremental sales from the newly acquired sgm business. excluding sgm, our 2014 chocolate net sales grew 35% in china and we increased our market share to almost 10% of the chocolate category. our 2014 sales in mexico were unfavorably impacted by the challenging economic environment, while our brazil performance improved sequentially as the year progressed, finishing 2014 up approximately 7% from the prior year, excluding the impact of unfavorable currency. the unfavorable price realization reflects increased trade promotions and allowances, particularly in china and mexico where we have made additional investments to drive sales volume growth.
our international and other segment income decreased $4.6 million or 10.3% in 2014 compared to 2013, as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by higher trade promotions and a 5.9% higher investment in advertising to support core brands and the introduction of new products in our international markets. the most significant portion of this investment was focused on our china and mexico markets. we also increased headcount, particularly in china in support of sales growth.
2013 compared with 2012
net sales of our international and other segment increased $114.4 million or 13.8% in 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting volume growth of 17.0%, unfavorable net price realization of 2.4%, and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by approximately 0.9%. the sales volume increase was primarily due to sales growth in china, mexico and brazil, while the unfavorable price realization reflects increased trade promotions and allowances, particularly in china and mexico where we have made additional investments to drive sales volume growth.
our international and other segment income decreased $6.8 million or 13.2% in 2013 compared to 2012, as the benefit from higher sales volume and improved gross margins was more than offset by a 44.8% higher investment in advertising, consumer promotions and marketing expenses to support core brands and the introduction of new products in our international markets. the most significant portion of this investment was focused on our china and mexico markets.
unallocated corporate items unallocated corporate administration includes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and (d) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance.
in 2014, unallocated corporate items totaled $503.4 million compared to $533.5 million in 2013, with the reduction driven by lower incentive compensation expense as well as discretionary cost containment measures intended to mitigate the higher commodity and other input costs in 2014.
in 2013, unallocated corporate items totaled $533.5 million compared to $478.6 million in 2012, with the increase primarily a result of higher salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, higher spending on outside services and consulting, and higher legal fees and accruals.
financial condition we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, repurchase of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. we generate substantial cash from operations and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment, payment of dividends and strategic acquisitions.
operating activities                                      $838.2              $1,188.4              $1,094.8
investing activities                                      (862.6   )            (351.6   )            (473.4   )
financing activities                                      (719.3   )            (446.6   )            (586.9   )
operating activities our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by operations are impacted by sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. we meet these needs primarily with cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper.
cash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased $350.2 million relative to 2013. this decline was driven by the following factors:
•   working capital (comprised of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable) consumed cash of $169 million in 2014 compared to $29 million in 2013. higher sales volumes late in the year and slightly higher accounts receivable days sales outstanding drove higher accounts receivable balances, while bulk purchases of certain ingredients at favorable pricing resulted in higher inventory balances.
•   the impact of our hedging activities unfavorably impacted cash flow by $78 million in 2014 versus a positive $101 million impact in 2013. this reflects the impact of non-cash gains and losses amortized to income from accumulated other comprehensive income, coupled with the cash flow impact of market gains and losses on our commodity futures. our cash outlays typically increase when futures market prices are decreasing.
•   lower incentive accruals and advertising and promotion accruals drove additional reductions in 2014 operating cash flow relative to 2013.
partially offsetting these declines were higher net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, impairments and loss on disposal of business) resulting from higher sales volumes during the year.
cash provided by operating activities in 2013 increased $93.6 million as compared to 2012, primarily due to increased net earnings in 2013, partly offset by a $27 million incrementally higher investment in working capital to support the higher sales volumes. derivative activities had a similar impact on 2013 and 2012 operating cash flow.
pension and post-retirement activity. we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $38.2 million, $55.8 million, and
$83.5 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, relating to our benefit plans (including our defined benefit and other post retirement plans). the main drivers of fluctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in formulating our long-term estimates, including discount rates used to value plan obligations, expected returns on plan assets, the service and interest costs, and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses, as well as a $20 million settlement loss in 2012 relating largely to the next century program.
the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and the level of funding. we contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. cash contributions to our pension and post retirement plans totaled $53.1 million, $57.2 million and $44.2 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
investing activities our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software, purchases of short-term investments and acquisitions of businesses, partially offset by proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. we used cash of $862.6 million for investing activities in 2014 compared to $351.6 million in 2013, with the increase driven by 2014 business acquisitions and the purchase of short term investments. we used cash of $473.4 million for investing activities in 2012, which exceeded the use in 2013 due mainly to the 2012 brookside acquisition.
primary investing activities include the following:
•   capital spending. capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation, and cost savings, were $345.9 million in 2014, $323.6 million in 2013 and $258.7 million in 2012. our 2014 expenditures include $115 million relating to the construction of a manufacturing facility in malaysia, compared to $40 million in 2013. capital expenditures in 2013 and 2012 included $11.8 million and $74.7 million, respectively, relating to the next century program. capitalized software additions were primarily related to ongoing enhancements of our information systems. we expect 2015 capital expenditures, including capitalized software, to approximate $375 million to $400 million, of which $90 million to $110 million relates to the facility in malaysia.
•   acquisitions. in 2014, we spent $396.3 million to acquire three businesses, including $379.7 million for sgm and $26.6 million for allan, partially offset by net cash received of $10.0 million relating to the lsfc acquisition, whereby cash acquired in the transaction exceeded the $5.6 million paid for the controlling interest. in 2012, we acquired brookside for approximately $172.9 million. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our recent acquisitions.
financing activities our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. we used cash of $719.3 million for financing activities in 2014 compared to $446.6 million in 2013, with the increase due mainly to higher dividend payments and share repurchases, offset in part by higher short term borrowings. we used cash of $586.9 million for financing activities in 2012, which exceeded the use in 2013 primarily due to higher share repurchases, offset in part by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options and lower dividend payments.
the majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following:
•   short-term borrowings, net. in addition to utilizing cash on hand, we use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. in 2014, we generated additional cash flow from the issuance of $55.0 million in commercial paper, as well as incrementally higher borrowings at certain of our international businesses in support of sales growth.
•   share repurchases. we repurchase shares of common stock to offset the dilutive impact of treasury shares issued under our equity compensation plans. the value of these share repurchases in a given period varies based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price. in addition, we periodically repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to board-authorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder value. in 2014, we used $202.3 million to purchase 2.1 million shares pursuant to authorized programs, while we had no share repurchases under these programs in 2013. in 2012, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $124.9 million pursuant to authorized programs. as of december 31, 2014, approximately $173 million
•   proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including tax benefits. we received $175.8 million from employee exercises of stock options, including excess tax benefits, in 2014, as compared to $195.7 million in 2013 and $295.5 million in 2012. variances are driven by the number of shares exercised and the share price at the date of grant.
•   other. in september 2012, we acquired the remaining 49% interest in godrej hershey ltd. for approximately $15.8 million. since may of 2007, we had owned a 51% controlling interest on the basis of an agreement with godrej beverages and foods, ltd., a consumer goods, confectionery and food company, to manufacture and distribute confectionery products, snacks and beverages across india.
liquidity and capital resources at december 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $374.9 million, and we held short-term investments in the form of term deposits with original maturities of one-year totaling $97.1 million. in total, our cash and short-term investments declined $646.5 million compared to the 2013 year-end balance of $1.1 billion as a result of the net uses of cash outlined in the previous discussion.
approximately half of the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments at december 31, 2014 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the united states. if these amounts held outside of the united states were to be repatriated, under current law, they would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states. the cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is expected to be used to finance foreign operations and investments. we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs, including our cash needs in the united states.
we maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders' equity. our total debt was $2.2 billion at december 31, 2014 and $2.0 billion at december 31, 2013. our total debt increased in 2014 mainly due to the increase in commercial paper outstanding, additional debt assumed in the sgm acquisition and additional short-term borrowings used to fund growth in our existing china operations.
in october 2011, we entered into a five-year agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $1.1 billion, with an option to increase borrowings by an additional $400 million with the consent of the lenders. in november 2013, this agreement was amended to reduce the amount of borrowings available under the unsecured revolving credit facility to $1.0 billion, maintain the option to increase borrowings by an additional $400 million with the consent of the lenders, and extend the termination date to november 2018. in november 2014, the termination date of this agreement was extended an additional year to november 2019. as of december 31, 2014, $1.0 billion was available to borrow under the agreement and no borrowings were outstanding. the unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties and events of default. we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31, 2014. we may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions.
in addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit in various currencies with domestic and international commercial banks. as of december 31, 2014, we had available capacity of $117.9 million under these lines of credit.
furthermore, we have a current shelf registration statement filed with the united states securities and exchange commission that allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities. proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the current registration statement may be used for general corporate
requirements, including reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions, and funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements.
our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.
equity structure we have two classes of stock outstanding - common stock and class b common stock ("class b stock"). holders of the common stock and the class b stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. holders of the common stock have 1 vote per share. holders of the class b stock have 10 votes per share. holders of the common stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our board. with respect to dividend rights, holders of the common stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the class b stock.
hershey trust company, as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school, maintains voting control over the hershey company. in addition, hershey trust company currently has three representatives who are members of the company's board, one of whom is the chairman of the board. these representatives, from time to time in performing their responsibilities on the company's board, may exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our board or management. hershey trust company, as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school, in its role as controlling stockholder of the company, has indicated it intends to retain its controlling interest in the hershey company and that the company board, and not the hershey trust company board, is solely responsible and accountable for the company's management and performance.
pennsylvania law requires that the office of attorney general be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in hershey trust company, as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school, no longer having voting control of the company. the law provides specific statutory authority for the attorney general to intercede and petition the court having jurisdiction over the hershey trust company, as trustee for the benefit of milton hershey school, to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. this legislation makes it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the company.
guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
unconditional purchase obligations (4)                 2,122.3                 1,298.8                     756.7                  66.8             -
(1) includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. interest associated with variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward curve as of december 31, 2014.
(2) includes the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases primarily for offices, retail stores, warehouses and distribution facilities, and certain equipment. we do not have material capital lease obligations.
(3) represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 ("erisa"), federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006. we fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. for more information, see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
(4) purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business. amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of december 31, 2014. the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or accrued liabilities at year-end 2014, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. such amounts are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. we do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.
(5) represents liability to purchase the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares of sgm. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
in entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. we mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. we do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults.
plant construction obligations in december 2013, we entered into an agreement for the construction of a new confectionery manufacturing plant in malaysia. the total cost of construction is expected to be approximately $265 to $275 million. the plant is expected to begin operations in the second half of 2015.
asset retirement obligations we have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. costs associated with the removal of asbestos related to the closure of a manufacturing facility under the next century program were recorded primarily in 2012 and included in business realignment and impairment charges. the costs associated with the removal of asbestos from the facility were not material. with regard to other facilities, we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. we cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not
available to apply an expected present value technique. we expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos.
income tax obligations liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of these potential liabilities. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates and assumptions. we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:
l   accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities l   pension and other post-retirement benefits plans l   goodwill and other intangible assets l   commodities futures and options contracts l   income taxes management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board. while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. other significant accounting policies are outlined in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.
accrued liabilities for trade promotion activities we promote our products with advertising, trade promotions and consumer incentives. these programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives. we expense advertising costs and other direct marketing expenses as incurred. we recognize the costs of trade promotion and consumer incentive activities as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. these estimates are based on our analysis of the programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends and our experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs offered in the past.
our trade promotional costs totaled $1,125.5 million, $995.7 million and $949.3 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. differences between estimated expense and actual program performance are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period and are normally not significant. over the three-year period ended december 31, 2014, actual promotional costs have not deviated from the estimated amount for a given year by more than approximately 3%.
pension and other post-retirement benefits plans we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans. the primary plans are the hershey company retirement plan and the hershey company retirement plan for hourly employees, which are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most u.s. employees hired prior to january 1, 2007. we also sponsor two primary other post-employment benefit ("opeb") plans, consisting of a health care plan and life insurance plan for retirees. the health care plan is contributory, with participants' contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory.
for accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and opeb plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations.
the net periodic benefit costs relating to our pension and opeb plans were as follows:
for the years ended december 31,                                                        2014              2013              2012
interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of net loss          (1.9   )          11.2              16.7
curtailment and settlement loss (credit)                                               -              (0.4   )          19.7
net periodic pension benefit cost                                                  $25.2             $43.3             $68.5
opeb plans net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost                                    $13.0             $12.5             $15.1
(1) we believe that the service cost and amortization of prior service cost components of net periodic pension benefit cost reflect the ongoing operating cost of our pension plans, particularly since our most significant plans were closed to most new entrants after 2007.
actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans' obligations. we only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of a respective plan's projected benefit obligation, or the fair market value of assets, if greater. the estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2015 is $32.3 million. the 2014 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was $23.4 million. projections beyond 2014 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets.
the weighted-average assumptions for our pension and opeb plans were as follows:
benefit obligation discount rate      3.7   %       4.5   %     3.7   %
expected return on plan assets        7.0   %      7.75   %     8.0   %
benefit obligation discount rate      3.7   %       4.5   %     3.7   %
to determine the expected return on our pension plan assets, we consider the current asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets. the historical average return over the 27 years prior to december 31, 2014 was approximately 8.7%. the actual return on assets was 8.4%, 16.7% and 13.2% for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class. the current estimated asset return is based upon the following targeted asset allocation for our domestic pension plans:
target allocation range asset class                          2014             2013
equity securities                         40% - 60%             55% - 75%
debt securities                           40% - 60%             25% - 45%
cash and certain other investments          0% - 5%               0% - 5%
our expected return on plan assets has been reduced to reflect the lower proportion of plan assets allocated to equity securities.
sensitivity of assumptions since pension and opeb liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. the discount rate used for our pension and opeb plans is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the estimated payouts of the plans. a 100 basis point decline in the weighted average pension discount rate would increase net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $4.5 million. a decrease in the opeb discount rate by 100 basis points would decrease annual opeb expense by approximately $1.3 million. for the opeb plans, a decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a decrease in benefit cost because of the lower interest cost, which would more than offset the impact of the lower discount rate assumption on the post-retirement benefit obligation.
the expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since certain of our defined benefit pension plans are partially funded. for 2015, we reduced the expected rate of return assumption to 6.3% from the 7.0% assumption used in 2014, to reflect the revised target equity allocation of 50%. the process for setting the expected rates of return is described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. a 100 basis point decrease or increase in the rate of return for pension assets would correspondingly increase or decrease annual net periodic pension benefit expense by approximately $10.6 million.
for year-end 2014, we adopted the society of actuaries updated rp-2014 mortality tables with mp-2014 generational projection scales; however, adoption of these tables did not have a significant impact on our pension obligations or net period benefit cost since our primary plans are cash balance plans and most participants take lump-sum settlements upon retirement.
funding we fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by erisa, federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the pension protection act of 2006. we fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. for 2014 and 2013, minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material. however, we made contributions of $29.4 million in 2014 and $32.3 million in 2013, including $22.0 million in 2014 and $25.0 million in 2013 to improve the funded status of our domestic plans as well as contributions to pay benefits under our non-qualified pension plans in both years. these contributions were fully tax deductible. for 2015, minimum funding requirements for our pension plans are approximately $1.1 million and we expect to make additional contributions of approximately $23.6 million to improve the funded status of our domestic plans.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. our annual impairment tests are conducted at the beginning of the fourth quarter. our 2014 analysis excluded goodwill and other intangible assets related to the sgm acquisition that was completed on september 26, 2014, just prior to our annual testing date.
we use a two-step process to quantitatively evaluate goodwill for impairment. in the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record. in the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). we compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference. we test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value with the book values of each asset.
we determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income approach. under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value. our estimates of future cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth and profitability, and cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending. additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates, estimated
discount rates, which may be risk-adjusted for the operating market of the reporting unit, and estimated royalty rates that would be charged for comparable branded licenses. we believe such assumptions also reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar valuation purposes. such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.
at december 31, 2014, the book value of our goodwill totaled $793 million and related to six reporting units (including sgm which was excluded from 2014 testing as noted above). the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value was at least 50% for each of our tested reporting units, with the exception of our india reporting unit, whose estimated fair value approximated its carrying value. as a result and given the sensitivity of the india impairment analysis to changes in the underlying assumptions, we performed a step two analysis which indicated a goodwill impairment of $11.4 million. our 2014 annual test of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in a $4.5 million pre-tax write-down of a trademark, also associated with the india business. these impairment charges were recorded in the fourth quarter.
we also have intangible assets, consisting primarily of certain trademarks, customer-related intangible assets and patents obtained through business acquisitions, that are expected to have determinable useful lives. the costs of finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. our estimates of the useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets consider judgments regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. we conduct impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these finite-lived assets may not be recoverable. undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. if an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the assets.
no additional impairments were indicated by the results of our annual testing in 2014 or 2013. however, in connection with the anticipated sale of our mauna loa business (as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, we recorded estimated impairment charges totaling $18.5 million to write-down goodwill and an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, based on the valuation of these assets as implied by the agreed-upon sales price.
commodities futures and options contracts as discussed in note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, we use derivative financial instruments to manage a number of our market risks. specifically, we use commodities futures and options contracts, in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities, to manage our commodity price risk, which represents a significant market risk exposure for us. because commodity costs comprise a significant portion of our cost of sales, we typically apply hedge accounting to our commodity derivative instruments to enable us to reduce the effect of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs.
in order to qualify for hedge accounting, a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period. we must formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item, as well as our risk management objectives, strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness. we must also maintain certain operational processes and controls that support the conduct of our commodities hedging program. additionally, since these are typically hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that the forecasted transactions will occur. if it is no longer probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will occur, we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings.
because we generally designate these commodity future and option contracts as derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships, our mark-to-market gains (losses) deferred to accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") and reclassified from aoci were as follows:
for the years ended december 31,                                                               2014              2013              2012
in millions of dollars net gains (losses) deferred to aoci for commodity cash flow hedging derivatives          $(11.2   )         $84.7             $12.8
gains (losses) reclassified from aoci to earnings                                          68.5              (8.4   )         (90.9   )
hedge ineffectiveness gains recognized in income, before tax                                2.5               3.2               0.7
income taxes we base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our company and interpretation of tax laws. we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally resolved. from time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. we maintain reserves for such assessments.
we apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. future changes in judgments and estimates related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such change. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most likely outcome. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. we adjust these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash. favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. valuation allowances are recorded for deferred income taxes when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. valuation allowances are primarily associated with temporary differences related to advertising and promotions, as well as tax loss carryforwards from operations in various foreign tax jurisdictions.

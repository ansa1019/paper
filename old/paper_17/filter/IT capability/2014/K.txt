item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition.
we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our global four-year efficiency and effectiveness program (project k).
in november 2013, the company announced a global four-year efficiency and effectiveness program (project k). the successful implementation of project k presents significant organizational design and infrastructure challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations, suppliers, business partners, and other stakeholders. in addition, the project may not advance our business strategy as expected. as a result, we may not be able to
implement project k as planned, including realizing, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits from our program. events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the program, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. any failure to implement project k in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, the complexity of project k will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. our management team must successfully implement administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of project k. these and related demands on our resources may divert the organizations attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and financial or other systems, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. as a result our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.
our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, including agricultural commodities, fuel and labor.
agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, soybean oil, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us. the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, climate change or other unforeseen circumstances. to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes, the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected. in addition, we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials. our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase, resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings.
cereal processing ovens at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by natural gas or propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. short-term stand-by propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies. oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants. in addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.
a shortage in the labor pool, failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements, or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.
our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees. we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, active health care, severance and other postemployment benefits. we also participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations. our major pension plans and u.s. retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate and other investments. the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets, a change in the weighted-average discount rate used to measure obligations, the rate or trend of health care cost inflation, and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements. many of our employees are covered by collectively-bargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectively-bargained agreements. strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms, which could adversely impact our operating results. the terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency.
multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business.
we participate in various multiemployer pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees. we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans,
then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plans funding of vested benefits. in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan, and in that event, we could face a withdrawal liability. some multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities. such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability.
we operate in the highly competitive food industry.
we face competition across our product lines, including ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions. most of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and competition with them in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, or lose category share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products.
we may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. in addition, the loss of one of our largest customers could negatively impact our sales and profits.
our largest customer, wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 21% of consolidated net sales during 2014, comprised principally of sales within the united states. at january 3, 2015, approximately 19% of our consolidated receivables balance and 28% of our u.s. receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates. no other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2014. during 2014, our top five customers, collectively, including wal-mart, accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 47% of u.s. net sales. as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger, our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. if we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected. the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits.
our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.
we have a number of iconic brands with significant value. maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. the growing use of social and digital media by consumers, kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about kellogg, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation, regardless of the informations accuracy. the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. brand recognition can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs, as well as our use of social media. if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted.
tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
the company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the companys subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various foreign jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes possible u.s. tax reform and contemplated changes in the uk and other countries of long-standing tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.
we are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the u.s. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and
penalties. there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
the cash we generate outside the u.s. is principally to be used to fund our international development. if the funds generated by our u.s. business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the u.s., we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the u.s. such international earnings would be subject to u.s. tax which could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase.
we also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. the enactment of or increases in tariffs, including value added tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in markets in which we are currently active, or may be active in the future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.
if our food products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result.
selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks, including product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded. we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. moreover, even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands.
we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.
disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our ability, including manufacturing or distribution capabilities, and that of our suppliers, business partners and contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities, or other reasons, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.
evolving tax, environmental, food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, labeling, trade, food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.
our activities or products, both in and outside of the united states, are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and government agencies, including the u.s. food and drug administration, u.s. federal trade commission, the u.s. departments of agriculture, commerce and labor, as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states, international accords and treaties and others, including voluntary regulation by other bodies. in addition, legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed, and less certain. these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements. those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety, ingredients, advertising, product or production requirements, labeling, import or export of our products or ingredients, relations with distributors and retailers, health and safety, the environment, and restrictions on the use of government programs, such as supplemental nutritional assistance program, to purchase certain of our products. we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, tax, anticorruption standards, advertising and claims, and environmental matters. the need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax, environmental, food quality and safety, labeling or other laws or regulations, or new, evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, may have
a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. further, if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, termination of necessary licenses or permits, or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations, it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation.
our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results.
we hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the euro, british pound, australian dollar, canadian dollar, mexican peso, venezuelan bolivar fuerte and russian ruble. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into u.s. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. consequently, changes in the value of the u.s. dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.
if we pursue strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
from time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. with respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns, expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges, or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis. with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges. companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business.
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil, criminal or regulatory actions, including under general, commercial, employment, environmental, food quality and safety, anti-trust and trade, advertising and claims, and environmental laws and regulations, or in asserting its rights under various laws. for example, our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs. in addition, we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements. the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us, and new legal requirements, cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations.
our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes.
there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole. these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products.
our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes. we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research, development and technology process functions of our business, we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets.
our postretirement benefit-related costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets, changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions.
increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect
our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation, the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and post-retirement plan assets, potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations, and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and post-retirement plan assets assumptions. u.s. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. the companys accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets and interest rates. in addition, funding requirements for our plans may become more significant. however, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and post-retirement funding obligations.
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity. as of january 3, 2015, we had total debt of approximately $7.4 billion and total kellogg company equity of $2.8 billion.
                          impairing the ability to access global capital markets to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward or if a rating organization announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade;
   a downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly our short-term credit rating, would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue, increase our commercial paper borrowing costs, or both;
   restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions or our business;
              requiring a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available to us for other purposes such as expansion through acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchasing shares, marketing spending and expansion of our product offerings; and
   causing us to be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions, the availability of, and interest rates on, short-term financing, and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
our performance is affected by general economic and political conditions and taxation policies.
customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession, financial and credit market disruptions, or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations. our results in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by changes in general economic and political conditions in the united states and other countries, including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business, the financial markets through which we access capital and currency, political unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business.
current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers. this could result in reductions in sales of our products, reduced acceptance of innovations, and increased price competition. deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and increased volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business, which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers, including our suppliers, co-manufacturers and distributors. a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management. any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.
the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. the carrying
value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, trade names, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date. goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. if carrying value exceeds current fair value, the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings. factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) higher commodity prices; (iii) lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition; and (iv) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events. should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected.
as of january 3, 2015, the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately $7.3 billion, of which $5.0 billion was goodwill and $2.3 billion represented trademarks, tradenames, and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of $15.1 billion and total kellogg company equity of $2.8 billion.
we must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands.
in nearly all of our product categories, we compete with well-branded products as well as retailer and other economy brands. our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors products or if consumers perceive this type of change. if consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands, then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings, which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.
we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives.
our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities. ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production, procurement, or logistical changes and these, as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.
technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.
we increasingly rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. for example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs. information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations. furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between, and storage of personal data of, our personnel, customers, consumers and suppliers depends on information technology. our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. moreover, our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber- or phishing-attacks. these events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage. furthermore, if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm. to date, we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security. while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems.
our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.
we consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, or our technology, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.
we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands or products. any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products.
we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally.
we are a global company and generated 39% of our 2014 and 2013 net sales, and 37% of our 2012 net sales outside the united states. we manufacture our products in 20 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries, so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations. those risks include:
   compliance with u.s. laws affecting operations outside of the united states, such as ofac trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations,
   compliance with anti-corruption laws, including u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and u.k. bribery act (ukba),
   compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple regimes,
   changes in tax laws, interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes,
   fluctuations in currency values, especially in emerging markets,
   changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls,
   increased sovereign risk, such as default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments,
   varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights,
   design and implementation of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base, and
   imposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our sales or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales.
in addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. we could also be adversely impacted by continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states. all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks.
our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets. however, some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets. in many countries outside of the united states, particularly those with emerging economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach, such as the fcpa and the ukba, or local anti-bribery laws. these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials, including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities. our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy. if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political, economic and currency volatility, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations kellogg company and subsidiaries results of operations business overview the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company, our operations and our present business environment. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report.
for more than 100 years, consumers have counted on kellogg for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. kellogg is the worlds leading producer of cereal, second largest producer of cookies and crackers, and a leading producer of savory snacks and frozen foods. additional product offerings include toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks and veggie foods. kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally.
we manage our operations through eight operating segments that are based on product category or geographic location. these operating segments are evaluated for similarity with regards to economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environments to determine if they can be aggregated into reportable segments. we report results of operations in the following reportable segments: u.s. morning foods; u.s. snacks; u.s. specialty; north america other; europe; latin america; and asia pacific. the reportable segments are discussed in greater detail in note 16 within notes to consolidated financial statements.
we manage our company for sustainable performance defined by our long-term annual growth targets. in february 2015 we announced a change to our long-term annual growth target for comparable net sales. our targeted long-term annual growth for comparable net sales is now low-single-digit (1 to 3%). this target was previously 3 to 4%. our long-term annual growth targets continue to be mid-single-digit (4 to 6%) for comparable operating profit, and high-single-digit (7 to 9%) for currency-neutral comparable diluted net earnings per share.
during 2013, we announced project k, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program. the program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings, once all phases are approved and implemented, that will be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. we expect that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash flow. see the restructuring and cost reduction activities section for more information.
comparability comparability of certain financial measures is impacted significantly by several types of charges or benefits such as pringles integration costs, pension and commodity mark-to-market adjustments, project k costs, differences in shipping days, and other costs impacting comparability. to provide increased transparency and assist in understanding our comparable operating performance, we use non-gaap financial measures within md&a that exclude the impact of these charges or benefits.
these non-gaap financial measures include comparable net sales, comparable gross margin, comparable gross profit, comparable sga%, comparable operating margin, comparable operating profit, comparable income taxes, comparable effective tax rate, comparable net income attributable to kellogg company, comparable basic earnings per share (eps), comparable diluted eps, and comparable diluted eps growth.
the currency-neutral comparable eps and currency-neutral comparable eps growth non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, in addition to pringles integration costs, pension and commodity mark-to-market adjustments, project k costs, differences in shipping days, and other costs impacting comparability.
the comparable net sales growth and comparable operating profit growth non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, in addition to foreign currency translation, pringles integration costs, pension and commodity mark-to-market adjustments, project k costs, differences in shipping days, and other costs impacting comparability.
financial results for the full year 2014, our reported net sales decreased by 1.4% and comparable net sales decreased by 2.0%. we experienced comparable net sales declines in our developed cereal businesses and our u.s. snacks business. comparable net sales grew in latin america and asia pacific. reported operating profit declined by 63.9% and comparable operating profit declined by 3.9%. the decline in comparable operating profit was driven by reduced sales, lower production volume and higher distribution costs. this was partially offset by discipline in overhead control and reduced incentive compensation to align with performance.
reported diluted eps of $1.75 was down 64.6% compared to the prior year of $4.94. comparable diluted eps of $3.81 was down 1.0% compared to the prior year of $3.85 and was in line with our expectations.

u.s. morning foods comparable net sales for u.s. morning foods declined 5.7% as a result of unfavorable volume and pricing/mix. this segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages.
the cereal category continued to decline through the year despite our continued investments behind category-building programs that started early in the year. much of our decline in the cereal category has come from special k® and kashi®. we experienced weakness in special k® as it faced headwinds from evolving consumer trends regarding weight management. as a result, we changed the positioning of the brand from a focus on dieting to weight wellness. this focus will stress the role that special k® plays in a healthy lifestyle. we have also identified areas of focus for kashi® which is a great brand in a category that is on trend. we have begun the execution of this new positioning for the overall cereal business through the following initiatives:
   we have launched the see you at breakfast campaign and the open for breakfast digital program designed to help us connect directly with consumers
   we are revitalizing the special k® brand and are launching new products such as special k® gluten-free and special k® protein
we expect that these actions will have a positive impact on the performance of the special k® and kashi® brands, and on the cereal business as a whole. our plan for investment is long-term and the levels, content, and effectiveness of the support will evolve, and increase over time.
toaster pastries reported a sales decline for the year as a result of difficult comparisons due to the peanut butter innovations launched in 2013. however we did gain share for the year and introduced a new pb&j innovation in november and we expect this to improve sales results in 2015. health and wellness bars and beverages each reported a sales decline for the year.
comparable operating profit in u.s. morning foods declined 10.8% due to the unfavorable sales performance and a mid-single-digit increase in cereal brand-building investment. this was partially offset by a decrease in brand-building investment behind health and wellness bars and beverages, and continued cost discipline.
u.s. snacks comparable net sales in u.s. snacks declined 2.4% as a result of decreased volume partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. this segment consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks, and fruit-flavored snacks.
crackers posted a slight sales increase and gained share as a result of the continued success of cheez-it® innovations and core products in the town house®, and club® brands due to brand-building support and sales execution. cheez-it®, town house®, and club® all reported solid consumption and share gains. the gains in these three brands have been offset by weakness in special k® cracker chips due to similar consumer trends that we have experienced in the cereal category. we have addressed this weakness by launching completely restaged cracker chips with new flavors, better flavor and texture profiles, improved packaging, and new positioning. this new product started to arrive in stores in late december.
the bars business declined due to weakness in the special k® and fiber plus® brands. the issues with these brands are similar to what we have experienced in the cereal category. to address these issues we launched new products and activities in the fourth quarter of this year and will launch more new, great-tasting special k® snack bars with new packaging and new positioning. this activity ties into the initiatives we are launching in other categories and regions around the world. this new product started to arrive in stores in late december. rice krispies treats® and nutri-grain® both reported consumption gains and gained share as a result of good core growth and innovation. we expect this segment to remain challenging into the first half of 2015.
the cookies business declined resulting in lost share. however we saw share gains from chips deluxe® as a result of new co-branded products. we experienced soft performance in our 100-calorie packs business throughout the year. we are migrating consumers to an expanded line of single-serve products, which should help to reduce the impact of the decline in 2015. we also experienced the negative impact of a sku rationalization initiative with impacts expected to continue into early 2015.
savory snacks reported mid-single-digit sales growth and held share for the year behind the performance of the core business, grab n go, and the new pringles® tortilla product.
comparable operating profit in u.s. snacks declined by 8.7% due to unfavorable sales performance and net cost inflation. this was partially offset by continued cost discipline.
u.s. specialty comparable net sales in u.s. specialty declined 1.4% as a result of decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. sales declines were the result of the negative impact of weather early in the year, supply issues with a co-packer, and an inventory de-load as a customer shifted from warehouse to direct delivery.
comparable operating profit in u.s. specialty declined by 1.3% due to the unfavorable sales performance. this was partially offset by cost discipline.
north america other comparable net sales in north america other (u.s. frozen and canada) declined 1.8% due to decreased volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. the u.s. frozen business reported a decline due to unfavorable comparisons early in the year resulting from strong prior-year growth behind innovation activity and costs later in the year associated with the launch of new products. new eggo® bites and eggo® handheld sandwiches performed well during the year. the combination of the eggo® handheld sandwiches and good results from our special k® handheld sandwiches resulted in a double-digit sales increase for our sandwich business during our final quarter of the year. consumption of eggo® waffles is improving as we have re-launched the leggo my eggo® brand-building program and launched eggo® gluten-free and a new variety of thick-n-fluffy waffles. canada reported a slight increase in sales driven primarily by the snacks business as volumes increased at a low single-digit rate.
comparable operating profit in north america other declined 5.2% primarily due to unfavorable sales performance. this was partially offset by continued cost discipline.
europe comparable net sales for europe declined 0.7% as a result of flat volume and unfavorable pricing/mix. cereal category consumption remains soft in most developed markets, similar to the cereal category in the u.s. emerging markets reported good growth for the year in both cereal and snacks. to address the cereal category softness, we executed brand-building activities in the second half of the year and we plan to launch new products and brand-building efforts in the first quarter of 2015. new special k® advertising has recently gone on air which addresses the recent health and wellness trends that have negatively impacted this brand.
savory snacks performed well throughout the year, with the final quarter of 2014 reporting the highest sales since we acquired the business. new products are launching, including pringles® tortilla, and we have more capacity coming on-line mid-year.
comparable operating profit in europe improved 7.8% due to net cost deflation, including strong productivity savings, and decreased brand-building investment. this was partially offset by unfavorable sales performance.
latin america latin americas comparable net sales improved 3.9% due to favorable pricing/mix which was partially offset by decreased volume. strong price realization, primarily from venezuela, has more than offset sales declines early in the year resulting from the volume elasticity impact of the introduction of a new food tax in mexico. we reported growth in venezuela, mercosur, and the pringles business as well as pricing gains in a majority of our markets. the cereal business posted good results, although we saw some competitive price promotions in mexico which affected selected segments. the momentum of the savory snacks business continues, driven by strong commercial programs, innovation, and good execution.
comparable operating profit in latin america improved by 8.5% due to favorable sales performance which was partially offset by net cost inflation, increased brand-building investment to support innovation and new programs, and increased overhead investment.
asia pacific comparable net sales in asia pacific increased 0.7% as a result of flat volume and favorable pricing/mix. the sales increase was the result of double-digit growth in the asian markets and high-single-digit growth in the savory snacks business across the region. this sales performance was partially offset by weakness in the australian cereal category and our performance in south africa as we conducted construction work early in the year and it took longer than expected to bring the plant back on line.
comparable operating profit in asia pacific declined 9.2% due to the weakness in the australian cereal category and our performance in south africa. this was partially offset by cost discipline.
corporate comparable operating profit for corporate improved as a result of reduced pension costs which was partially offset by increased overhead investments.

(e)   comparable net sales growth and comparable operating profit growth are non-gaap measures which are reconciled to the directly comparable measure in accordance with u.s. gaap within this table. we believe the use of such non-gaap measures provides increased transparency and assists in understanding our comparable operating performance.
u.s. morning foods comparable net sales for u.s. morning foods declined 1.9% as a result of unfavorable volume and flat pricing/mix. this segment consists of cereal, toaster pastries, health and wellness bars, and beverages. cereal category growth was challenging throughout the year due to the timing of innovation, weakness in the adult segment of the portfolio and reduced retailer inventories. despite this category performance, raisin bran® posted a solid consumption increase behind good innovation and advertising that resonated with consumers, and froot loops® posted consumption growth as a result of innovation launched during the year. toaster pastries reported solid growth behind innovations which resulted in consumption and share gains for the year. beverages continued to report increased consumption resulting from expanded distribution.
comparable operating profit for u.s. morning foods declined due to increased commodity costs being partially offset by overhead cost containment, reduced consumer promotion investment, and the favorable impact of lapping a 2012 product recall.
u.s. snacks comparable net sales in u.s. snacks declined by 2.9% as a result of unfavorable volume which was partially offset by favorable pricing/mix. this business consists of crackers, cereal bars, cookies, savory snacks and fruit-flavored snacks. the sales decline was the result of lower shipments in crackers, cereal bars, cookies, and fruit-flavored snacks. crackers decline was the result of special k cracker chips® lapping a strong year-ago launch. this decline was partially offset with innovations by the cheez-it® and town house® brands. sales declined in cereal bars across most brands. cereal bars reported gains in nutri-grain® and rice krispiestreats® where we invested behind innovations. cookies sales declined for the year. this was partially driven by reductions in retailer inventories and strong competitor actions resulting in weakness across many of our brands. savory snacks reported a solid sales increase for the year as pringles® consumption gains continued throughout the year.
comparable operating profit for u.s. snacks declined due to significantly increased commodity costs, being partially offset by reduced advertising investment, reduced consumer promotion investment, and overhead cost containment.
u.s. specialty comparable net sales in u.s. specialty increased by 4.1% as a result of favorable pricing/mix and volume. sales growth was due to strong results from innovation launches, expanded points of distribution, and pricing.
comparable operating profit for u.s. specialty increased due to favorable pricing, flat commodity costs, and reduced advertising investment.
north america other comparable net sales in north america other (u.s. frozen and canada) increased by 2.2% due to favorable pricing/mix and volume. sales growth was the result of our u.s. frozen business posting solid growth for the year while gaining share as a result of increased brand-building support behind innovation activity.
comparable operating profit for north america other increased due to favorable pricing and overhead cost containment which was partially offset by slight increases in commodity costs and increased brand-building investment.
europe comparable net sales in europe increased 1.7% for the year driven by increased volume and favorable pricing/mix. competitive conditions in europe remained challenging. the cereal category in the uk continued to be difficult, although new crunchy nut® granola contributed to sales and crunchy nut®, rice krispies®, and corn flakes® all gained share. we also posted sales growth in the mediterranean/middle east businesses and in russia and were pleased with results in these developing growth regions.
comparable operating profit in europe improved due to reduced investment in consumer promotions and advertising along with overhead cost containment. these benefits were partially offset by increased commodity costs.
latin america comparable net sales in latin america increased 5.5% due to a strong increase in pricing/mix partially offset by a decline in volume. latin america experienced growth in both cereal and snacks. cereal performed very well in venezuela and brazil. the snacks business growth was primarily the result of strong results from our pringles® brand.
comparable operating profit in latin americas comparable operating profit declined due to the impact of a supply disruption in our venezuela business due to the difficult operating environment and increased overhead investment. this was partially offset by favorable price realization and reduced advertising investment.
asia pacific comparable net sales in asia pacific grew 3.0% as a result of favorable volume partially offset by unfavorable pricing/mix. asia pacifics growth was driven by solid cereal performance in india, southeast asia, and japan. in addition, the snacks business reported strong performance behind the pringles® brand. the australia business experienced declines in the cereal business and gains in the snacks business.
comparable operating profit in asia pacific declined due to unfavorable price realization and increased overhead investment. this was partially offset by sales growth and reduced brand-building investment.
corporate comparable operating profit for corporate improved as a result of reduced pension costs incurred resulting from the combination of lower interest cost and higher expected return on assets for the plans.

restructuring and cost reduction activities we view our continued spending on restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our ongoing operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long-term profit growth targets. initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a five-year period of completion. upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.
project k the most recent and largest program that is currently active is project k, a four-year efficiency and effectiveness program announced in november 2013. the program is expected to generate a significant amount of savings that will be invested in key strategic areas of focus for the business. the company expects that this investment will drive future growth in revenues, gross margin, operating profit, and cash flow.
the focus of the program is to strengthen existing businesses in core markets, increase growth in developing and emerging markets, and drive an increased level of value-added innovation. the program is expected to provide a number of benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, the implementation of global business services, and a new global focus on categories.
we currently anticipate that the program will result in total pre-tax charges, once all phases are approved and implemented, of $1.2 to $1.4 billion, with after-tax cash costs, including incremental capital expenditures, estimated to be $900 million to $1.1 billion. cash expenditures, after tax and including incremental capital, of approximately $300 million have been incurred since inception of the program. total cash expenditures, as defined, are expected to be approximately $350 million in 2015 and the balance of $250 to $450 million thereafter. we currently expect the charges will consist of asset-related costs totaling $450 to $500 million which will consist primarily of asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and other exit-related costs; employee-related costs totaling $425 to $475 million which will include severance, pension and other termination benefits; and other costs totaling $325 to $425 million which will consist primarily of charges related to the design and implementation of global business capabilities. a significant portion of other costs are the result of the implementation of global business service centers which are intended to simplify and standardize business support processes. the timing and costs of these projects may change over time.
we expect annual cost savings generated from project k will be approximately $425 to $475 million by 2018, with approximately two-thirds of the cost savings to be realized in cost of goods sold. we have realized approximately $80 million of savings since the inception of the program and expect $90 to $100 million of savings in 2015, approximately two-thirds of which will come from cost of goods sold. cost savings will be reinvested into the business through additional investments in advertising, in-store execution, and in the design and quality of our products. we will also invest in production capacity in developing and emerging markets, and in global category teams.
as a result of project k, we anticipate that capital spending will be impacted at least through the end of fiscal year 2015. our current business model assumes capital spending to be approximately 3-4% of net sales annually. through the end of fiscal year 2015, capital spending is expected to be approximately 4-5% as a result of project k activities.
due to the difference in timing between expected cash costs for the project and expected future cash savings, we anticipate funding the project through a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt.

since inception of project k, we have recognized charges of $506 million that have been attributed to the program. the charges comprised of $2 million as a reduction of revenue, $326 million being recorded in cogs and $178 million recorded in sga. total charges for project k in 2015 are expected to be approximately $400 to $450 million.
all projects during 2014, we recorded $298 million of charges associated with all cost reduction initiatives. the charges were comprised of $2 million being recorded as a reduction of revenue, $152 million being recorded in cogs and $144 million recorded in sga expense.
we recorded $250 million of costs in 2013 associated with all cost reduction initiatives. the charges were comprised of $195 million being recorded in cogs and $55 million recorded in sga expense.
during 2012, we recorded $56 million of costs associated with other cost reduction initiatives. the charges were comprised of $43 million being recorded in cogs and $13 million recorded in sga expense.

employee related costs consisted of severance and pension charges. asset impairments were recorded for fixed assets that were determined to be impaired and were written down to their estimated fair value. see note 12 for more information. asset related costs consist primarily of accelerated depreciation. other costs incurred consist primarily of third-party incremental costs related to the development and implementation of global business capabilities.
at january 3, 2015 total exit cost reserves were $110 million, related to severance payments and other costs of which a substantial portion will be paid in 2015 and 2016. the following table provides details for exit cost reserves.

foreign currency translation the reporting currency for our financial statements is the u.s. dollar. certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, primarily in the euro, british pound, mexican peso, australian dollar, canadian dollar, venezuelan bolivar fuerte, and russian ruble. to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into u.s. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. as a result, increases and decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the u.s. dollar is substantial.

income taxes our reported effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 22.6%, 30.4% and 27.4% respectively. comparable effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 28.2%, 28.4%, and 28.4%, respectively. the impact of discrete adjustments on the reported effective income tax rate was a reduction of 6 percentage points for 2014, less than 1 percentage point reduction for 2013, and a reduction of 3 percentage points for 2012.
the 2014 effective income tax rate benefited from the mark-to-market loss recorded for our pension plans. the 2012 effective income tax rate benefited from the elimination of a tax liability related to certain international earnings now considered indefinitely reinvested. refer to note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon u.s. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory tax rates. additionally, the rate could be impacted if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.
we believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. however, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
as of january 3, 2015 and december 28, 2013, we had $257 million and $255 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held in international jurisdictions which will be used to fund capital and other cash requirements of international operations. these amounts include $68 million and $42 million at january 3, 2015 and december 28, 2013, respectively, subject to currency exchange controls in venezuela, limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time.
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:
operating activities                                                         $1,793                 $1,807                 $1,758
investing activities                                                           (573   )               (641   )             (3,245   )
financing activities                                                         (1,063   )             (1,141   )              1,317
effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents                            13                    (33   )                 (9   )
operating activities the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, meaning cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products.
our net cash provided by operating activities for 2014 amounted to $1,793 million, a decrease of $14 million compared with 2013. the decrease compared to the prior year is the result of the negative impact of project k cash requirements totaling $256 million, partially offset by improved performance in core working capital, which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative of approximately $210 million. our net cash provided by operating activities for 2013 amounted to $1,807 million, an increase of $49 million compared with 2012, reflecting improved performance in core and other working capital.
our cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory, excluding inventoriable mark-to-market pension costs, and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average) is relatively short, equating to approximately 27 days and 30 days for 2014 and
2013, respectively. core working capital in 2014 averaged 7.6% of net sales, compared to 7.8% in both 2013 and 2012. core working capital in 2014 showed improvements in days of inventory on hand (excluding inventoriable mark-to-market pension costs) and days of trade payables outstanding which includes the positive impact of a supplier financing initiative, partially offset by higher trade receivables.
our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $53 million, $48 million and $51 million, in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
the pension protection act (ppa), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states. we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2021 or beyond. our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa.
we currently project that we will make total u.s. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2015 of approximately $55 million. actual 2015 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher-than-expected health care claims cost experience.
we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. we use this non-gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure, as follows:
net cash provided by operating activities           $1,793               $1,807                $1,758
additions to properties                               (582   )             (637   )              (533   )
year-over-year change                                  3.5   %             (4.5   )%
the increase in cash flow (as defined) in 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to lower capital expenditures and improved core working capital partially offset by the negative impact of project k cash requirements. the decrease in cash flow in 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to higher capital expenditures.
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities for 2014 amounted to $573 million, a decrease of $68 million compared with 2013 primarily attributable to lower capital expenditures.
capital spending in 2014 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure, and to support capacity requirements in certain markets and products, including india and pringles.
net cash used in investing activities of $641 million in 2013 decreased by $2,604 million compared with 2012, due to the acquisition of pringles in 2012.
cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales has decreased to 4.0% in 2014, from 4.3% in 2013, which was an increase from 3.8% in 2012.
financing activities our net cash used by financing activities was $1,063 million and $1,141 million for 2014 and 2013, respectively compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,317 million for 2012. the use of cash in financing activities in 2014 and 2013 compared to the providing of cash from financing activities in 2012, was primarily due to the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of pringles.
in march 2014, we redeemed $150 million of our 4.00% u.s. dollar notes due 2020, $342 million of our 3.125% u.s. dollar notes due 2022 and $189 million of our 2.75% u.s. dollar notes due 2023. in connection with the debt redemption, we incurred $1 million of interest expense, offset by $8 million of accelerated gains on interest rate hedges previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and incurred $5 million expense, recorded in other income, expense (net), related to acceleration of fees on the redeemed debt and fees related to the tender offer.
in may 2014, we issued 500 million of seven-year 1.75% euro notes due 2021, using the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings.
in may 2014, we issued cdn. $300 million of three-year 2.05% canadian dollar notes due 2017, using the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay our cdn. $300 million, 2.10% notes due may 2014 at maturity.
aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of $645 million. the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including, together with cash on hand, repayment of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% u.s. dollar notes due march 2013.
in may 2012, we issued $350 million of three-year 1.125% u.s. dollar notes, $400 million of five-year 1.75% u.s. dollar notes and $700 million of ten-year 3.125% u.s. dollar notes, resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of $1.442 billion. the proceeds of these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including financing a portion of the acquisition of pringles.
in may 2012, we issued cdn. $300 million of two-year 2.10% fixed rate canadian dollar notes, using the proceeds from these notes for general corporate purposes, which included repayment of intercompany debt. this repayment resulted in cash available to be used for a portion of the acquisition of pringles.
in december 2012, we repaid $750 million five-year 5.125% u.s. dollar notes at maturity with commercial paper.
in april 2010, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $2.5 billion during 2010 through 2012. under this program, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares of common stock for $63 million during 2012.
in december 2012, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock amounting to $300 million during 2013. in april 2013, the board of directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase program expiring in april 2014. in february 2014, the board of directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in shares through december 2015. this authorization supersedes the april 2013 authorization and is intended to allow us to repurchase shares for general corporate purposes and to offset issuances for employee benefit programs. during 2014, we purchased 11 million shares totaling $690 million. in may 2013, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (asr) agreement with a financial institution counterparty and paid $355 million for the purchase of shares during the term of the agreement which extended through august 2013. the total number of shares delivered upon settlement of the asr was based upon the volume weighted average price of the companys stock over the term of the agreement. total shares purchased in 2013, including shares delivered under the asr, amounted to approximately 9 million shares totaling $544 million.
we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $1.90 per share in 2014, $1.80 per share in 2013 and $1.74 per share in 2012. total cash paid for dividends increased by 4.0% in 2014 and 5.0% in 2013. in february 2015, the board of directors declared a dividend of $.49 per common share, payable on march 18, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 6, 2015.
in february 2014, we entered into an unsecured five-year credit agreement to replace the existing unsecured four-year credit agreement, which would have expired in march 2015. the five-year credit agreement allows us to borrow, on a revolving credit basis, up to $2.0 billion.
our long-term debt agreements contain customary covenants that limit kellogg company and some of its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions. some agreements also contain change in control provisions. however, they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the u.s. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future. however, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our five-year credit agreement, which expires in february 2019. this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.
we monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements.
we are in compliance with all covenants as of january 3, 2015. we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions. this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis.

(a)   includes interest payments on our long-term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps. interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward rate curve as of january 3, 2015.
(b)   the total expected cash payments on our capital leases include interest expense totaling approximately $1 million over the periods presented above.
(c)   operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(d)                                      purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services.
the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year-end 2014, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts.
(e)   as of january 3, 2015, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $78 million, of which $9 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $69 million.
(f)                                     other long-term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at year-end 2014 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through 2020 as follows: 2015-$55; 2016-$39; 2017-$40; 2018-$41; 2019-$41; 2020-$41.
critical accounting estimates promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally insignificant and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. on a full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 0.3% of our companys net sales. however, our companys total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) are significant, so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.
property long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. management evaluates several conditions, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. for assets to be held and used, we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long-lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset. if the cash flow analysis yields an
amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data. there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses.
at january 3, 2015, we have property, plant and equipment of $3.8 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, on our balance sheet. included in this amount are approximately $79 million of idle assets.
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process. our 2012 analysis excluded goodwill and other intangible assets related to the pringles acquisition on may 31, 2012. to comply with the requirement that all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment within one year of acquisition, intangible assets recognized as part of the pringles acquisition were tested for impairment during the second quarter of 2013 in addition to the evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2013.
goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. for the 2014 goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples. our approach employs market multiples based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units. in the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value, we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows. management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units.
similarly, impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. for instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants. these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.
we also evaluate the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
at january 3, 2015, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $7.3 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and brands associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles. within this total, approximately $2.2 billion of non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite-lived, comprised principally of keebler and pringles trademarks. we currently believe that the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows. the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the u.s. snacks reporting unit was approximately 59% and 57% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. however, if we had used materially different assumptions, which we do not believe are reasonably possible, regarding the future performance of our business or a different market multiple in the valuation, this could have resulted in significant impairment losses. additionally, we have $33 million of goodwill related to our 2008 acquisition of united bakers in russia. the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of the russian reporting unit was approximately 35% in 2014 and 2013. if we used modestly different assumptions regarding sales multiples and ebitda in the valuation, this could have resulted in an impairment loss. for example, if our projection of ebitda margins had been lower by 400 basis points, this change in assumption may have resulted in impairment of some or all of the goodwill in the russian reporting unit. management will continue to monitor the situation closely.
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of u.s. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada. plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. a substantial majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of debt securities and other investments. we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. inherent in this concept is the requirement to
use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, the mortality table and improvement scale, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the united states, united kingdom and canada.
our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur. actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles.
additionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets.
to conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20-year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. our u.s. plan model, corresponding to approximately 69% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and an active management premium of 1% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis and future return expectations. although we review our expected long-term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. our expected rates of return have generally not been revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a more likely than not corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. our assumed rate of return for u.s. plans in 2015 of 8.5% equates to approximately the 57th percentile expectation of our model. similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. foreign trust investments represent approximately 31% of our global benefit plan assets.
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at january 3, 2015, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2015 benefits expense by approximately $60 million. for each of the three fiscal years, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by the following amounts (in millions): 2014-$(41); 2013-$545; 2012$211.
to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a five-year historical period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short-term future trends. in comparison to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 4.71%, our initial trend rate for 2015 of 5.00% reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. our initial rate is trended downward by 0.25% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. based on consolidated obligations at january 3, 2015, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2015 benefits expense by approximately $15 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of $169 million. a 100 basis point excess of 2015 actual health care claims cost over that calculated from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately $9 million and would increase 2015 expense by $0.4 million. any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur. the experience gain arising from recognition of 2014 claims experience was approximately $20 million.
assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. on october 27, 2014, the society of actuaries (soa) published updated mortality tables and an updated improvement scale, which both reflect improved longevity. in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of january 3, 2015, we considered the soas updated mortality tables as well as other mortality information available from the social security administration to develop assumptions aligned with our expectation of future improvement rates. the change to the mortality assumption increased the year-end pension and postretirement benefit obligations by $126 million and $33 million, respectively.
to conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using towers watsons proprietary rate:link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. rate:link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each years benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of u.s. high quality bonds. a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable. the measurement dates for our defined benefit plans are consistent with our fiscal year end. accordingly, we select discount rates to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year.
based on consolidated obligations at january 3, 2015, a 25 basis point decline in the weighted-average discount rate used for benefit plan measurement purposes would increase 2015 benefits expense by approximately $3 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $263 million. all obligation-related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.
despite the previously-described rigorous policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material differences between assumed and actual experience. during 2014, we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately $918 million compared to a net actuarial gain of approximately $1,097 million in 2013. of the total net loss recognized in 2014, approximately $911 million was related primarily to unfavorable changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions, $41 million was related to asset losses and $(34) million was related to a discrete benefit resulting from certain events affecting our benefit programs. of the $1,097 million net gain recognized in 2013, approximately $552 million was related to favorable changes in the discount rate, and $545 million of asset gains.
during 2014, we made contributions in the amount of $37 million to kelloggs global tax-qualified pension programs. this amount was mostly non-discretionary. additionally we contributed $16 million to our retiree medical programs.
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment. income taxes are provided on the portion of foreign earnings that is expected to be remitted to and taxable in the united states.
we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 11 within notes to consolidated financial statements.
accounting standards to be adopted in future periods in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued an accounting standards update (asu) which provides guidance for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. the core principle of this asu is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. to achieve that core principle, an entity would be required to apply the following five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. the asu is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2016. early adoption is not permitted. entities will have the option to apply the final standard retrospectively or use a modified retrospective method, recognizing the cumulative effect of the asu in retained earnings at the date of initial application. an entity will not restate prior periods if it uses the modified retrospective method, but will be required to disclose the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the current reporting period by the application of the asu as compared to the guidance in effect prior to the change, as well as reasons for significant changes. we will adopt the updated standard in the first quarter of 2017. we are currently evaluating the impact that implementing this
asu will have on our financial statements and disclosures, as well as whether we will use the retrospective or modified retrospective method of adoption.
future outlook we expect during 2015 that project k will enable us to begin to increase investment in certain businesses and the categories in which we compete. we expect comparable net sales growth to be approximately flat; comparable gross margin to be up slightly due to net cost deflation; comparable operating profit to decline by 2 to 4 percent; and currency-neutral comparable eps to be in a range from flat to down 2 percent.
as a result of 2014 incentive compensation being reduced to align with performance and the anticipated re-establishment of usual incentive compensation levels in 2015, we expect that increased incentive compensation will result in a 3%-4% headwind for full-year results in 2015.

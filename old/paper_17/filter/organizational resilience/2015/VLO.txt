item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, and/or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock.
our financial results are affected by volatile refining margins, which are dependent upon factors beyond our control, including the price of crude oil and the market price at which we can sell refined products.
our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other feedstocks and refined products. these in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of u.s. and international suppliers, levels of refined product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of u.s. and global economies, u.s. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs, and the extent of governmental regulation.
some of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. the longer-term effects of these and other factors on refining and marketing margins are uncertain. we do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. we may purchase our crude oil and other refinery feedstocks long before we refine them and sell the refined products. price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. a decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories.
economic turmoil and political unrest or hostilities, including the threat of future terrorist attacks, could affect the economies of the u.s. and other countries. lower levels of economic activity could result in declines in energy consumption, including declines in the demand for and consumption of our refined products, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects.
refining margins are also significantly impacted by additional refinery conversion capacity through the expansion of existing refineries or the construction of new refineries. worldwide refining capacity expansions may result in refining production capability exceeding refined product demand, which would have an adverse effect on refining margins.
a significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been cheaper than benchmark crude oils, such as louisiana light sweet (lls) and brent crude oils. these crude oil feedstock differentials vary significantly depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products, and they could decline in the future, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.
compliance with and changes in environmental laws, including proposed climate change laws and regulations, could adversely affect our performance.
the principal environmental risks associated with our operations are emissions into the air and releases into the soil, surface water, or groundwater. our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, and characteristics and composition of fuels, including gasoline and diesel. certain of these laws and regulations could impose obligations to conduct
assessment or remediation efforts at our facilities as well as at formerly owned properties or third-party sites where we have taken wastes for disposal or where our wastes have migrated. environmental laws and regulations also may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable requirements when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. if we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned.
because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, such as those relating to ghg emissions and climate change, the level of expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. current and future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could result in changes to operating permits, material changes in operations, increased capital expenditures and operating costs, increased costs of the goods we sell, and decreased demand for our products that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time. we may be required to make expenditures to modify operations or install pollution control equipment that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.
for example, the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) has, in recent years, adopted final rules making more stringent the national ambient air quality standards (naaqs) for ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, and the u.s. epa is considering further revisions to the naaqs. emerging rules and permitting requirements implementing these revised standards may require us to install more stringent controls at our facilities, which may result in increased capital expenditures. governmental regulations regarding ghg emissions-including so-called "cap-and-trade" programs targeted at reducing carbon dioxide emissions-and low carbon fuel standards could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or permitting delays for our business, and an increase in the cost of, and reduction in demand for, the products we produce, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
in addition, in 2015, the u.s., canada, and the u.k. participated in the united nations conference on climate change, which led to the creation of the paris agreement.  the paris agreement will be open for signing on april 22, 2016, and will require countries to review and "represent a progression" in their intended nationally determined contributions (which set ghg emission reduction goals) every five years beginning in 2020. restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that have been or may be imposed in various u.s. states or at the u.s. federal level or in other countries could adversely affect the oil and gas industry.
finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghg emissions in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. if any such effects were to occur, it is uncertain if they would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
disruption of our ability to obtain crude oil could adversely affect our operations.
a significant portion of our feedstock requirements is satisfied through supplies originating in the middle east, africa, asia, north america, and south america. we are, therefore, subject to the political, geographic, and economic risks attendant to doing business with suppliers located in, and supplies originating from, these areas. if one or more of our supply contracts were terminated, or if political events disrupt our traditional crude oil supply, we believe that adequate alternative supplies of crude oil would be available, but it is possible that we would be unable to find alternative sources of supply. if we are unable to obtain adequate crude oil volumes or are able to obtain such volumes only at unfavorable prices, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected, including reduced sales volumes of refined products or reduced margins as a result of higher crude oil costs.
in addition, the u.s. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in or with other countries. these restrictions, and those of other governments, could limit our ability to gain access to business opportunities in various countries. actions by both the u.s. and other countries have affected our operations in the past and will continue to do so in the future.
we are subject to interruptions and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture.
we generally use the services of third parties to transport feedstocks to our facilities and to transport the products we manufacture to market. if we experience prolonged interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver our products to market, or if the ability of the pipelines, vessels, or railroads to transport feedstocks or products is disrupted because of weather events, accidents, derailment, collision, fire, explosion, governmental regulations, or third-party actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
we may incur additional costs as a result of our use of rail cars for the transportation of crude oil and the products that we manufacture.
we currently use rail cars for the transportation of some feedstocks to certain of our facilities and for the transportation of some of the products we manufacture to their markets. we own and lease rail cars for our operations. rail transportation is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations. new laws and regulations and changes in existing laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for compliance. for example, in may 2014, the u.s. department of transportation (dot) issued an order requiring rail carriers to provide certain notifications to state agencies along routes used by trains over a certain length carrying crude oil. in addition, in november 2014, the u.s. dot issued a final rule regarding safety training standards under the rail safety improvement act of 2008. the rule required each railroad or contractor to develop and submit a training program to perform regular oversight and annual written reviews. in may 2015, the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration and the federal railroad administration issued new final rules for enhanced tank car standards and operational controls for high-hazard flammable trains. although we do not believe recently adopted rules will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, further changes in law, regulations or industry standards could require us to incur additional costs to the extent they are applicable to us.
competitors that produce their own supply of feedstocks, own their own retail sites, have greater financial resources, or provide alternative energy sources may have a competitive advantage.
the refining and marketing industry is highly competitive with respect to both feedstock supply and refined product markets. we compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined products. we do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks and, following the separation of our retail business, we do not have a company-owned retail network. many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have extensive retail sites. such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.
some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. in addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.
uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners.
our ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors that we do not control. our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. in addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders, commodity hedging counterparties, or our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. in addition, decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements.
our access to credit and capital markets also depends on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. we currently maintain investment-grade ratings by standard & poor's ratings services (s&p), moody's investors service (moody's), and fitch ratings (fitch) on our senior unsecured debt. ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. we cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. specifically, if ratings agencies were to downgrade our long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase, which could adversely affect our ability to attract potential investors and our funding sources could decrease. in addition, we may not be able to obtain favorable credit terms from our suppliers or they may require us to provide collateral, letters of credit, or other forms of security, which would increase our operating costs. as a result, a downgrade below investment grade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
from time to time, our cash needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. from time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. we have existing revolving credit facilities, committed letter of credit facilities, and an accounts receivable sales facility to provide us with available financing to meet our ongoing cash needs. in addition, we rely on the counterparties to our derivative instruments to fund their obligations under such arrangements. uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions and other counterparties to fund their commitments to us under our various financing facilities or our derivative instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
a significant interruption in one or more of our refineries could adversely affect our business.
our refineries are our principal operating assets. as a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more of our refineries were to experience a major accident or mechanical failure, be damaged by severe weather or other natural or man-made disaster, such as an act of terrorism, or otherwise be forced to shut down. if any refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs. significant interruptions in our refining system could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil feedstocks and refined products, and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate.
a significant interruption related to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
our information technology systems and network infrastructure may be subject to unauthorized access or attack, which could result in a loss of sensitive business information, systems interruption, or the disruption of our business operations. there can be no assurance that our infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans can prevent a technology systems breach or systems failure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
our business may be negatively affected by work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes by our employees, as well as new labor legislation issued by regulators.
workers at some of our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements. to the extent we are in negotiations for labor agreements expiring in the future, there is no assurance an agreement will be reached without a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action. any prolonged strike, work stoppage, or other labor action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. in addition, future federal or state labor legislation could result in labor shortages and higher costs, especially during critical maintenance periods.
we are subject to operational risks and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses arising from operating hazards. failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
our operations are subject to various hazards common to the industry, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, maritime hazards, and natural catastrophes. as protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses and liabilities. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. as a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase substantially. in some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. for example, coverage for hurricane damage is very limited, and coverage for terrorism risks includes very broad exclusions. if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
our insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies. we can make no assurances that we will be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events.
large capital projects can take many years to complete, and market conditions could deteriorate over time, negatively impacting project returns.
we may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics and level of return on the capital to be employed in the project. large-scale projects take many years to complete, and market conditions can change from our forecast. as a result, we may be unable to fully realize our expected returns, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
compliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.
we are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax
liabilities in the future. many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.
we may incur losses and incur additional costs as a result of our forward-contract activities and derivative transactions.
we currently use commodity derivative instruments, and we expect to continue their use in the future. if the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses. in addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with future regulation of derivative instruments to the extent it is applicable to us.
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership, vlp, which may involve a greater exposure to legal liability than our historic business operations.
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of vlp, a publicly traded master limited partnership. our control of the general partner of vlp may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties, including claims of conflicts of interest, related to vlp. liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
if our spin-off of cst (the "spin-off"), or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off, were determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, then we and certain of our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability.
we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service (irs) substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off, except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares, qualified as tax-free under sections 355 and 361 of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), and that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off qualified for favorable treatment. the irs did not rule, however, on whether the spin-off satisfied certain requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment under section 355 of the code. instead, the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied, and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the private letter ruling. in connection with the private letter ruling, we also obtained an opinion from a nationally recognized accounting firm, substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off qualified under sections 355 and 361 of the code. the opinion relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by cst and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. furthermore, notwithstanding the private letter ruling, the irs could determine on audit that the spin-off or the internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings we or cst have made or provided to the irs are incorrect or incomplete, or that the spin-off or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the spin-off.
if the spin-off ultimately were determined to be taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of cst common stock in the spin-off generally would be treated as receiving a spin-off of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of cst common stock received by such holder. any such spin-off would be a dividend to the extent of our current earnings and profits as of the end of 2013, and any accumulated earnings and profits. any amount that exceeded our relevant earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such holder's tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount generally being taxed as a capital gain. in addition, we would
recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of cst common stock distributed to our holders on the spin-off date over our tax basis in such shares of cst common stock. moreover, we could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities if it ultimately were determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-off were taxable.
under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with cst in connection with the spin-off, we generally are responsible for any taxes imposed on us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin-off and/or certain related internal transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment. however, if the spin-off and/or such internal transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment because of actions or failures to act by cst or its subsidiaries, cst would be responsible for all such taxes. if we were to become liable for taxes under the tax matters agreement, that liability could have a material adverse effect on us. the spin-off is more fully described in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements.

all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
overview and outlook overview for the year ended december 31, 2015, we reported net income attributable to valero stockholders from continuing operations of $4.0 billion, or $7.99 per share (assuming dilution), compared to $3.7 billion, or $6.97 per share (assuming dilution), for the year ended december 31, 2014. included in our 2015 results was a noncash charge for a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment recorded in december 2015 of $790 million ($624 million after taxes, or $1.25 per share (assuming dilution)), of which $740 million was attributable to our refining segment and $50 million was attributable to our ethanol segment. this matter is more fully described in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements. included in our 2014 results was a last-in, first-out (lifo) inventory gain of $233 million ($151 million after taxes, or $0.29 per share (assuming dilution)) primarily related to our refining segment.
our operating income increased $456 million from 2014 to 2015 as outlined by business segment in the following table (in millions):
2015                  2014                change operating income (loss) by business segment:
however, excluding the effect of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and the lifo gain discussed above, total operating income for 2015 and 2014 was $7.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, reflecting a $1.4 billion favorable increase between the years, with refining segment operating income of $7.7 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, (a favorable increase of $2.1 billion) and ethanol segment operating income of $192 million and $782 million, (an unfavorable decrease of $590 million).
the $2.1 billion increase in refining segment operating income in 2015 compared to 2014 was due to higher margins on gasoline and other refined products (e.g., petroleum coke, propane, sulfur, and lubes), partially offset by lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to brent crude oil and lower distillate margins. our ethanol segment operating income decreased $590 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower ethanol margins that resulted from lower ethanol and co-product prices, partially offset by lower corn feedstock costs.
additional details and analysis of the changes in the operating income of our business segments and other components of net income attributable to valero stockholders are provided below under "results of operations."
in march 2015, we issued $600 million of 3.65 percent senior notes due march 15, 2025 and $650 million of 4.9 percent senior notes due march 15, 2045, and our consolidated subsidiary, vlp, borrowed $200 million under its revolving credit facility (the vlp revolver), as further described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements. on july 1, 2015, vlp repaid $25 million of the amount borrowed under the vlp revolver.
on july 13, 2015, our board of directors authorized us to purchase an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock, with no expiration date to such authorization, and we had $1.3 billion remaining available under that authorization as of december 31, 2015.
effective november 24, 2015, vlp completed a public offering of 4,250,000 common units at a price of $46.25 per unit and received net proceeds from the offering of $189 million after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering costs. this transaction is further described in note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
outlook energy markets and margins were volatile during 2015, and we expect them to continue to be volatile in the 2016. below is a summary of factors that have impacted or may impact our results of operations during the first quarter of 2016:
•   gasoline margins have been volatile, but are expected to recover from seasonal lows in the near term as domestic and export demand is expected to increase. distillate margins have been negatively impacted by mild winter temperatures and are also expected to recover from their seasonal lows.
•   medium and heavy sour crude oil discounts are expected to remain wide as sour crude oil remains oversupplied. fuel oil price weakness has also put pressure on heavy sour crude oil discounts. sweet crude oil discounts are expected to remain weak on lower domestic sweet crude oil production and higher foreign sweet and sour crude oil imports.
•   a further decline in market prices of crude oil and refined products may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories.
results of operations the following tables highlight our results of operations, our operating performance, and market prices that directly impact our operations. the narrative following these tables provides an analysis of our results of operations.

(a)   cost of sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 reflects a lifo gain of $233 million ($151 million after taxes), of which $229 million is attributable to our refining segment and $4 million is attributable to our ethanol segment. these amounts have been excluded from (1) the segment and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts for the refining segment, and (2) the operating income and gross margin per gallon of production amounts for the ethanol segment.
(b)   in december 2015, we recorded a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of $790 million ($624 million after taxes), of which $740 million is attributable to our refining segment and $50 million is attributable to our ethanol segment. in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market. cost is primarily determined using the lifo inventory valuation methodology, whereby the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales in the statement of income and inventories are valued at base layer acquisition costs in the balance sheet. market is determined based on an assessment of the net realizable value of our inventory. in periods where the market price of our inventory falls below cost, we record an inventory valuation adjustment to write down the value to market in accordance with u.s. gaap. the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment for the year ended december 31, 2015 has been excluded from (1) the segment and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts for the refining segment, and (2) the gross operating income and the gross margin per gallon of production amounts for the ethanol segment. this adjustment is further discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
(c)   the lifo gain of $233 million recorded in 2014 (see note (a)) and the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of $790 million recorded in 2015 (see note (b)) are reflected in refining operating income and ethanol operating income for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, but are excluded from throughput margin per barrel and operating income per barrel for the refining segment, and from gross margin per gallon and operating income per gallon for the ethanol segment, respectively, as also described in notes (a) and (b).
(d)   throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.
general operating revenues decreased $43.0 billion (or 33 percent) and cost of sales decreased $44.3 billion (or 37 percent) for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively. despite the decrease in operating revenues, cost of sales decreased to a greater extent resulting in an increase in operating income of $456 million in 2015, with refining segment operating income increasing by $1.1 billion and ethanol segment operating income decreasing by $644 million. the reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and corporate expenses, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below.
refining refining segment operating income increased $1.1 billion from $5.9 billion in 2014 to $7.0 billion in 2015. excluding the effect of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of $740 million in 2015 and the lifo gain of $229 million in 2014, our refining segment operating income increased $2.1 billion. this increase was primarily due to a $2.1 billion (or $1.92 per barrel) increase in refining margin and a $105 million decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a $148 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.
the increase in refining margin of $2.1 billion was due primarily to the following:
•   increase in gasoline margins - we experienced an increase in gasoline margins throughout all our regions during 2015. for example, the brent-based benchmark reference margin for u.s. gulf coast cbob gasoline was $9.83 per barrel in 2015 compared to $3.54 per barrel in 2014, a favorable increase of $6.29 per barrel. another example is the ans-based reference margin for u.s. west coast carbob gasoline that was $25.56 per barrel in 2015 compared to $13.40 per barrel in 2014, a favorable increase of $12.16 per barrel. we estimate that the increase in gasoline margins per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $2.9 billion.
•   increase in other refined products margins - we experienced an increase in the margins of other refined products such as petroleum coke, propane, sulfur, and lubes in 2015 compared to 2014. margins for other refined products were higher during 2015 due to the lower cost of crude oils in 2015 compared to 2014. because the market prices for our other refined products remain relatively stable, we benefit when the cost of crude oils that we process declines. for example, the benchmark price of brent crude oil was $53.62 per barrel in 2015 compared to $99.57 per barrel in 2014. we estimate that the increase in margins for other refined products in 2015 compared to 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.6 billion.
•   lower discounts on light sweet and sour crude oils - because the market prices for refined products generally track the price of brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to brent crude oil. for 2015, the discount in the price of light sweet and sour crude oils compared to the price of brent crude oil narrowed. therefore, while we benefitted from processing crude oils priced at a discount to brent crude oil, that benefit declined in 2015 compared to 2014. for example, we processed lls crude oil (a type of light sweet crude oil) in our u.s. gulf coast region that sold at a discount of $2.37 per barrel to brent crude oil in 2015 compared
to $2.79 per barrel in 2014, representing an unfavorable decrease of $0.42 per barrel. another example is maya crude oil (a type of sour crude oil) that sold at a discount of $9.54 per barrel to brent crude oil in 2015 compared to a discount of $13.73 per barrel in 2014, representing an unfavorable decrease of $4.19 per barrel. we estimate that the narrowing of the discounts for sweet crude oils and sour crude oils that we processed during 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $260 million and $770 million, respectively.
•   lower benefit from processing other feedstocks - in addition to crude oil, we use other feedstocks and blendstocks in our refining processes, such as natural gas. when combined with steam, natural gas produces hydrogen that is used in our hydrotreater and hydrocracker processing units to produce refined products. although natural gas costs declined from 2014 to 2015, the decline was not as significant as the decline in the cost of brent crude oil; therefore, the benefit we normally derive by using natural gas as a feedstock declined. we estimate that the decline in the benefit we derived from processing other feedstocks had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $980 million in 2015 compared to 2014.
•   decrease in distillate margins - we experienced a decrease in distillate margins throughout all our regions during 2015. for example, the wti-based benchmark reference margin for u.s. mid-continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel (a type of distillate) was $19.02 per barrel in 2015 compared to $24.05 per barrel in 2014, an unfavorable decrease of $5.03 per barrel. another example is the brent-based benchmark reference margin for u.s. gulf coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was $12.64 per barrel in 2015 compared to $14.28 per barrel in 2014, an unfavorable decrease of $1.64 per barrel. we estimate that the decrease in distillate margins per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014 had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $650 million.
•   higher throughput volumes - refining throughput volumes increased by 34,000 bpd in 2015. we estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $160 million in 2015.
the decrease of $105 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a $196 million decrease in energy costs driven by lower natural gas prices ($2.58 per mmbtu in 2015 compared to $4.36 per mmbtu in 2014). this decrease in energy costs was partially offset by a $47 million increase in employee-related expenses primarily due to higher employee benefit costs and incentive compensation expenses, and a $26 million increase in costs associated with higher levels of maintenance activities in 2015.
the increase of $148 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily associated with the impact of new capital projects that began operating in 2015 and higher refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization.
ethanol ethanol segment operating income was $142 million in 2015 compared to $786 million in 2014. excluding the effect of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment of $50 million in 2015 and the lifo gain of $4 million in 2014, our ethanol segment operating income decreased $590 million. this decrease was primarily due to a $628 million (or $0.57 per gallon) decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a $39 million decrease in operating expenses.
the decrease in ethanol gross margin of $628 million was due primarily to the following:
gallon in 2015 compared to $2.37 per gallon in 2014. we estimate that the decrease in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2015 had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $800 million.
•   lower corn prices - corn prices were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to a higher domestic corn yield realized during the 2014 fall harvest (most of which is processed in the following year). for example, the chicago board of trade (cbot) corn price was $3.77 per bushel in 2015 compared to $4.16 per bushel in 2014. we estimate that the decrease in the price of corn that we processed during 2015 had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $160 million.
•   lower co-product prices - the decrease in corn prices in 2015 compared to 2014 had a negative effect on the prices we received for corn-related ethanol co-products, such as distillers grains and corn oil. we estimate that the decrease in co-product prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $40 million.
•   increased production volumes - ethanol margin was favorably impacted by increased production volumes of 405,000 gallons per day in 2015. production volumes in 2014 were negatively impacted by weather-related rail disruptions. in addition, production volumes in 2015 were positively impacted by production volumes from our mount vernon plant, which began operations in august 2014. we estimate that the increase in production volumes had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $50 million.
the $39 million decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $40 million decrease in energy costs related to lower natural gas prices ($2.58 per mmbtu in 2015 compared to $4.36 per mmbtu in 2014).
"interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest" increased by $36 million in 2015. this increase was primarily due to the impact from $1.25 billion of debt issued by valero and $200 million borrowed by vlp under the vlp revolver in 2015.
income tax expense increased $93 million in 2015. this increase was lower than expected given the increase in income from continuing operations of $419 million and was due primarily to earnings from our international operations that are taxed at statutory tax rates that are lower than in the u.s. in addition, in 2015, the u.k. statutory rate was lowered and we favorably settled various u.s. income tax audits.
the loss from discontinued operations in 2014 includes expenses of $64 million primarily related to an asset retirement obligation associated with our decision in may 2014 to abandon the aruba refinery, as further described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements.

(a)   in may 2014, we abandoned our aruba refinery, except for the associated crude oil and refined products terminal assets that we continue to operate. as a result, the refinery's results of operations have been presented as discontinued operations and the operating highlights for the refining segment and the u.s. gulf coast region exclude the aruba refinery for all years presented.this transaction is more fully described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
(b)   cost of sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 reflects a lifo gain of $233 million ($151 million after taxes), of which $229 million is attributable to our refining segment and $4 million is attributable to our ethanol segment. these amounts have been excluded from (1) the segment and regional throughput margins per barrel and the regional operating income amounts for the refining segment, and (2) the operating income and gross margin per gallon of production amounts for the ethanol segment.
(c)   on may 1, 2013, we completed the separation of our retail business. as a result and effective may 1, 2013, our results of operations no longer include those of cst, our former retail business. the nature and significance of our post-separation participation in the supply of motor fuel to cst represents a continuation of activities with cst for accounting purposes. as such, the historical results of operations related to cst have not been reported as discontinued operations in the statements of income. this transaction is more fully discussed in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
(d)   the lifo gain of $233 million recorded in 2014 (see note (b)) is reflected in refining operating income and ethanol operating income for the year ended december 31, 2014, but is excluded from throughput margin per barrel and operating income per barrel for the refining segment, and from gross margin per gallon and operating income per gallon for the ethanol segment, respectively, as also described in note (b).
(e)   throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our refining segment divided by throughput volumes. gross margin per gallon of production represents operating revenues less cost of sales of our ethanol segment divided by production volumes.
general operating revenues decreased $7.2 billion (or 5 percent) for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices in all of our regions. despite the decline in operating revenues, operating income increased $1.9 billion in 2014 due primarily to a $1.7 billion increase in refining segment operating income, a $295 million increase in ethanol segment operating income, and a $34 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an $81 million decrease in retail segment operating income due to the spin-off of our retail business in 2013 as mentioned previously. the reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments and general and administrative expenses, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below.
refining refining segment operating income increased $1.7 billion from $4.2 billion in 2013 to $5.9 billion in 2014. excluding the lifo gain of $229 million in 2014 related to our refining segment, our refining segment operating income increased by $1.4 billion. this increase was primarily due to a $1.7 billion (or $1.36 per barrel) increase in refining margin, partially offset by a $190 million increase in operating expenses and a $31 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense.
the increase in refining margin of $1.7 billion was due primarily to the following:
•   higher discounts on light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils - because the market prices for refined products generally track the price of brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to brent crude oil. for 2014, the discount in the price of some light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils compared to the price of brent crude oil widened. for example, lls crude oil processed in our u.s. gulf coast region, which is a light sweet crude oil, sold at a discount of $2.79 per barrel to brent crude oil in 2014 compared to $0.41 per barrel in 2013, representing a favorable increase of $2.38 per barrel. another example is maya crude oil, a sour crude oil, which sold at a discount of $13.73 per barrel to brent crude oil in 2014 compared to a discount of $11.31 per barrel in 2013, representing a favorable increase of $2.42 per barrel. we estimate that the discounts for light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils that we processed in 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $680 million and $800 million, respectively.
•   higher throughput volumes - refining throughput volumes increased 83,000 bpd in 2014. we estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact on our refining margin of approximately $340 million.
•   lower costs of biofuel credits - as more fully described in note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements, we purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligations under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these credits (primarily rins in the u.s.) decreased by $145 million from $517 million in 2013 to $372 million in 2014. this decrease was due primarily to a reduction in the market price of rins between the years.
•   increase in other refinery products margins - we experienced an increase in the margins of other refinery products relative to brent crude oil, such as petroleum coke and sulfur during 2014 compared to 2013. margins for other refinery products were higher during 2014 due to the decrease in the cost of crude oils during the year compared to 2013. for example, the benchmark price of brent crude oil was $99.57 per barrel in 2014 compared to $108.74 in 2013. we estimate that the increase in other refinery products margins in 2014 had a positive impact to our refining margin of approximately $430 million.
•   decrease in distillate margins - we experienced a decrease in distillate margins in our u.s. gulf coast region primarily due to the decrease in refined product prices . for example, the brent-based benchmark reference margin for u.s. gulf coast ultra-low sulfur diesel was $14.28 per barrel in 2014 compared to $15.95 per barrel in 2013, representing an unfavorable decrease of $1.67 per barrel. we estimate that the decline in distillate margins in 2014 had a negative impact to our refining margin of approximately $400 million.
the increase of $190 million in operating expenses was primarily due to a $128 million increase in energy costs related to higher natural gas prices ($4.36 per mmbtu in 2014 compared to $3.69 per mmbtu in 2013) and a $22 million increase in maintenance expense primarily related to higher levels of routine maintenance activities in 2014.
the increase of $31 million in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to additional depreciation expense of $25 million associated with the new hydrocracker unit at our st. charles refinery that began operating in july 2013.
ethanol ethanol segment operating income was $786 million in 2014 compared to $491 million in 2013. the $295 million increase in operating income was due primarily to a $399 million (or $0.29 per gallon) increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $100 million increase in operating expenses.
the increase in ethanol gross margin of $399 million was due primarily to the following:
•   lower corn prices - corn prices were lower in 2014 due to higher corn inventories in 2014 compared to 2013, which resulted from a higher yielding harvest in 2013 compared to the drought-stricken harvest of 2012. for example, the cbot corn price was $4.16 per bushel in 2014 compared to $5.80 per bushel in 2013. the decrease in the price of corn that we processed during 2014 favorably impacted our ethanol margin by approximately $910 million.
•   lower ethanol prices - ethanol prices were lower in 2014 due to higher ethanol inventories resulting from higher industry run rates in 2014 as compared to 2013. the decrease in crude oil and gasoline prices in 2014 also contributed to the decrease in ethanol prices. for example, the new york harbor ethanol price was $2.37 per gallon in 2014 compared to $2.53 per gallon in 2013. the decrease in the price of ethanol per gallon during 2014 had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $260 million.
•   lower co-product prices - the decrease in corn prices in 2014 had a negative effect on the prices we received for corn-related ethanol co-products, such as distillers grains and corn oil. the decrease in co-products prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol segment margin of approximately $250 million.
the $100 million increase in operating expenses in 2014 was partially due to $22 million in operating expenses of the mount vernon plant acquired in march 2014. the remaining increase of $78 million was primarily due to increased energy costs and chemical costs. the increase in energy costs of $57 million was due primarily to the severe winter weather in the u.s. in the first quarter of 2014 that caused a significant increase in regional natural gas prices combined with higher use of natural gas due to the increase in production volumes. the increase in chemical costs of $16 million was due to higher production volumes.
corporate expenses and other general and administrative expenses decreased $34 million in 2014 primarily due to $30 million of transaction costs in 2013 related to the separation of our retail business on may 1, 2013.
depreciation and amortization expense decreased $24 million primarily due to a $20 million loss on the sale of certain corporate property in 2013 that was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense.
"interest and debt expense, net of capitalized interest" increased $32 million in 2014. this increase was primarily due to a $48 million decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of several large capital projects during 2013, including the new hydrocracker at our st. charles refinery, partially offset by a $20 million favorable impact from a decrease in average borrowings.
income tax expense increased $523 million in 2014 due to higher income from continuing operations before income tax expense. the effective rate for both years is lower than the u.s. statutory rate because income from continuing operations from our international operations was taxed at statutory rates that were lower than in the u.s. and due to a higher benefit from our u.s. manufacturing deduction.
income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2014 includes expenses of $59 million for an asset retirement obligation and $4 million for certain contractual obligations associated with our decision in may 2014 to abandon the aruba refinery, as further described in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2015
our operations generated $5.6 billion of cash in 2015, driven primarily by net income of $4.1 billion and excluding $2.6 billion of noncash charges to income ($1.8 billion for depreciation and amortization expense and $790 million for a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment). see "results of operations" for further discussion of our operations. however, the change in working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of $1.3 billion. this use of cash was composed primarily of (i) a decrease in accounts payable, net of a decrease in receivables, of $493 million, (ii) an increase in income taxes receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable totaling $432 million, and (iii) an increase in inventories of $222 million as shown in note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the unfavorable effect of accounts payable, net of accounts receivable, was mainly due to a decrease in commodity prices from december 2014 to december 2015. the unfavorable effect in income taxes was due to tax payments associated with the settlement of several irs audits and an overpayment of taxes in 2015. this overpayment resulted from a change in the u.s. federal tax laws late in the year that reinstated the bonus depreciation deduction, which lowered our current income tax expense. the unfavorable effect in inventories was mainly due to the build in inventory volumes in 2015 as we purchased crude oil at prices we deemed favorable during the fourth quarter of 2015.
the $5.6 billion of cash generated by our operations in 2015, along with (i) $1.45 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt and (ii) net proceeds of $189 million from vlp's public offering of 4,250,000 common units as discussed in note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements, were used mainly to:
•   fund $2.5 billion of investing activities, including $2.4 billion in capital investments. capital investments are comprised of capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and joint venture investments;
•   make payments on debt and capital lease obligations of $513 million, of which $400 million related to our 4.5 percent senior notes, $75 million related to our 8.75 percent debentures, $25 million related to the vlp revolver, $10 million related to capital lease obligations, and $3 million related to other non-bank debt;
•   purchase common stock for treasury of $2.8 billion;
•   pay common stock dividends of $848 million; and
our operations generated $4.2 billion of cash in 2014, driven primarily by net income of $3.7 billion and excluding $1.7 billion of noncash charges to income (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). see "results of operations" for further discussion of our operations. however, the change in our working capital during the year had a negative impact to cash generated by our operations of $1.8 billion. this use of cash was composed primarily of a decrease in accounts receivable of $2.8 billion, which was offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $3.1 billion, a decrease in income taxes payable of $319 million, and an increase in inventories of $1.0 billion as shown in note 18 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the favorable effect in accounts receivable and the unfavorable effect in accounts payable were mainly due to a decrease in commodity prices from december 2013 to december 2014. the unfavorable effect associated with income taxes payable resulted from income tax payments exceeding income tax liabilities incurred in 2014 due to the payment of liabilities associated with prior period earnings. the unfavorable effect in inventories was mainly due to the build in inventory volumes from 2013 to 2014 as we purchased crude oil at prices we deemed favorable during the fourth quarter of 2014.
the $4.2 billion of cash provided by our operations in 2014, along with $603 million from available cash on hand, was used mainly to:
•   fund $2.8 billion of capital investments, which included capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs;
•   make debt and capital lease obligations repayments of $204 million, of which $200 million related to our 4.75 percent senior notes, and $4 million related to capital lease obligations;
•   purchase common stock for treasury of $1.3 billion; and
•   pay common stock dividends of $554 million.
capital investments we define capital investments as capital expenditures for additions to and improvements of our refining and ethanol segment assets (including turnaround and catalyst costs) and investments in joint ventures.
our operations, especially those of our refining segment, are highly capital intensive. each of our refineries comprises a large base of property assets, consisting of a series of interconnected, highly integrated and interdependent crude oil processing facilities and supporting logistical infrastructure (units), and these units are improved continuously. the cost of improvements, which consist of the addition of new units and betterments of existing units, can be significant. we have historically acquired our refineries at amounts significantly below their replacement costs, whereas our improvements are made at full replacement value. as such, the costs for improving our refinery assets increase over time and are significant in relation to the amounts we paid to acquire our refineries. we plan for these improvements by developing a multi-year capital program that is updated and revised based on changing internal and external factors.
we make improvements to our refineries in order to maintain and enhance their operating reliability, to meet environmental obligations with respect to reducing emissions and removing prohibited elements from the products we produce, or to enhance their profitability. reliability and environmental improvements generally do not increase the throughput capacities of our refineries. improvements that enhance refinery profitability may increase throughput capacity, but many of these improvements allow our refineries to process different types of crude oil and to refine crude oil into products with higher market values. therefore, many of our improvements do not increase throughput capacity significantly.
we hold investments in joint ventures and we invest in these joint ventures or enter into new joint venture arrangements to enhance our operations. in december 2015, we exercised our option to purchase a 50 percent interest in diamond pipeline llc (diamond pipeline), which was formed by plains pipeline, l.p. (plains) to construct and operate a 440-mile, 20-inch crude oil pipeline expected to provide capacity of up to 200,000 bpd of domestic sweet crude oil from the plains cushing, oklahoma terminal to our memphis refinery, with the ability to connect into the capline pipeline. the pipeline is expected to be completed in 2017 for an estimated $925 million, pending receipt of necessary regulatory approvals. we contributed $136 million upon exercise of our option and expect to invest an additional $170 million in 2016.
for 2016, we expect to incur approximately $2.6 billion for capital investments, including capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and joint venture investments. this consists of approximately $1.6 billion for stay-in-business capital and $1.0 billion for growth strategies, including our continued investment in diamond pipeline. this capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions. we continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015 are summarized below (in millions).
2016                                                                 2017                2018                2019                2020            thereafter           total debt and capitallease obligations (a)        $134                $966                 $16                $766              $1,039              $4,517            $7,438

(a)   debt obligations exclude amounts related to unamortized discount and fair value adjustments. capital lease obligations include related interest expense. these items are further described in note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
debt and capital lease obligations we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis. in july 2015, we amended our agreement to decrease the facility from $1.5 billion to $1.4 billion and extended the maturity date to july 2016. as of december 31, 2015, the actual availability under the facility fell below the facility borrowing capacity to $1.1 billion primarily due to a decrease in eligible trade receivables as a result of the ongoing decline in the market prices of the finished products that we produce. as of december 31, 2015, the amount of eligible receivables sold was $100 million. all amounts outstanding under this facility are reflected as debt.
our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. however, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows:
rating agency                            rating moody's investors service                baa2 (stable outlook)
standard &amp; poor's ratings services   bbb (stable outlook)
we cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings.
operating lease obligations our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks, refined products, and corn inventories. operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or
remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.
purchase obligations a purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies significant terms, including (i) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, (ii) fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and (iii) the approximate timing of the transaction. we have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements (such as hydrogen supply arrangements), crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and various throughput and terminalling agreements. we enter into these contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries. substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on market indices. certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. the purchase obligation amounts shown in the table above include both short- and long-term obligations and are based on (a) fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and (b) fixed or estimated prices to be paid based on current market conditions.
other long-term liabilities our other long-term liabilities are described in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements. for purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above, we made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information available as of december 31, 2015.
summary of credit facilities as of december 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued under our credit facilities as follows (in millions):

letters of credit issued as of december 31, 2015 expire in 2016 through 2018.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.
other matters impacting liquidity and capital resources stock purchase programs on july 13, 2015, our board of directors authorized us to purchase an additional $2.5 billion of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date to such authorization. this authorization was in addition to the remaining amount available under a $3 billion program previously authorized. during the third quarter of 2015, we completed our purchases under the $3 billion program. as of december 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.3 billion remaining available under the $2.5 billion program, but we have no obligation to make purchases under this program.
pension plan funding we plan to contribute approximately $36 million to our pension plans and $20 million to our other postretirement benefit plans during 2016.
environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, ghg emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future as previously discussed above in "outlook." in addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. see notes 9 and 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters.
tax matters the irs has ongoing tax audits related to our u.s. federal tax returns from 2008 through 2011, and we have received revenue agent reports (rars) in connection with the audits for tax years 2008 and 2009. we are contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the rars and continue to make progress in resolving certain of these matters with the irs. during 2015, we settled the audits related to our 2004 through 2007 tax years consistent with the recorded amounts of uncertain tax position liabilities associated with those audits. in addition, we expect to settle our audit for tax years 2008 and 2009 within the next 12 months and we believe it will be settled for amounts consistent with the recorded amounts of uncertain tax position liabilities associated with that audit. as a result, we have classified a portion of our uncertain tax position liabilities as a current liability. our net uncertain tax position liabilities, including related penalties and interest, was $391 million as of december 31, 2015. should we ultimately settle for amounts consistent with our estimates, we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand at that time to make such payments.
cash held by our international subsidiaries we operate in countries outside the u.s. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the u.s. in the form of cash dividends. should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. in addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations, as further discussed in note 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements. we believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the u.s. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. as of december 31, 2015, $1.7 billion of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries.
emissions allowances and cap-and-trade the cost to implement certain provisions of the ab 32 cap-and-trade system and low carbon fuel standard in california and the quebec cap-and-trade system are significant; however, we are recovering the majority of these costs from our customers. if we are unable to recover these costs from our customers in the future, we believe that we will have sufficient cash on hand to cover these costs.
concentration of customers our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. these concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. however, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable.
sources of liquidity we believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. we expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. however, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us.
new accounting pronouncements as discussed in note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will become effective for our financial statements in the future. the adoption of these pronouncements is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements, except as otherwise disclosed.
critical accounting policies involving critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates. the following summary provides further information about our critical accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction with note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements, which summarizes our significant accounting policies. the following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered critical due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our financial position and results of operations. we believe that all of our estimates are reasonable. unless otherwise noted, estimates of the sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions used in determining our estimates is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and contingencies involved, and the wide range of possible outcomes.
lower of cost or market inventory valuation inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. cost is principally determined under the lifo method using the dollar-value lifo approach. market value is determined based on the net realizable value of the inventories.
we compare the market value of inventories to their cost on an aggregate basis, excluding materials and supplies. in determining the market value of our inventories, we assume our refinery and ethanol feedstocks
are converted into refined products, which requires us to make estimates regarding the refined products expected to be produced from those feedstocks and the conversion costs required to convert those feedstocks into refined products. we also estimate the usual and customary transportation costs required to move the inventory from our refineries and ethanol plants to the appropriate points of sale. we then apply an estimated selling price to our inventories. if the aggregate market value is less than cost, we record a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment to reflect our inventories at market value.
the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment for the year ended december 31, 2015 is discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
property, plant, and equipment depreciation of property assets used in our refining segment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of these assets primarily using the composite method of depreciation. we maintain a separate composite group of property assets for each of our refineries. we estimate the useful life of each group based on an evaluation of the property assets comprising the group, and such evaluations consist of, but are not limited to, the physical inspection of the assets to determine their condition, consideration of the manner in which the assets are maintained, assessment of the need to replace assets, and evaluation of the manner in which improvements impact the useful life of the group. the estimated useful lives of our composite groups range primarily from 25 to 30 years.
under the composite method of depreciation, the cost of an improvement is added to the composite group to which it relates and is depreciated over that group's estimated useful life. we design improvements to our refineries in accordance with engineering specifications, design standards, and practices accepted in our industry, and these improvements have design lives consistent with our estimated useful lives. therefore, we believe the use of the group life to depreciate the cost of improvements made to the group is reasonable because the estimated useful life of each improvement is consistent with that of the group. it should be noted, however, that factors such as competition, regulation, or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting depreciation expense in the future.
impairment of assets long-lived assets and equity method investments are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. an impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
in order to test for recoverability, we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated, which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential. in order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that we deem to be reasonable.
environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating primarily to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and pollution prevention measures. future legislative action and regulatory initiatives, as discussed in note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements could result in changes to required operating permits, additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be assessed with certainty at this time.
accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental policies. however, environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties. such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and potential improvements in remediation technologies.
the amount of our accruals for environmental matters as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 are included in note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations we have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are developed from actuarial valuations. inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates. these assumptions are disclosed and described in note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements. changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control. for example, the discount rate assumption represents a yield curve comprised of various long-term bonds that have an average rating of double-a when averaging all available ratings by the recognized rating agencies, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated assuming an asset allocation that is representative of the asset mix in our pension plans. to determine the expected return on plan assets, we utilized a forward-looking model of asset returns. the historical geometric average return over the 10 years prior to december 31, 2015 was 5.69 percent. the actual return on assets for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was 1.46 percent, 7.33 percent, and 19.38 percent, respectively. these assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our financial statements. for example, a 0.25 percent decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or expected return on plan assets or a 0.25 percent increase in the assumptions related to the health care cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligation as of december 31, 2015 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending december 31, 2016 (in millions):
pension benefits      otherpostretirementbenefits increase in projected benefit obligation resulting from:
compensation rate increase                                            10              n/a health care cost trend rate increase                                 n/a           1
expected return on plan assets decrease                                5              n/a compensation rate increase                                             3              n/a health care cost trend rate increase                                 n/a              -
beginning in 2016, our net periodic benefit cost will be determined using the spot-rate approach. under this approach, our net periodic benefit cost will be impacted by the spot rates of the corporate bond yield curve used to calculate our liability discount rate. if the yield curve were to flatten entirely and our liability discount rate remained unchanged, our net periodic benefit cost would increase by $19 million for pension benefits and $3 million for other postretirement benefits in 2016.
see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.
tax matters we record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. a contingent loss related to an indirect tax (excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and/or value-added tax) claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and estimable. the recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates. actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. in addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be recovered through future taxable income. judgment is required in estimating the amount of a valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets. if our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. see notes 11 and 15 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our tax liabilities.
legal matters a variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. we record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters if we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable. the recording of such liabilities requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages.

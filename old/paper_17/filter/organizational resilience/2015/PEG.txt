item 1a. risk factors the following factors should be considered when reviewing our business. these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or net cash flows and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed elsewhere in this report.
the factors discussed in item 7. md&a may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and affect the market prices for our publicly-traded securities. while we believe that we have identified and discussed the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant.
we are exposed to commodity price volatility as a result of our participation in the wholesale energy markets.
the material risks associated with the wholesale energy markets known or currently anticipated that could adversely affect our operations include:
•   price fluctuations and collateral requirements-we expect to meet our supply obligations through a combination of generation and energy purchases. we also enter into derivative and other positions related to our generation assets and supply obligations. as a result, we are subject to the risk of price fluctuations that could affect our future results and impact our liquidity needs. these include:
•   variability in costs, such as changes in the expected price of energy and capacity that we sell into the market,
•   increases in the price of energy purchased to meet supply obligations or the amount of excess energy sold into the market,
•   variation in the relative prices of electricity and gas at the hubs within the markets,
•   the cost of fuel to generate electricity, and
•   the cost of emission credits and congestion credits that we use to transmit electricity.
in the markets where we operate, natural gas prices have a major impact on the price that generators receive for their output, especially in periods of relatively weak or strong demand. therefore, significant changes in the price of natural gas usually translate into significant changes in the wholesale price of electricity.
over the past few years, wholesale prices for natural gas have declined from the peak levels experienced in 2008. one reason for this decline is increased shale gas production as extraction technology has improved. lower gas prices have resulted in lower electricity prices, which has reduced our margins as nuclear and coal generation costs have not declined similarly. over that time, generation by our coal units was also adversely affected by the relatively lower price of natural gas as compared to coal, making it sometimes more economic to run certain of our gas units than our coal units.
natural gas prices may remain at low levels for an extended period and continue to decline if further advances in technology result in greater volumes of shale gas production. consequently, our margin may continue to be reduced as a result of sustained lower electricity prices.
many factors may affect capacity pricing in pjm, including but not limited to:
•   changes in load and demand,
•   changes in the available amounts of demand response resources,
•   changes in available generating capacity (including retirements, additions, derates, forced outage rates, etc.),
•   increases in transmission capability between zones,
•   changes to the pricing mechanism, including increasing the potential number of zones to create more pricing sensitivity to changes in supply and demand, as well as other potential changes that pjm may propose over time,
•   environmental regulation and legislation,
•   weather conditions,
•   electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and transmission disruptions, and
•   development of new fuels and new technologies for the production of power.
table of contents potential changes to the rules governing energy markets in which the output of our plants is sold also poses risk to our business, as discussed further below.
as market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, our forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts could require us to post substantial additional collateral, thus requiring us to obtain additional sources of liquidity during periods when our ability to do so may be limited. if power were to lose its investment grade credit rating, it would be required under certain agreements to provide a significant amount of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cash flows. if power had lost its investment grade credit rating as of december 31, 2015, it may have had to provide approximately $864 million in additional collateral.
•   our cost of coal and nuclear fuel may substantially increase-our coal and nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provide a substantial portion of our fuel needs over the next several years. however, it will be necessary to enter into additional arrangements to acquire coal and nuclear fuel in the future. although our fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against these market risks, future increases in our fuel costs cannot be predicted with certainty and could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. while our generation runs on diverse fuels, allowing for flexibility, the mix of fuels ultimately used can impact earnings.
•   third party credit risk-we sell generation output and buy fuel through the execution of bilateral contracts. these contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of our counterparties to meet their contractual obligations to us. any failure to perform by these counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. in the spot markets, we are exposed to the risks of the default mechanisms that exist in those markets, some of which attempt to spread the risk across all participants, which may not be an effective way of lessening the severity of the risk of the amounts at stake. the impact of economic conditions may also increase such risk.
we are subject to comprehensive and evolving regulation by federal, state and local regulatory agencies that affects, or may affect, our businesses.
we are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. changes in regulation can cause significant delays in or materially affect business planning and transactions and can materially increase our costs. regulation affects almost every aspect of our businesses, including business management, the terms and rates of transmission and distribution services, investment strategies, the financing of our operations and the payment of dividends, as well as our ability to:
•   obtain fair and timely rate relief-pse&amp;g's retail rates are regulated by the bpu and its wholesale transmission rates are regulated by ferc. the retail rates for electric and gas distribution services are established in a base rate case and remain in effect until a new base rate case is filed and concluded. as a result of our energy strong order, we are required to file our next base rate case proceeding no later than november 1, 2017. in addition, our utility has received approval for several clause recovery mechanisms, some of which provide for recovery of costs and earn returns on authorized investments. these clause mechanisms require periodic updates to be reviewed and approved by the bpu and are subject to prudency reviews. our utility's transmission rates are recovered through a ferc-approved formula rate. the revenue requirements are reset each year through this formula. the formula rate is also subject to prudency review. in addition, transmission roes have recently become the target of certain state utility commissions, municipal utilities, consumer advocates and consumer groups seeking to lower customer rates. these agencies and groups have filed complaints at ferc asking ferc to reduce the base roe of various transmission owners. they point to changes in the capital markets as justification for lowering the roe of these companies. while we are not the subject of any of these complaints, they could set a precedent for ferc-regulated transmission owners, such as pse&amp;g. inability to obtain fair or timely recovery of all our costs, including a return of or on our investments in rates, could have a material adverse impact on our business.
•   obtain required regulatory approvals-the majority of our businesses operate under mbr authority granted by ferc, which has determined that our subsidiaries do not have unmitigated market power and that mbr rules have been satisfied. failure to maintain mbr eligibility, or the effects of any severe mitigation measures that may be required if market power was evaluated differently in the future, could have a material adverse effect on us.
we may also be required to obtain various other regulatory approvals to, among other things, buy or sell assets, engage in transactions between our public utility and our other subsidiaries, and, in some cases, enter into financing arrangements, issue securities and allow our subsidiaries to pay dividends. failure to obtain these approvals on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
•   comply with regulatory requirements-there are federal standards, including mandatory nerc and critical infrastructure protection standards, in place to ensure the reliability of the u. s. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system black-outs. we have been, and will continue to be, periodically audited by the nerc for compliance and are subject to penalties for non-compliance with applicable nerc standards.
further, ferc requires compliance with all of its rules and orders, including rules concerning standards of conduct, market behavior and anti-manipulation rules, reporting, interlocking directorate rules and cross-subsidization.
in connection with an ongoing investigation by the ferc staff regarding errors in the calculation of certain components of power's cost-based bids for its new jersey fossil generating units in the pjm energy market and the quantity of energy that power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units compared to the amounts for which power was compensated in the capacity market for those units, we may incur potential disgorgement and other penalties which span a wide range depending on the success of our legal arguments. if our legal arguments do not prevail in whole or in part with ferc or in a judicial challenge that we may choose to pursue, it is likely that power would record additional losses and that such additional losses would be material to pseg's and power's results of operations in the quarterly and annual periods in which they are recorded. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
we are subject to the reporting and record-keeping requirements of the dodd-frank act, as implemented by the cftc, and may in the future be subject to cftc requirements regarding position limits for trading of certain commodities. as part of the dodd-frank act compliance, we will need to be vigilant in monitoring and reporting our swap transactions.
the bpu conducts periodic combined management/competitive service audits of new jersey utilities related to affiliate standard requirements, competitive services, cross-subsidization, cost allocation and other issues.
we may be adversely affected by changes in energy regulatory policies, including energy and capacity market design rules and developments affecting transmission.
the energy industry continues to be regulated and the rules to which our businesses are subject are always at risk of being changed. our business has been impacted by established rules that create locational capacity markets in each of pjm, iso-ne and nyiso. under these rules, generators located in constrained areas are paid more for their capacity so there is an incentive to locate in those areas where generation capacity is most needed. because much of our generation is located in constrained areas in pjm and iso-ne, the existence of these rules has had a positive impact on our revenues. pjm's locational capacity market design rules and new england forward capacity market rules have been challenged in court and continue to evolve. any changes to these rules may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in january 2011, new jersey enacted a law establishing a lcapp which provided for the construction of subsidized base load or mid-merit electric power generation. the lcapp legislation was invalidated on constitutional grounds by a federal court order issued in october 2013 and a subsequent challenge in the third circuit upheld that decision. that decision has now been filed with the u.s. supreme court for consideration on appeal. however, future state actions in new jersey and elsewhere to subsidize the construction of new generation could have the effect of artificially depressing prices in the competitive wholesale market on both a short-term and long-term basis.
we could also be impacted by a number of other events, including regulatory or legislative actions, including, among other things, direct and indirect subsidies, favoring non-competitive markets and/or technologies and energy efficiency and demand response initiatives. further, some of the market-based mechanisms in which we participate, including bgs auctions, are at times the subject of review or discussion by some of the participants in the new jersey and federal regulatory and political arenas. we can provide no assurance that these mechanisms will continue to exist in their current form, nor otherwise be modified.
to the extent that additions to the transmission system relieve or reduce congestion in eastern pjm where most of our plants are located, power's capacity and energy revenues could be adversely affected. moreover, through changes encouraged by ferc to transmission planning processes, or through rto/iso initiatives to change their planning processes, such as the recently accepted multi-driver project category in pjm, more transmission may ultimately be built to facilitate renewable generation or support other public policy initiatives. any such addition to the transmission system could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
ferc has also eliminated the rofr, which will have the effect of allowing third parties to build certain types of transmission projects in the service territories of incumbent utilities such as pse&g. as a result, we could face competitive pressures for our transmission business in new jersey, as well as in in other utilities' service territories where we will be able to seek opportunities to build. changes to ferc policies regarding transmission planning and rate treatment for transmission investment, including roes and incentive rates, could also have an impact on our transmission business. in addition, certain
table of contents pjm cost allocation determinations have been recently challenged at ferc, the resolution of which could impact costs borne by new jersey ratepayers and increase customer bills.
we are subject to numerous federal and state environmental laws and regulations that may significantly limit or affect our businesses, adversely impact our business plans or expose us to significant environmental fines and liabilities.
we are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities regarding air quality, water quality, site remediation, land use, waste disposal, the impact on global climate, natural resources damages and other matters. these laws and regulations affect the manner in which we conduct our operations and make capital expenditures. changes in these laws, or violations of existing laws, could result in significant increases in our compliance costs, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, operating costs for remediation and clean-up actions, civil penalties or damages from actions brought by third parties for alleged health or property damages. any such increase in our costs could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may also be unable to successfully recover certain of these cost increases through existing regulatory rate structures or our contracts with our customers.
delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain and maintain, any environmental permits or approvals, or delay in or failure to satisfy any applicable environmental regulatory requirements, could:
•   prevent construction of new facilities,
•   limit or prevent continued operation of existing facilities,
•   limit or prevent the sale of energy from these facilities, or
•   result in significant additional costs, each of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
in obtaining required approvals and maintaining compliance with laws and regulations, we focus on several key environmental issues, including:
•   concerns over global climate change could result in laws and regulations to limit co2 emissions or other ghg emissions produced by our fossil generation facilities-federal and state legislation and regulation designed to address global climate change through the reduction of ghg emissions could materially impact our fossil generation facilities. for example, in 2015 the epa published new rules for both new and existing power plants. we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these regulations and to continue operation of our fossil generation facilities, which could include the potential need to purchase co2 emission allowances. such expenditures could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more such facilities.
•   co2 litigation-in addition to legislative and regulatory initiatives, the outcome of certain legal proceedings regarding alleged impacts of global climate change not involving us could be material to the future liability of energy companies. if relevant federal or state common law were to develop that imposed liability upon those that emit ghgs for alleged impacts of ghgs emissions, such potential liability to our fossil generation operations could be material.
•   potential closed-cycle cooling requirements-the epa issued a proposed rule in 2011 regarding regulation of cooling water intake structures. following the receipt of extensive comments on its proposed rule, the epa finalized this rule on may 19, 2014 with an effective date of october 14, 2014. the epa did not mandate closed cycle cooling as the bta. instead, the epa set a fish impingement mortality standard that relies on a technology-based approach. under this standard, power facilities have the flexibility to select one of several options as their method of compliance. the rule also requires that entrainment bta decisions rely on site-specific analysis that includes an assessment of social costs-social benefits.
the epa has structured the rule so that each state will continue to consider renewal permits for existing power facilities on a case by case basis. in connection with the assessment of the bta of each facility that seeks permit renewal, the rule requires that facilities conduct a wide range of studies related to impingement mortality and entrainment and submit the results with their permit applications. state actions to renew permits under the provisions of this rule are ongoing at this time.
if the njdep or the cteep were to require installation of closed-cycle cooling or its equivalent at any of our salem, mercer, hudson, bridgeport, sewaren or new haven generating stations, the related increased costs and impacts would be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and would require further economic review to determine whether to continue operations or decommission any such station.
•   remediation of environmental contamination at current or formerly-owned facilities-we are subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. remediation activities
table of contents associated with our former manufactured gas plant (mgp) operations are one source of such costs. in addition, the historic operations of pseg companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the passaic and hackensack rivers are alleged by federal and state agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the passaic river/newark bay complex in violation of various statutes. the epa is also evaluating the hackensack river, a tributary to newark bay, for inclusion in the superfund program. we are also involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, the related costs of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. new jersey law places affirmative obligations on us to investigate and, if necessary, remediate contaminated property upon which we were in any way responsible for a discharge of hazardous substances, impacting the speed by which we will need to investigate contaminated properties, which could adversely impact cash flow. we cannot predict what further actions, if any, or the costs or the timing thereof, that may be required with respect to these or other natural resource damages claims. however, exposure to natural resource damages could subject us to additional potentially material liability. for a discussion of these and other environmental matters, see item 8. note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
our ownership and operation of nuclear power plants involve regulatory, financial, environmental, health and safety risks.
more than half of our total generation output each year is provided by our nuclear fleet, which comprises approximately one-third of our total owned generation capacity. for this reason, we are exposed to risks related to the continued successful operation of our nuclear facilities and issues that may adversely affect the nuclear generation industry. these include:
•   storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel-we currently use on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel. disposal of nuclear materials, including the availability or unavailability of a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel, could impact future operations of these stations. in addition, the availability of an off-site repository for spent nuclear fuel may affect our ability to fully decommission our nuclear units in the future.
•   regulatory and legal risk-the nrc may modify, suspend or revoke licenses, or shut down a nuclear facility and impose substantial civil penalties for failure to comply with the atomic energy act, related regulations or the terms and conditions of the licenses for nuclear generating facilities. as with all of our generation facilities, as discussed above, our nuclear facilities are also subject to comprehensive, evolving environmental regulation. our nuclear generating facilities are currently operating under nrc licenses that expire in 2033 through 2046.
•   operational risk-operations at any of our nuclear generating units could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. if this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. since our nuclear fleet provides approximately half of our generation output, any significant outage could result in reduced earnings as we would need to purchase or generate higher-priced energy to meet our contractual obligations.
•   nuclear incident or accident risk-accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred at nuclear stations, both in the united states and elsewhere. the consequences of an accident can be severe and may include loss of life, significant property damage and/or a change in the regulatory climate. we have nuclear units at two sites. it is possible that an accident or other incident at a nuclear generating unit could adversely affect our ability to continue to operate unaffected units located at the same site, which would further affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. an accident or incident at a nuclear unit not owned by us could also affect our ability to continue to operate our units. any resulting financial impact from a nuclear accident may exceed our resources, including insurance coverages. further, as a licensed nuclear operator subject to the price-anderson act and a member of a nuclear industry mutual insurance company, power is subject to potential retroactive assessments as a result of a nuclear incident or retroactive adverse loss experience.
in the event of non-compliance with applicable legislation, regulation and licenses, the nrc may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, and/or shut down a unit, depending on its assessment of the severity of the non-compliance. if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in each case, the amount and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the operation of our nuclear fleet are limited and may be insufficient to cover any costs we may incur.
our inability to balance energy obligations with available supply could negatively impact results.
the revenues provided by the operation of our generating stations are subject to market risks that are beyond our control. generation output will either be used to satisfy wholesale contract requirements or other bilateral contracts or be sold into competitive power markets. participants in the competitive power markets are not guaranteed any specified rate of return on their capital investments. generation revenues and results of operations are dependent upon prevailing market prices for energy,
table of contents capacity, ancillary services and fuel supply in the markets served. a decrease in prevailing market prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
our generation business frequently involves the establishment of forward sale positions in the wholesale energy markets on long-term and short-term bases. to the extent that we have produced or purchased energy in excess of our contracted obligations, a reduction in market prices could reduce profitability. conversely, to the extent that we have contracted obligations in excess of energy we have produced or purchased, an increase in market prices could reduce profitability. if the strategy we utilize to hedge our exposure to these various risks is not effective, we could incur significant losses. our market positions can also be adversely affected by the level of volatility in the energy markets that, in turn, depends on various factors, including weather in various geographical areas, short-term supply and demand imbalances, customer migration and pricing differentials at various geographic locations. these risks cannot be predicted with certainty.
increases in market prices also affect our ability to hedge generation output and fuel requirements as the obligation to post margin increases with increasing prices.
inability to successfully develop or construct generation, transmission and distribution projects within budget could adversely impact our businesses.
our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of required environmental upgrades and retrofits, construction and/or acquisition of additional generation units and transmission facilities and modernizing existing infrastructure. currently, we have several significant projects underway or being contemplated.
our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, complete these projects within budgets, on commercially reasonable terms and conditions and, in our regulated businesses, our ability to recover the related costs through rates. any delays, cost escalations or otherwise unsuccessful construction and development could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
any inability to recover the carrying amount of our assets could result in future impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
in accordance with accounting guidance, management evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate or market conditions, including prolonged periods of adverse commodity and capacity prices, could potentially indicate an asset's or group of assets' carrying amount may not be recoverable. significant reductions in our expected revenues or cash flows for an extended period of time resulting from such events could result in future asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
inability to access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or commercially reasonable terms or maintain sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed could adversely impact our business.
capital for projects and investments has been provided primarily by internally-generated cash flow and external financings. we have significant capital requirements and will need continued access to debt capital from outside sources in order to efficiently fund the construction and other cash flow needs of our businesses. the ability to arrange financing and the costs of capital depend on numerous factors including, among other things, general economic and market conditions, the availability of credit from banks and other financial institutions, investor confidence, the success of current projects and the quality of new projects.
the ability to have continued access to the credit and capital markets at a reasonable economic cost is dependent upon our current and future capital structure, financial performance, our credit ratings and the availability of capital under reasonable terms and conditions. as a result, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in obtaining re-financing for maturing debt or financing for projects and investments on acceptable terms or at all.
we face significant competition in the merchant energy markets.
our wholesale power and marketing businesses are subject to significant competition that may adversely affect our ability to make investments or sales on favorable terms and achieve our annual objectives. increased competition could contribute to a reduction in prices offered for power and could result in lower earnings. decreased competition could negatively impact results through a decline in market liquidity. some of our competitors include:
•   energy marketers,
•   banks, funds and other financial entities,
•   affiliates of other industrial companies, and
•   distributed generation.
regulatory, environmental, industry and other operational developments will have a significant impact on our ability to compete in energy markets, potentially resulting in erosion of our market share and impairment in the value of our power plants.
changes in customer usage patterns and technology could adversely impact us.
•   dsm and other efficiency efforts-dsm and other efficiency efforts aimed at changing the quantity and patterns of consumers' usage could result in a reduction in load requirements which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
•   changes in technology and/or customer behaviors-it is possible that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity, including distributed generation, such as fuel cells, micro turbines, micro grids, windmills and net-metered solar installations, to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. large customers, such as universities and hospitals, continue to explore potential micro grid installation. substantial micro grid penetration can impact energy costs, system performance and demand growth. it is also possible that electric customers may significantly decrease their electric consumption due to demand-side energy conservation programs. changes in technology and usage, such as municipal aggregation, could also alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity, which could adversely affect our financial results. advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production, increase reliance by customers on on-site generation, including solar, and changes in customer behaviors could result in decreased reliance on our system, each of which could adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position and investment opportunities.
financial market performance directly affects the asset values of our nuclear decommissioning trust funds and defined benefit plan trust funds. sustained decreases in asset value of trust assets could result in the need for significant additional funding.
the performance of the financial markets will affect the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy our future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans and to decommission our nuclear generating plants. a decline in the market value of our pension assets could result in the need for us to make significant contributions in the future to maintain our funding at sufficient levels.
we may be adversely affected by equipment failures, accidents, severe weather events or other incidents that impact our ability to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and remain competitive and could result in substantial financial losses.
the success of our businesses is dependent on our ability to continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers while minimizing service disruptions. we are also exposed to the risk of equipment failures, accidents, severe weather events, or other incidents which could result in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons or property. for instance, equipment failures in our natural gas distribution could give rise to a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions and mechanical problems, which could cause substantial financial losses and harm our reputation. pse&g operates and maintains more than 17,700 miles of distribution mains that transport gas to 1.8 million customers. pse&g also operates and maintains the largest cast iron infrastructure in any one state in the country at approximately 4,000 miles.
in addition, the physical risks of severe weather events, such as experienced from hurricane irene and superstorm sandy, and of climate change, changes in sea level, temperature and precipitation patterns and other related phenomena have further exacerbated these risks. such issues experienced at our facilities, or by others in our industry, could adversely impact our revenues, increase costs to repair and maintain our systems, subject us to potential litigation and/or damage claims, fines/penalties, and increase the level of oversight of our utility and generation operations and infrastructure through investigations or through the imposition of additional regulatory or legislative requirements. such actions could adversely affect our costs, competitiveness and future investments, which could be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flow.
table of contents acts of war or terrorism could adversely affect our operations.
our businesses and industry may be impacted by acts and threats of war or terrorism. these actions could result in increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in fuel prices which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. in addition, our infrastructure facilities, such as our generating stations, transmission and distribution facilities, could be direct or indirect targets or be affected by terrorist or other criminal activity. such events could severely disrupt our business operations and prevent us from servicing our customers. in addition, new or updated security regulations may require us to make changes to our current measures which could also result in additional expenses.
cybersecurity attacks or intrusions could adversely impact our businesses.
we own and/or operate generating stations and transmission and distribution facilities, all of which are dependent on the operation of our information technology systems. our ability to market our generation output and acquire and hedge fuel and power are also dependent on our information technology systems. our information technology systems may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, hostile technological intrusions or inadvertent disclosure of company and/or customer information or a cybersecurity attack may leverage our information technology to cause disruptions at another company. cybersecurity threats to our operations include:
•   disruption of the operation of our assets and the power grid,
•   theft of confidential company, employee, shareholder, vendor or customer information,
•   general business system and process interruption or compromise, including preventing us from servicing our customers, collecting revenues or the ability to record, process and/or report financial information correctly, and
•   breaches of vendors' infrastructures where our confidential information is stored.
if a significant cybersecurity event or breach should occur, it could result in material costs for repair and remediation, breach notification, operations and increased capital costs. such a cybersecurity incident could also cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws, regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings, regulatory fines and increased scrutiny and possible damage to our reputation and brand, resulting in a reduction in customer confidence. we devote resources to network and application security, encryption and other measures to protect our computing systems and infrastructure from unauthorized access or misuse and interface with numerous external entities to improve our cybersecurity situational awareness. however, given the ever changing nature of cybersecurity threats, there can be no assurance the security measures we have taken and will take in the future can protect us against all possible occurrences.
we may be unable to achieve, or continue to sustain, our expected levels of operating performance.
one of the key elements to achieving the results in our business plan is the ability to sustain generating operating performance and capacity factors at expected levels since our forward sales of energy and capacity assume acceptable levels of operating performance. this is especially important at our lower-cost facilities. operations at any of our plants could degrade to the point where the plant has to shut down or operate at less than full capacity. some issues that could impact the operation of our facilities are:
•   breakdown or failure of equipment, information technology, processes or management effectiveness,
•   disruptions in the transmission of electricity,
•   transportation constraints,
•   limitations which may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements, and,
•   operator error or catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, severe storms, acts of terrorism or other similar occurrences.
identifying and correcting any of these issues may require significant time and expense. depending on the materiality of the issue, we may choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning it to full capacity. in either event, to the extent that our operational targets are not met, we could have to operate higher-cost generation facilities or meet our obligations through higher-cost open market purchases. this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
table of contents an extended economic recession would likely have a material adverse effect on our businesses.
our results of operations may be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy, including low levels in the market prices of commodities. adverse conditions in the economy affect the markets in which we operate and can negatively impact our results. declines in demand for energy will reduce overall sales and cash flows, especially as customers reduce their consumption of electricity and gas. although our utility business is subject to regulated allowable rates of return, overall declines in electricity and gas sold and/or increases in non-payment of customer bills would materially adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
we may be unable to realize anticipated tax benefits or retain existing tax credits.
the deferred tax assets and tax credits of pseg, pse&g or power are evaluated for ultimate realizability. while presently not the case, a valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets if we estimate that such assets are more likely than not to be unrealizable. a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets or the monetization of tax credits can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future or the benefit of tax credits, we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
because pseg is a holding company, its ability to meet its corporate funding needs, service debt and pay dividends could be limited.
pseg is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock or membership interests of its subsidiaries and project affiliates. accordingly, all of the operations of pseg are conducted by its subsidiaries and project affiliates which are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts when due on the debt of, or to make any funds available to pseg to pay such amounts and satisfy its other corporate funding needs. these corporate funding needs include pseg's operating expenses, the payment of interest on and principal of its outstanding indebtedness and the payment of dividends on its capital stock. as a result, pseg can give no assurances that its subsidiaries and project affiliates will be able to transfer funds to pseg to meet all of these obligations.
challenges associated with retention of a qualified workforce could adversely impact our businesses.
our operations depend on the retention of a skilled workforce. the loss or retirement of key executives or other employees, including those with the specialized knowledge required to support our generation, transmission and distribution operations, could result in various operational challenges. these challenges may include the lack of appropriate replacements, the loss of institutional and industry knowledge and the increased costs to hire and train new personnel. this has the potential to become more critical over the next several years as a growing number of employees become eligible to retire.
in addition, because a significant portion of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements, our success will depend on our ability to successfully renegotiate these agreements as they expire. inability to do so may result in employee strikes or work stoppages which would disrupt our operations and could also result in increased costs.
our receipt of payment of receivables related to our domestic leveraged leases is dependent upon the credit quality and the ability of lessees to meet their obligations.
our receipt of payments of equity rent, debt service and other fees related to our leveraged lease portfolio in accordance with the lease contracts can be impacted by various factors. the factors which may impact future lease cash flow include, but are not limited to, new environmental legislation regarding air quality and other discharges in the process of generating electricity, market prices for fuel and electricity, including the impact of low gas prices on our coal generation investments, overall financial condition of lease counterparties and the quality and condition of assets under lease. if a lessee were to default, we could potentially be required to impair our current investment balances.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a)
this combined md&a is separately filed by public service enterprise group incorporated (pseg), public service electric and gas company (pse&g) and pseg power llc (power). information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf. pse&g and power each make representations only as to itself and make no representations whatsoever as to any other company.
pseg's business consists of two reportable segments, our principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are:
•   pse&amp;g, our public utility company which is engaged principally in the transmission of electricity and distribution of electricity and natural gas in certain areas of new jersey. pse&amp;g is subject to regulation by the new jersey board of public utilities (bpu) and the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc). pse&amp;g also invests in solar generation projects and has implemented energy efficiency and demand response programs in new jersey, which are regulated by the bpu, and
•   power, our multi-regional, wholesale energy supply company that integrates its generating asset operations and gas supply commitments with its wholesale energy, fuel supply and energy transacting functions primarily in the northeast and mid-atlantic united states through its principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries. power's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by ferc, the nuclear regulatory commission (nrc), the environmental protection agency (epa), and the states in which they operate.
pseg's other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: pseg energy holdings l.l.c. (energy holdings), which earns its revenues primarily from its portfolio of lease investments; pseg long island llc (pseg li), which operates the long island power authority's (lipa) transmission and distribution (t&d) system under a contractual agreement; and pseg services corporation (services), which provides us and these operating subsidiaries with certain management, administrative and general services at cost.
our business discussion in item 1. business provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. our risk factor discussion in item 1a. risk factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. the following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2015 and key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. this discussion refers to the consolidated financial statements (statements) and the related notes to consolidated financial statements (notes). this discussion should be read in conjunction with such statements and notes.
executive overview of 2015 and future outlook
2015 overview our business plan is designed to achieve growth while managing the risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices and changes in customer demand. we continue our focus on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment. these guiding principles have provided the base from which we have been able to execute our strategic initiatives, including:
•   maintaining and expanding a reliable generation fleet with the flexibility to utilize a diverse mix of fuels which allows us to respond to market volatility and capitalize on opportunities as they arise.
table of contents financial results the results for pseg, pse&g and power for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 are presented below:
our $161 million 2015 over 2014 increase in net income was due primarily to higher transmission revenues at pse&g, higher mark-to-market (mtm) gains and lower generation costs driven by lower natural gas and coal prices at power and insurance recoveries of superstorm sandy costs, primarily at power. these increases were partially offset by higher pension and other postretirement benefit (opeb) costs and lower capacity revenues and nuclear decommissioning trust (ndt) activity at power. for a more detailed discussion of our financial results, see results of operations.
during 2015, we grew earnings, maintained cash flows and sustained a strong balance sheet. we effectively deployed capital without the need for additional equity, while our solid credit ratings aided our ability to access capital and credit markets. the greater emphasis on capital spending for projects on which we receive contemporaneous returns at pse&g, our regulated utility, in recent years has yielded strong results and allowed us to increase our dividend. these actions to transition our business to meet market conditions and investor expectations reflect our multi-year, long-term approach to managing our company. our focus has been to invest capital in t&d and other infrastructure projects aimed at maintaining service reliability to our customers and bolstering our system resiliency. at power, our merchant generator, we strive to improve performance and reduce costs in order to enhance the value of our generation fleet in light of low gas prices, environmental considerations and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability.
at pse&g, in 2015 we continued to make investments and seek recovery on such investments made to improve the resiliency of our gas and electric distribution system as part of our energy strong program that was approved by the bpu in 2014. as approved, the energy strong program provides for up to $1.2 billion of investment, with cost recovery at a 9.75% rate of return on equity on the first $1.0 billion of the investment, plus associated allowance for funds used during construction, through an accelerated recovery mechanism. we will seek recovery of up to $220 million of investment in pse&g's next base rate case, which is to be filed no later than november 1, 2017.
in november 2015, the bpu approved our settlement with the bpu staff and the new jersey division of rate counsel regarding pse&g's gas system modernization program (gsmp) through which we will invest $905 million over three years to modernize pse&g's gas systems. the order provides for cost recovery at a 9.75% rate of return on equity on the first $650 million of the investment through an accelerated recovery mechanism. pse&g will seek recovery of the remaining $255 million of investment in its next base rate case. for additional information, see item 1. business-regulatory issues-state regulation.
effective january 1, 2015, pse&g's formula rate increased our annual transmission revenues by approximately $182 million. each year, we file estimated transmission revenues subject to true up with actual current year data. the true-up adjustment for 2015, which will be filed in the spring of 2016, will primarily include the impact on rate base of the extension of bonus depreciation, which was enacted after the filing was made, and is estimated to reduce our 2015 annual revenue increase by approximately $21 million. in october 2015, we filed our 2016 annual formula rate update with ferc, which will provide $146 million in increased annual transmission revenues effective january 1, 2016. our 2016 transmission revenues will be adjusted for the impact of the continued extension of bonus depreciation, which was enacted after our 2016 filing was made, and is estimated to reduce our 2016 revenues as filed by approximately $27 million.
over the past few years, these types of investments have altered our business mix to reflect a higher percentage contribution by pse&g.
during 2015, power successfully improved its performance for both nuclear and fossil operations, with continued upgrades in efficiency and output, while mitigating environmental impacts. power's results benefited from access to natural gas supplies through its existing firm pipeline transportation contracts. power manages these contracts for the benefit of pse&g's customers through the basic gas supply service (bgss) arrangement. the contracts are sized to ensure delivery of a reliable gas supply to pse&g customers on peak winter days. when pipeline capacity beyond the customers' needs is available, power can use it to
table of contents make third party sales and supply gas to its generating units in new jersey. power's strategic hedging practices and ability to use market conditions to its advantage help it to balance some of the volatility of the merchant power business.
three recent investments reflect our recognition of the value of opportunistic growth in the power business. in june 2015, we acquired a development project to construct a 755 mw gas-fired combined cycle generating station (keys energy center) in maryland with completion expected in 2018 at an estimated investment of $825 million - $875 million. in august 2015, we announced our plan to construct sewaren 7, a new 540 mw dual-fueled combined cycle generating plant in woodbridge, new jersey, scheduled to be in-service for the summer of 2018 at an estimated investment of $625 million - $675 million. the sewaren 7 plant will replace sewaren units 1, 2, 3 and 4. in february 2016, we announced our plan to build bridgeport harbor station 5 (bh5), a 485 mw gas-fired combined cycle generating plant on our existing bridgeport harbor station site in bridgeport, connecticut scheduled to be in-service for the summer of 2019 at an estimated investment of more than $550 million. these additions to our fleet expand our geographic diversity and are expected to contribute to the overall efficiency of operations.
in the pjm capacity auction held in august 2015 for the 2018-2019 delivery year, power cleared 8,634 mw of its generating capacity at an average price of $215 mw-day. the capacity that power cleared for the 2018-2019 delivery year included sewaren 7 and keys energy center generation plants. in the two prior pjm capacity auctions covering the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 delivery years, power cleared approximately 8,700 mw at average prices of $172 mw-day and $177 mw-day, respectively. in the iso-ne auction held in february 2016, power cleared bh5 at an average price of $232 mw-day for the 2019-2020 delivery year.
regulatory, legislative and other developments in our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, we closely monitor and engage with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments. transmission planning rules and wholesale power market design are of particular importance to our results and we continue to advocate for policies and rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets.
transmission planning ferc's rule under order 1000 altered the right of first refusal (rofr) previously held by incumbent utilities to build transmission within their respective service territories, creating the potential that new transmission projects in our service territory could be assigned to third parties rather than pse&g. order 1000 also presents opportunities for us to construct transmission outside of our service territory. in april 2013, pjm interconnection, l.l.c. (pjm) initiated a solicitation process to allow both incumbents and non-incumbents the opportunity to submit transmission project proposals to address identified high voltage issues at artificial island in new jersey. in august 2015, pjm awarded pse&g three components of the transmission project, estimated by pjm to cost approximately $126 million. pse&g has accepted construction responsibility, subject to reaching agreement with pjm on a reasonable cost estimate. discussions are ongoing with pjm regarding the cost estimate for pse&g's portion of the work. see item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-transmission regulation for additional information.
there are several matters pending before ferc that concern the allocation of costs associated with transmission projects being constructed by pse&g. regardless of how these proceedings are resolved, pse&g's ability to recover the costs of these projects will not be affected. however, the result of these proceedings could ultimately impact the amount of costs borne by ratepayers in new jersey and may cause increased scrutiny regarding pse&g's future capital investments. in addition, power, as a basic generation service (bgs) supplier, submits bids into the auction and obtains an obligation to provide services that include specified transmission costs. if the allocation of the costs associated with the transmission projects were to increase these transmission costs, bgs suppliers may be entitled to an adjustment. however, suppliers may not be able to recoup these adjustments immediately as they are subject to bpu approval. we do not believe that these matters will have a material effect on power's financial statements.
wholesale power market design capacity market design, including the reliability pricing model (rpm) in pjm, remains an important focus for us. in may 2014, a federal court issued a rule that vacated a ferc order in which ferc had determined that demand response (dr) providers should receive full market compensation for power and held that ferc has no jurisdiction over dr. in january 2016, the u.s. supreme court overturned the federal court's decision which removed any risk to dr's participation in the energy and capacity markets.
in a separate development of significance to the wholesale capacity market, in december 2014 pjm filed at ferc its proposal for a capacity performance (cp) product to include generators, dr and energy efficiency providers, which will be required to perform during emergency conditions, as a supplement to the base capacity product. the proposal included enhanced performance-based incentives and penalties. in june 2015, ferc conditionally accepted the proposal and the cp mechanism was implemented for the 2015 capacity auction noted above. we believe that the auction pricing adequately reflects the
table of contents increased costs that could result from operating under more stringent rules for generation availability. based on the auction results, the cp mechanism appears to have provided the opportunity for enhanced capacity market revenue streams for power, but future impacts cannot be assured. further, there may be requirements for additional investment and there are additional performance risks.
applications for rehearing of ferc's capacity performance order are pending. see item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-capacity market issues for additional information.
we have also been actively involved both through stakeholder processes and through filings at ferc in seeking improvements to the rules for setting prices for energy in the day-ahead and real-time markets administered by pjm and other system operators. a november 2015 development which we view as positive involves both a notice of proposed rulemaking on dispatch intervals and scarcity pricing and a separate order directing the system operators to submit reports on five other price formation issues. we believe that, if implemented, these changes will improve energy price formation in the future.
see item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-price formation initiatives for additional information.
an emerging issue in pjm involves the impact of subsidized existing generation on rpm market outcomes. these subsidies would likely enable the affected generators to submit reduced bids into pjm capacity markets that are not reflective of their actual costs of operation and may prevent uneconomic generating facilities from retiring. either of these conditions could artificially suppress capacity market prices, especially given that pjm's currently effective "minimum offer price rule" (mopr) would not apply to these plants because it only applies to new gas-fired units. see item 1. business-regulatory issues-federal regulation-capacity market issues for additional information.
environmental regulation we continue to advocate for the development and implementation of fair and reasonable rules by the epa and state environmental regulators. in particular, section 316(b) of the federal water pollution control act (fwpca) requires that cooling water intake structures, which are a significant part of the generation of electricity at steam-electric generating stations, reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. implementation of section 316(b) could adversely impact future nuclear and fossil operations and costs. in june 2015, the new jersey department of environmental protection (njdep) issued a draft new jersey pollutant discharge elimination system (njpdes) permit governing cooling water intake structures for salem. the draft permit does not require installation of cooling towers and allows salem to continue to operate utilizing the existing once-through cooling water system with certain required system modifications. the njdep may make revisions before issuing the final permit which is expected during the first half of 2016. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
in october 2015, the epa published the clean power plan (cpp), a greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions regulation under the clean air act (caa) for existing power plants. the regulation establishes state-specific emission targets based on implementation of the best systems of emission reduction. each state must submit a compliance plan to the epa by september 6, 2016 or seek a two-year extension to september 6, 2018. we continue to work with ferc and other federal and state regulators, as well as industry partners, to determine the potential impact of these regulations. numerous states, including new jersey and several industry groups, filed petitions for review with the d.c. court to challenge the cpp. in addition, the petitioners sought a stay of the rule. on january 21, 2016, the d.c. court declined to stay the cpp. however, on february 9, 2016, the u.s. supreme court stayed the rule pending further review of the case.
the u.s. supreme court's decision to stay the implementation of the cpp will delay deadlines for submission of state requests for extensions and final plans. if the cpp is upheld, new deadlines will need to be established and the effective date of the compliance period may be impacted. see item 1. business-environmental matters-climate change for additional information.
caa regulations governing hazardous air pollutants under the epa's maximum achievable control technology rules are also of significance; however, we believe our generation business remains well-positioned for such regulations if and when they are implemented. in addition, state environmental regulations governing emissions from power plants also have a significant impact on our operations. in the second quarter of 2015, we retired 1,545 mw of fully depreciated combustion turbine capacity that would not be able to comply with the more stringent emission standards for high electric demand day units (hedd) under the new jersey hedd regulations for nitrous oxide, which reduces our capacity revenues.
we are subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. in particular, the historic operations of pseg companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the passaic and hackensack rivers are alleged by federal and state agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the passaic river/newark bay complex in violation of various statutes. we are also currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, and the costs of any such remediation efforts could be material.
table of contents for further information regarding the matters described above as well as other matters that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, see item 1. business-environmental matters, item 3. legal proceedings, and item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
ferc compliance the ferc staff has initiated a preliminary non-public investigation regarding errors in the calculation of certain components of power's cost-based bids for its new jersey fossil generating units in the pjm energy market and the quantity of energy that power offered into the energy market for its fossil peaking units compared to the amounts for which power was compensated in the capacity market for those units. this investigation is ongoing. the amounts of potential disgorgement and other potential penalties that we may incur span a wide range depending on the success of our legal arguments. if our legal arguments do not prevail, in whole or in part with ferc or in a judicial challenge that we may choose to pursue, it is likely that power would record losses that would be material to pseg's and power's results of operations in the quarterly and annual periods in which they are recorded. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
bonus depreciation in december 2015, congress passed the protecting americans from tax hikes act of 2015 (tax act). the tax act includes an extension of the bonus depreciation rules. for federal tax purposes, bonus depreciation allows a tax deduction equal to the applicable percentage of qualifying assets that are placed in service during the applicable year. the extension of bonus depreciation associated with changes under the tax act is expected to reduce the rate of growth in pse&g's rate base given an anticipated increase in deferred taxes; it is also expected to have a significant cash benefit over the next several years. for more detailed information, refer to item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 19. income taxes.
change in accounting estimate at the end of 2015, we changed the approach used to measure future service and interest costs for pension and other post-retirement benefits. for 2015 and prior, we calculated service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. for 2016 and beyond, we have elected to calculate service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. this change does not affect the measurement of the plan obligations. as a change in accounting estimate, this change will be reflected prospectively. we estimate this will reduce 2016 pension and opeb expense by approximately $34 million and $13 million, respectively, net of amounts capitalized.
operational excellence we emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses. flexibility in our generating fleet has allowed us to take advantage of market opportunities presented during the year as we remain diligent in managing costs. in 2015, our
•   total nuclear fleet achieved an average capacity factor of 90%,
•   nuclear output increased by 3.1% and combined cycle output by 11.4%, (including record performance at the linden units 1 and 2 and the bethlehem energy center (bec) combined cycle units) as compared to the same period in 2014,
•   diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility allowed us to generate approximately 55 twh while addressing unit outages and balancing fuel availability and price volatility, and
•   utility ranked highest in electric and gas service business customer satisfaction among large utilities in the eastern united states and was recognized as the most reliable utility in the mid-atlantic region.
financial strength our financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. our financial position remained strong during 2015 as we:
•   had cash on hand of $394 million as of december 31, 2015,
•   extended the expiration dates for approximately $2.0 billion of five-year credit facilities for pseg, pse&amp;g and power from 2018 to 2020,
•   received cash federal tax benefits from the extension of bonus depreciation, and
we expect to be able to fund our transmission projects required under pjm's reliability program, energy strong distribution program, gsmp, keys energy center, sewaren 7, bh5 and other planned projects, without the issuance of new equity.
disciplined investment we utilize rigorous investment criteria when deploying capital and seek to invest in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. these areas include upgrading our energy infrastructure, responding to trends in environmental protection and providing new energy supplies in domestic markets with growing demand. in 2015, we commenced construction of the keys energy center in maryland and sewaren 7 in new jersey, each of which generating station cleared in the 2018/2019 capacity auction. in addition, we:
•   placed into service the final phase of our 500 kv susquehanna-roseland and 230 kv mickleton-gloucester-camden transmission projects,
•   secured approval to extend three energy efficiency economic stimulus subprograms to allow for additional capital expenditures and administrative expenses to provide energy efficiency assistance to hospitals, healthcare facilities and residential multi-family housing units,
•   completed installation of equipment to increase output and improve efficiency at our bergen 2 combined cycle gas unit similar to our 2014 installation at our linden plant, and
•   placed into service a 13 mw-direct current (dc) solar energy facility near waldorf, maryland, acquired and placed into service a 25 mw-dc solar energy facility near san francisco, california and acquired a 63 mw-dc solar energy project near salt lake city, utah which is expected to be in-service by the end of 2016.
in january 2016, we acquired a 26 mw-dc solar energy project in martin county, north carolina and expect commercial operation by july 2016. in february 2016, we acquired a 36 mw-dc solar energy project in larimer county, colorado and expect commercial operation by the fourth quarter of 2016.
in february 2016, we announced our plan to commence construction of bh5 in 2017, with operations expected to begin in mid-2019. see financial results above for additional information.
future outlook our future success will depend on our ability to continue to maintain strong operational and financial performance in a slow-moving economy and a cost-constrained environment with low gas prices, to capitalize on or otherwise address appropriately regulatory and legislative developments that impact our business and to respond to the issues and challenges described below. in order to do this, we must continue to:
•   successfully manage our energy obligations and re-contract our open supply positions,
•   execute our utility capital investment program, including our energy strong program, gsmp and other investments for growth that yield contemporaneous and reasonable risk-adjusted returns, while enhancing the resiliency of our infrastructure and maintaining the reliability of the service we provide to our customers,
•   effectively manage construction of our keys energy center, sewaren 7 and other generation projects,
•   advocate for measures to ensure the implementation by pjm and ferc of market design and transmission planning rules that continue to promote fair and efficient electricity markets,
•   engage multiple stakeholders, including regulators, government officials, customers and investors, and
•   successfully operate the lipa t&amp;d system and manage lipa's fuel supply and generation dispatch obligations.
table of contents for 2016 and beyond, the key issues and challenges we expect our business to confront include:
•   regulatory and political uncertainty, both with regard to future energy policy, design of energy and capacity markets, transmission policy and environmental regulation, as well as with respect to the outcome of any legal, regulatory or other proceeding, settlement, investigation or claim, applicable to us and/or the energy industry,
•   ferc staff's continuing investigation of certain of power's new jersey fossil generating unit bids in the pjm energy market,
•   uncertainty in the slowly improving national and regional economic recovery, continuing customer conservation efforts, changes in energy usage patterns and evolving technologies, which impact customer behaviors and demand,
•   the potential for continued reductions in demand and sustained lower natural gas and electricity prices, both at market hubs and the locations where we operate, and
•   delays and other obstacles that might arise in connection with the construction of our t&amp;d, generation and other development projects, including in connection with permitting and regulatory approvals.
our primary investment opportunities are in two areas: our regulated utility business and our merchant power business. we continually assess a broad range of strategic options to maximize long-term stockholder value. in assessing our options, we consider a wide variety of factors, including the performance and prospects of our businesses; the views of investors, regulators and rating agencies; our existing indebtedness and restrictions it imposes; and tax considerations, among other things. strategic options available to us include:
•   the acquisition, construction or disposition of transmission and distribution facilities and/or generation units,
•   the disposition or reorganization of our merchant generation business or other existing businesses or the acquisition of new businesses,
•   the expansion of our geographic footprint,
•   continued or expanded participation in solar, demand response and energy efficiency programs, and
•   investments in capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits, improvements to system resiliency and modernizing existing infrastructure.
there can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully develop and execute any of the strategic options noted above, or any additional options we may consider in the future. the execution of any such strategic plan may not have the expected benefits or may have unexpected adverse consequences.
results of operations years ended december 31,
(a)   power's results in 2015 include an after-tax insurance recovery for superstorm sandy of $102 million. power's 2014 and 2013 results include after-tax expenses of $17 million and $32 million, respectively, for operation and maintenance (o&amp;m) costs net of insurance recoveries in 2013, due to severe damage caused by superstorm sandy. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities.
table of contents the 2015 year-over-year increase in our net income was driven primarily by:
•   lower generation costs due to lower fuel costs, primarily reflecting lower natural gas and coal prices,
•   insurance recoveries of superstorm sandy costs, primarily at power.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   lower capacity revenues resulting from lower average auction prices coupled with lower ancillary and operating reserve revenues in the pjm region,
•   lower realized gains and higher other-than-temporary impairments related to the ndt fund, and
•   higher pension and opeb costs, net of amounts capitalized.
•   higher sales volumes under the bgss contract due to colder average temperatures in the 2014 winter heating season,
•   higher volumes of gas sold to third party customers,
•   lower o&amp;m expense at pse&amp;g and power, largely due to a reduction in pension and opeb costs, net of amounts capitalized.
these increases were partially offset by:
•   lower volumes of electricity sold under power's bgs contracts resulting from serving fewer tranches in 2014, and
•   higher generation costs due to higher fuel costs.
our results include the realized gains, losses and earnings on power's ndt fund and other related ndt activity. realized gains and losses, interest and dividend income and other costs related to the ndt fund are recorded in other income (deductions), and impairments on certain ndt securities are recorded as other-than-temporary impairments. interest accretion expense on power's nuclear asset retirement obligation (aro) is recorded in o&m expense and the depreciation related to the aro asset is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense. in 2014, we restructured portions of our ndt fund and realized a pre-tax gain of $65 million.
our results also include the after-tax impacts of non-trading mtm activity, which consist of the financial impact from positions with forward delivery dates.
the combined after-tax impact on net income for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 include the changes related to ndt fund and mtm activity shown in the chart below:

operating revenues increased $111 million due primarily to changes in delivery, clause, commodity and other operating revenues.
•   gas distribution revenues decreased $5 million due primarily to lower wnc revenue of $32 million due to more normal weather compared to the prior year, lower transitional energy facilities assessment (tefa) revenue of $22 million due to elimination of tefa tax effective january 1, 2014, lower cip related revenue of $11 million, partially offset by higher sales volumes of $54 million, and higher revenue from gprc of $6 million.
•   electric distribution revenues decreased $45 million due primarily to a $45 million decrease due to the elimination of the tefa tax in 2014, lower sales volumes of $17 million and lower cip related revenue of $5 million, partially offset by higher gprc of $22 million.
clause revenues decreased $51 million due primarily to lower sbc of $32 million and lower stc revenues of $18 million. the changes in clause revenue amounts were entirely offset by the amortization of related costs (regulatory assets) in o&m, depreciation and amortization and interest expense. pse&g does not earn margin on clause revenue collections.
commodity revenues increased $68 million due to lower electric and gas revenues. this is entirely offset with increased energy costs. pse&g earns no margin on the provision of bgs and bgss to retail customers.

operating revenues decreased $506 million due to changes in generation, gas supply and other operating revenues.
generation revenues decreased $172 million due primarily to
•   a decrease of $192 million due primarily to lower capacity revenues resulting from lower average auction prices and the retirement of older peaking units in june 2015, coupled with lower ancillary and operating reserve revenues in the pjm region, and
•   lower net revenues of $73 million due primarily to lower energy volumes sold in the new england (ne) region and lower average realized prices in the ne and new york (ny) regions, partially offset by higher energy volumes sold in the ny and pjm regions. also included in the net decrease is $22 million due to lower mtm gains in 2015.
•   partially offset by an increase of $56 million due primarily to higher volumes of electricity sold under wholesale load contracts in the pjm and ne regions coupled with higher average prices in the ne region, and
•   an increase of $37 million due primarily to higher volumes of electricity sold under the bgs contract at higher average prices.
•   a net decrease of $214 million in sales under the bgss contract, substantially comprised of lower average sales prices, and
•   a decrease of $122 million on sales to third party customers, of which $93 million was due to lower average sales prices and $29 million to lower volumes sold.
operating expenses energy costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel costs for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet power's obligation under its bgss contract with pse&g. energy costs decreased $597 million due to
•   generation costs decreased $254 million due primarily to lower fuel costs of $330 million reflecting lower average realized natural gas and coal prices and the utilization of lower volumes of oil and coal. mtm gains in 2015 as compared to mtm losses in 2014 resulted in a $66 million decrease. these decreased costs were partially offset by higher congestion costs in the pjm region of $140 million.
•   gas costs decreased $343 million mainly related to a decrease in average gas costs on both obligations under the bgss contract and sales to third parties.
table of contents operation and maintenance decreased $129 million due primarily to
•   a decrease of $145 million due to insurance recoveries received in 2015 related to superstorm sandy, and
•   a net decrease of $61 million related to our fossil plants, largely due to higher costs incurred in 2014 for planned outage costs, including maintenance and installation of upgraded technology at our linden combined cycle gas generating plant, partially offset by planned outage costs in 2015 at our bec generating plant and installation of upgraded technology at our combined cycle bergen plant,
•   partially offset by an increase of $51 million at our nuclear facilities, primarily due to higher planned outage costs at our 100%-owned hope creek and 50%-owned peach bottom 3 nuclear plants in 2015 as compared to our 57%-owned salem nuclear unit 2 in 2014, and
•   a $30 million increase due to higher pension and opeb costs, net of amounts capitalized.
other income (deductions) decreased $73 million due primarily to lower net realized gains from the ndt fund, partially offset by a $28 million insurance recovery related to superstorm sandy.
other-than-temporary impairments increased $33 million due primarily to an increase in impairments of equity securities in the ndt fund.
operating revenues increased $371 million due to changes in generation, gas supply and other operating revenues.
generation revenues increased $263 million due primarily to
•   higher revenues of $366 million due primarily to mtm gains in 2014 resulting from a decrease in prices on forward positions and higher energy volumes sold in the ny and ne regions, and
•   a net increase of $27 million due primarily to higher volumes on wholesale load contracts in the pjm region, offset in part by lower wholesale load volumes in the ne region,
•   partially offset by a decrease of $89 million due to lower volumes of electricity sold as a result of serving fewer tranches in 2014 under our bgs contracts and lower average pricing, and
•   a net decrease of $41 million due primarily to a decrease in operating reserve revenue, partially offset by higher ancillary revenue in the pjm region.
•   a net increase of $44 million in sales under the bgss contract, substantially comprised of higher sales volumes due to colder average temperatures during the 2014 winter heating season, partially offset by lower average gas prices, and
•   a net increase of $49 million due to higher sales volumes to third party customers.
other operating revenues increased $15 million due to transition fees related to fuel management and power supply management contracts with lipa.
operating expenses energy costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel costs for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet power's obligation under its bgss contract with pse&g. energy costs increased $251 million due to
•   generation costs increased $252 million due primarily to higher fuel costs, reflecting higher average realized natural gas prices, the unfavorable mtm impact from lower average natural gas prices on forward positions and the utilization of higher volumes of gas and oil. these increased costs were partially offset by lower congestion costs in the pjm region.
•   gas costs decreased $1 million related to a decrease of $137 million in average gas inventory costs, substantially offset by $136 million of higher volumes sold under the bgss contract and to third party customers due to colder average temperatures during the 2014 winter heating season.
table of contents operation and maintenance decreased $38 million due primarily to
•   lower pension and opeb costs, net of amounts capitalized of $42 million,
•   a decrease of $15 million due primarily to the outage of our 100%-owned hope creek nuclear facility in the fall of 2013, which was partially offset by the extension of our 57%-owned nuclear salem unit 2 refueling outage in 2014, and
•   a decrease of $27 million due to lower storm costs related to superstorm sandy,
•   partially offset by an increase of $40 million related primarily to higher planned outage and maintenance costs at our fossil plants, including maintenance and installation of upgraded technology at our linden combined cycle gas generating plant and outages at our keystone and hudson facilities.
other income (deductions) increased $65 million due primarily to higher realized gains from the ndt fund due to the restructuring of the portfolio in 2014.
other-than-temporary impairments increased $8 million due to an increase in impairments of the ndt fund.
interest expense increased $6 million due primarily to the issuance of a $250 million 2.45% senior note and a $250 million 4.30% senior note in november 2013, partially offset by the maturity of $300 million of 2.50% senior notes in april 2013.
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of our two direct major operating subsidiaries.
financing methodology we expect our capital requirements to be met through internally generated cash flows and external financings, consisting of short-term debt for working capital needs and long-term debt for capital investments.
pse&g's sources of external liquidity include a $600 million multi-year syndicated credit facility. pse&g's commercial paper program is the primary vehicle for meeting seasonal, intra-month and temporary working capital needs. pse&g does not engage in any intercompany borrowing or lending arrangements. pse&g maintains back-up facilities in an amount sufficient to cover the commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding. pse&g's dividend payments to pseg are consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings. pse&g's long-term financing plan is designed to replace maturities, fund a portion of its capital program and manage short-term debt balances. generally, pse&g uses either secured medium-term notes or first mortgage bonds to raise long-term capital.
pseg, power, energy holdings, pseg li and services participate in a corporate money pool, an aggregation of daily cash balances designed to efficiently manage their respective short-term liquidity needs. servco does not participate in the corporate money pool. servco's short-term liquidity needs are met through an account funded and owned by lipa.
pseg's sources of external liquidity may include the issuance of long-term debt securities and the incurrence of additional indebtedness under credit facilities. our current sources of external liquidity include multi-year syndicated credit facilities totaling $1 billion. these facilities are available to back-stop pseg's commercial paper program, issue letters of credit and for general corporate purposes. these facilities may also be used to provide support to pseg's subsidiaries. pseg's credit facilities and the commercial paper program are available to support pseg working capital needs or to temporarily fund growth opportunities in advance of obtaining permanent financing. pseg also has a $500 million term loan credit agreement that is scheduled to expire in november 2017. from time to time, pseg may make equity contributions or provide credit support to its subsidiaries.
power's sources of external liquidity include $2.6 billion of syndicated multi-year credit facilities. additionally, from time to time, power maintains bilateral credit agreements designed to enhance its liquidity position. credit capacity is primarily used to provide collateral in support of power's forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts as the market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, and to meet potential collateral postings in the event of a credit rating downgrade below investment grade. power's dividend payments to pseg are also designed to be consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings and provide sufficient financial flexibility. generally, power issues senior unsecured debt to raise long-term capital.
table of contents operating cash flows we expect our operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and shareholder dividend payments.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, our operating cash flow increased by $759 million. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our operating cash flow increased by $2 million. the net changes were primarily due to net changes from our subsidiaries as discussed below and higher tax payments in 2014 at the parent company and energy holdings.
pse&g pse&g's operating cash flow increased $292 million from $1,833 million to $2,125 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, due primarily to
•   an increase of $102 million due to higher customer billings in the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of increased usage due to weather,
•   partially offset by a decrease of $250 million related to a change in regulatory deferrals, primarily driven by the return of prior year overcollections to customers for bgss gas costs, gas wnc charges and bgs costs.
pse&g's operating cash flow increased $188 million from $1,645 million to $1,833 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to 2013, due primarily to
•   an increase of $188 million due to an increase from a net change in regulatory deferrals, primarily related to over collections of bgss gas costs, the over collection of gas revenues due to the gas wnc and gprc rate recoveries, and
•   an increase of $83 million due to decrease in employee benefit plan funding,
•   partially offset by $199 million related to higher tax payments.
power power's operating cash flow increased $281 million from $1,425 million to $1,706 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily resulting from
•   a decrease in margin deposit requirements of $144 million, and
•   a $78 million increase from net collection of counterparty receivables,
•   partially offset by an increase of $325 million in tax payments.
power's operating cash flow increased $78 million from $1,347 million to $1,425 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily resulting from
•   partially offset by increase of $87 million in payments to counterparties, and
•   a decrease of $11 million due to collection of counterparty receivables.
short-term liquidity we continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements. each of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the pseg facilities can also be used to support our subsidiaries' liquidity needs. our total credit facilities and available liquidity as of december 31, 2015 were as follows:
table of contents company/facility                                                       as of december 31, 2015
as of december 31, 2015, our credit facility capacity was in excess of our projected maximum liquidity requirements over our 12 month planning horizon. our maximum liquidity requirements are based on stress scenarios that incorporate changes in commodity prices and the potential impact of power losing its investment grade credit rating. pseg's credit facilities are available to back-stop its commercial paper program and issue letters of credit under which as of december 31, 2015, $211 million of commercial paper was outstanding. pse&g's credit facility primary use is to support its commercial paper program under which as of december 31, 2015, $153 million was outstanding. most of our credit facilities expire in 2019 and 2020. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 12. commitments and contingent liabilities and note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
long-term debt financing pse&g had $171 million of 6.75% mortgage bonds mature in january 2016.
power has $303 million of 5.32% senior notes and $250 million of 2.75% maturing in september 2016.
for a discussion of our long-term debt transactions during 2015 and into 2016, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
debt covenants our credit agreements contain maximum debt to equity ratios and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. we are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. continued compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon our future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.
in addition, under its first and refunding mortgage (mortgage), pse&g may issue new first and refunding mortgage bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and/or against retired mortgage bonds. as of december 31, 2015, pse&g's mortgage coverage ratio was 3.87 to 1 and the mortgage would permit up to approximately $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of new mortgage bonds to be issued against additions and improvements to its property.
default provisions our bank credit agreements and indentures contain various, customary default provisions that could result in the potential acceleration of indebtedness under the defaulting company's agreement. we have not defaulted under these agreements.
in particular, pseg's bank credit agreements contain provisions under which certain events, including an acceleration of material indebtedness under pse&g's and power's respective financing agreements, a failure by pse&g or power to satisfy certain final judgments and certain bankruptcy events by pse&g or power, that would constitute an event of default under the pseg bank credit agreements. under the pseg bank credit agreements, it would also be an event of default if either pse&g or power ceases to be wholly owned by pseg. the pse&g and power bank credit agreements include similar default provisions; however such provisions only relate to the respective borrower under such agreement and its subsidiaries and do not contain cross default provisions to each other. the pse&g and power bank credit agreements do not include cross default provisions relating to pseg.
ratings triggers our debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any material 'ratings triggers' that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. however, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral
table of contents requirements. in the event that we are not able to affirm representations and warranties on credit agreements, lenders would not be required to make loans.
in accordance with bpu requirements under the bgs contracts, pse&g is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. if pse&g were to lose its investment grade rating, it would be required to file a plan to assure continued payment for the bgs requirements of its customers.
fluctuations in commodity prices or a deterioration of power's credit rating to below investment grade could increase power's required margin postings under various agreements entered into in the normal course of business. power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet the required posting of collateral which would likely result from a credit rating downgrade at today's market prices.
on february 16, 2016, our board of directors approved a $0.41 per share common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2016. this reflects an indicative annual dividend rate of $1.64 per share. we expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant.
credit ratings if the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital. credit ratings shown are for securities that we typically issue. outlooks are shown for corporate credit ratings (s&p) and issuer credit ratings (moody's) and can be stable, negative, or positive. there is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if, in their respective judgments, circumstances warrant. each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies' ratings. the ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.
in may 2015, moody's published research reports on pseg, pse&g and power and the existing ratings and outlooks were unchanged. in may 2015, s&p published updated research reports and revised the outlook to stable from positive for pseg's corporate credit rating and power's senior notes. s&p also affirmed the senior unsecured rating of bbb+ at power and the mortgage bond rating of a at pse&g. in september 2015, moody's published an updated research report on pseg and revised the outlook to positive from stable. in september and october 2015, fitch published full rating reports on pseg and power leaving ratings and outlooks unchanged. in october 2015, pseg ended a contractual agreement with fitch to provide credit rating services for pseg, pse&g and power. in january 2016, s&p published updated research reports on pseg and pse&g and the existing ratings and outlooks were unchanged.
pseg outlook            positive      stable commercial paper   p2            a2
other comprehensive income for the year ended december 31, 2015, we had other comprehensive loss of $12 million on a consolidated basis. other comprehensive loss was due primarily to a $27 million decrease in net unrealized gains related to available-for-sale securities and $10 million of unrealized losses on derivative contracts accounted for as hedges, partially offset by a $25 million decrease in our consolidated liability for pension and postretirement benefits. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 20. accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax for additional information.
capital requirements it is expected that all of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from a combination of internally generated funds and external debt financing. projected capital construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for the next three years are presented in the table below. these projections include allowance for funds used during construction and interest capitalized during construction for pse&g and power, respectively. these amounts are subject to change, based on various factors. we will continue to approach non-regulated solar and other renewable investments opportunistically, seeking projects that will provide attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.

pse&g pse&g's projections for future capital expenditures include material additions and replacements to its transmission and distribution systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability. as project scope and cost estimates develop, pse&g will modify its current projections to include these required investments. pse&g's projected expenditures for the various items reported above are primarily comprised of the following:
•   transmission-investments focused on reliability improvements and replacement of aging infrastructure.
•   baseline-investments for new business, reliability improvements, and replacement of defective equipment.
•   energy strong-electric and gas distribution reliability investment program focused on system hardening and resiliency.
•   gas system modernization program-gas distribution investment program to replace aging infrastructure.
•   solar/energy efficiency-investments associated with grid-connected solar, solar loan programs, and customer energy efficiency programs.
in 2015, pse&g made $2,692 million of capital expenditures, primarily for transmission and distribution system reliability. this does not include expenditures for cost of removal, net of salvage, of $120 million, which are included in operating cash flows.
power power's projected expenditures for the various items listed above are primarily comprised of the following:
•   baseline-investments to replace major parts and enhance operational performance.
•   environmental/regulatory-investments made in response to environmental, regulatory or legal mandates.
•   fossil growth opportunities-investments associated with new construction, including keys energy center, sewaren 7 and bh5, and with upgrades to increase efficiency and output at combined cycle plants.
•   nuclear expansion-investments associated with certain nuclear capital projects, primarily at existing facilities designed to increase operating output.
•   solar growth opportunities-investments associated with the construction of utility-scale photovoltaic facilities.
in 2015, power made $881 million of capital expenditures, excluding $236 million for nuclear fuel, primarily related to various projects at fossil and nuclear.
disclosures about long-term maturities, contractual and commercial obligations and certain investments the following table reflects our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in the respective periods in which they are due. in addition, the table summarizes anticipated recourse and non-recourse debt maturities for the years shown. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 13. schedule of consolidated debt.
the table below does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for pension obligations due to uncertain timing of payments or liabilities for uncertain tax positions since we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of liability payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 19. income taxes for additional information.

other through energy holdings, we have investments in leveraged leases that are accounted for in accordance with gaap accounting for leases. leveraged lease investments generally involve three parties: an owner/lessor, a creditor and a lessee. in a typical leveraged lease arrangement, the lessor purchases an asset to be leased. the purchase price is typically financed 80% with debt provided by the creditor and the balance comes from equity funds provided by the lessor. the creditor provides long-term financing to the transaction secured by the property subject to the lease. such long-term financing is non-recourse to the lessor and is not presented on our consolidated balance sheets. in the event of default, the leased asset, and in some cases the lessee, secures the loan. as a lessor, energy holdings has ownership rights to the property and rents the property to the lessees for use in their business operations. for additional information, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 6. long-term investments and note 7. financing receivables.
in the event that collection of the minimum lease payments to be received by energy holdings is no longer reasonably assured, energy holdings may deem that a lessee has a high probability of defaulting on the lease obligation, and would consider the need to record an impairment of its investment. in the event the lease is ultimately rejected by a bankruptcy court, the fair value of the underlying asset and the associated debt would be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets instead of the net equity investment in the lease.
critical accounting estimates under gaap, many accounting standards require the use of estimates, variable inputs and assumptions (collectively referred to as estimates) that are subjective in nature. because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. we have determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to the respective businesses.
accounting for pensions pseg sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension plans covering pseg's and its participating affiliates' current and former employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. the market-related value of plan assets held for the qualified pension plan is equal to the fair value of these assets as of year-end. the plan assets are comprised of investments in both debt and equity securities which are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. we calculate pension costs using various economic and demographic assumptions.
assumptions and approach used: economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on trust assets. demographic assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns.
rate of return on plan assets      8.00   %      8.00   %      8.00   %
the discount rate used to calculate pension obligations is determined as of december 31 each year, our measurement date. the discount rate is determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high quality corporate bonds with similar maturities to the plan obligations. the spot rates are used to discount the estimated plan distributions. the discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same result as the full spot rate curve.
at the end of 2015, we changed the approach used to measure future service and interest costs for pension benefits. for 2015 and prior, we calculated service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. for 2016 and beyond, we have elected to calculate service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. this change does not affect the measurement of the plan obligations. as a change in accounting estimate, this change will be reflected prospectively. we estimate this will reduce 2016 pension expense by approximately $47
table of contents million or $34 million, net of amounts capitalized, as compared to the 2016 amount that would have been derived from applying our 2015 and prior years' methodology.
our expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long-term investment performance and an estimate of future long-term returns by asset class and long-term inflation assumptions.
based on the above assumptions, we have estimated net periodic pension expense in 2016 of approximately $56 million or $40 million, net of amounts capitalized.
we utilize a corridor approach that reduces the volatility of reported pension expense/income. the corridor requires differences between actuarial assumptions and plan results be deferred and amortized as part of expense/income. this occurs only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the pension benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of each year-end. the excess would be amortized over the average remaining service period of the active employees, which is approximately eight years.
effect if different assumptions used: as part of the business planning process, we have modeled future costs assuming an 8.00% rate of return and a 4.54% discount rate for 2016. actual future pension expense/income and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans.
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions. the effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption.

hedge and mtm accounting current guidance requires us to recognize the fair value of derivative instruments, not designated as normal purchases or normal sales, at their fair value on the balance sheet. many contracts qualify for normal purchases and normal sales exemption and are accounted for upon settlement.
assumptions and approach used: in general, the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined by reference to quoted market prices from contracts listed on exchanges or from brokers. some of these derivative contracts are long-term and rely on forward price quotations over the entire duration of the derivative contracts.
for a small number of contracts where quoted market prices are not available, we utilize mathematical models that rely on historical data to develop forward pricing information in the determination of fair value.
we have entered into various derivative instruments to manage risk from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. in accordance with our hedging strategy, derivatives that are hedging these risks and qualify are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. for derivatives designated as hedges, the change in the value of a derivative instrument is measured against the offsetting change in the value of the underlying contract, anticipated transaction or other business condition that the derivative instrument is intended to hedge. this is known as the measure of hedge effectiveness. changes in the fair value of the effective portion of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings. changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. any hedge ineffectiveness is included in current period earnings. during periods of extreme price volatility, there will be significant changes in the value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). as of december 31, 2015, we had no commodity contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
for our wholesale energy business, many of the forward sale, forward purchase, option and other contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but do not meet the requirements for either cash flow or fair value hedge
table of contents accounting. the changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as the related commodity prices fluctuate. as a result, our earnings may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices.
effect if different assumptions used: any significant changes to the fair market values of our derivatives instruments could result in a material change in the value of the assets or liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and could result in a material change to the unrealized gains or losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.
for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments, see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 15. financial risk management activities.
long-lived assets in accordance with gaap, management evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate or market conditions, could potentially indicate an asset's or asset group's carrying amount may not be recoverable.
assumptions and approach used: in the event certain triggers exist indicating an asset/asset group may not be recoverable, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed to determine if an impairment exists. when the carrying value of a long-lived asset/asset group exceeds the undiscounted estimate of future cash flows associated with the asset/asset group, an impairment may exist to the extent that the fair value of the asset/asset group is less than its carrying amount. these tests require significant estimates and judgment when developing expected future cash flows; however, generating units are typically evaluated at a regional portfolio level.
effect if different assumptions used: the above cash flow tests and fair value estimates may be impacted by changes in forecasted power prices, fuel costs, dispatch rates, other operating and capital expenditures and the cost of borrowing which if different, could significantly impact the outcome, triggering additional impairment tests or write-offs.
lease investments our investments in leases, included in long-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets, are comprised of lease receivables (net of non-recourse debt), the estimated residual value of leased assets, and unearned and deferred income. a significant portion of the estimated residual value of leased assets is related to merchant power plants leased to other energy companies. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 6. long-term investments and note 7. financing receivables.
assumptions and approach used: residual values are the estimated values of the leased assets at the end of the respective lease terms. the estimated values are calculated by discounting the cash flows related to the leased assets after the lease term. for the merchant power plants, the estimated discounted cash flows are dependent upon various assumptions, including:
•   estimated forward power and capacity prices in the years after the lease,
•   related prices of fuel for the plants,
•   future capital expenditures required to maintain the plants,
•   future operation and maintenance expenses, and
residual valuations are performed annually for each plant subject to lease using specific assumptions tailored to each plant. those annual valuations are compared to the recorded residual values to determine if an impairment is warranted.
effect if different assumptions used: a significant change to the assumptions, such as a large decrease in near-term power prices that affects the market's view of long-term power prices, or a change in the credit rating or bankruptcy of a counterparty, could result in an impairment of one or more of the residual values, but not necessarily to all of the residual values. however, if, because of changes in assumptions, all the residual values related to the merchant energy plants were deemed to be zero, we would recognize an after-tax charge to income of approximately $177 million.
pse&g, power and services recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. these aros are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred and are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets. pse&g, as a rate-regulated entity, recognizes regulatory assets or liabilities as a result
table of contents of timing differences between the recording of costs and costs recovered through the rate-making process. we accrete the aro liability to reflect the passage of time.
assumptions and approach used: because quoted market prices are not available for aros, we estimate the initial fair value of an aro by calculating discounted cash flows that are dependent upon various assumptions, including:
•   estimation of dates for retirement, which can be dependent on environmental and other legislation,
•   amounts and timing of future cash expenditures associated with retirement, settlement or remediation activities,
•   market risk premium,
•   if applicable, past experience with government regulators regarding similar obligations.
we obtain updated cost studies triennially unless new information necessitates more frequent updates. the most recent cost study was done in 2015. when we revise any assumptions used to calculate fair values of existing aros, we adjust the aro balance and corresponding long-lived asset which impacts the amount of accretion and depreciation expense recognized in future periods.
nuclear decommissioning aros aros related to the future decommissioning of power's nuclear facilities comprised 94% of power's total aros as of december 31, 2015. power determines its aros for its nuclear units by assigning probability weighting to various discounted cash flow outcomes for each of its nuclear units that incorporate the assumptions above as well as:
•   safe storage for a period of time after retirement, and
•   recovery from the federal government of costs incurred for spent nuclear fuel.
effect if different assumptions used: changes in the assumptions could result in a material change in the aro balance sheet obligation and the period over which we accrete to the ultimate liability. for example, a decrease of 1% in the discount rate would result in a $37 million increase in the nuclear aro as of december 31, 2015. an increase of 1% in the inflation rate would result in a $191 million increase in the nuclear aro as of december 31, 2015. also, if we did not assume that we would recover from the federal government the costs incurred for spent nuclear fuel, the nuclear aro would increase by $267 million at december 31, 2015.
accounting for regulated businesses pse&g prepares its financial statements to comply with gaap for rate-regulated enterprises, which differs in some respects from accounting for non-regulated businesses. in general, accounting for rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. as a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (regulatory asset) or recognize obligations (regulatory liability) if the rates established are designed to recover the costs and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged or collected. this accounting results in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than that of enterprises that are not regulated.
assumptions and approach used: pse&g recognizes regulatory assets where it is probable that such costs will be recoverable in future rates from customers and regulatory liabilities where it is probable that refunds will be made to customers in future billings. the highest degree of probability is an order from the bpu either approving recovery of the deferred costs over a future period or requiring the refund of a liability over a future period.
virtually all of pse&g's regulatory assets and liabilities are supported by bpu orders. in the absence of an order, pse&g will consider the following when determining whether to record a regulatory asset or liability:
•   past experience regarding similar items with the bpu,
•   treatment of a similar item in an order by the bpu for another utility,
•   passage of new legislation, and
all deferred costs are subject to prudence reviews by the bpu. when the recovery of a regulatory asset or payment of a regulatory liability is no longer probable, pse&g charges or credits earnings, as appropriate.
effect if different assumptions used: a change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on our results of operations or our cash flows. see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 5. regulatory assets and liabilities for a description of the amounts and nature of regulatory balance sheet amounts.

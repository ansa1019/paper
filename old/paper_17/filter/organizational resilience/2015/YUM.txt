item 1a.   risk factors.
risks related to our business and industry you should carefully review the risks described below as they identify important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements and historical trends.
food safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.
food-borne illnesses, such as e. coli, hepatitis a, trichinosis and salmonella, occur or may occur within our system from time to time.  in addition, food safety issues such as food tampering, contamination and adulteration occur or may occur within our system from time to time. any report or publicity linking us or one of our concept restaurants, including restaurants operated by our concepts' franchisees, to instances of food-borne illness or food safety issues could adversely affect our concepts' brands and reputations as well as our revenues and profits, and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation and damages.  if a customer of our concepts becomes ill from food-borne illnesses or as a result of food safety issues, restaurants in our system may be temporarily closed, which would decrease our revenues.  in addition, instances or allegations of food-borne illness or food safety
issues, real or perceived, involving our restaurants, restaurants of competitors, or suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), or otherwise involving the types of food served at our restaurants, could result in negative publicity that could adversely affect our sales. the occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, which could result in disruptions in our supply chain and/or lower margins for us and our concepts' franchisees.
our significant china operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.
a significant and growing portion of our restaurants are located, and our revenues and profits originate, in china.  as a consequence, our overall financial results are heavily dependent on our results in china, and our business is significantly exposed to risks there. these risks include changes in economic conditions (including consumer spending, unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation), consumer preferences, taxation (including income and non-income based tax rates and laws) and the regulatory environment, as well as increased media scrutiny of our business and industry and increased competition.  in addition, our results of operations in china and the value of our chinese assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.  an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the chinese renminbi could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings. there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
in addition, any significant or prolonged deterioration in u.s.-china relations could adversely affect our china business.  certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government, and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within china.  there are also uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights in china.  if we were unable to enforce our intellectual property or contract rights in china, our business would be adversely impacted.
although we have announced our intention to separate our china business through a spin-off to existing shareholders, following the spin-off the new china entity will be our largest franchisee or licensee, and we will therefore continue to be exposed to many of the foregoing risks even after the completion of the proposed spin-off.
health concerns arising from outbreaks of viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business.
outbreaks of avian flu occur from time to time around the world, and these outbreaks could reach pandemic levels.  public concern over avian flu generally may cause fear about the consumption of chicken, eggs and other products derived from poultry, which could cause customers to consume less poultry and related products. this would likely result in lower revenues and profits. avian flu outbreaks could also adversely affect the price and availability of poultry, which could negatively impact our profit margins and revenues. widespread outbreaks could also affect our ability to attract and retain employees.
furthermore, other viruses such as h1n1 or "swine flu" may be transmitted through human contact, and the risk of contracting viruses could cause employees or guests to avoid gathering in public places, which could adversely affect restaurant guest traffic or the ability to adequately staff restaurants.  we could also be adversely affected if jurisdictions in which we have restaurants impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations of restaurants.  even if such measures are not implemented and a virus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or health risk may affect our business.
our international operations subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.
a significant portion of our concepts' restaurants are operated in countries and territories outside of the u.s., and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations.  as a result, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations.  these risks, which can vary substantially by country, include political instability, corruption, social and ethnic unrest, changes in economic conditions (including consumer spending, unemployment levels and wage and commodity inflation), the regulatory environment, income and non-income based tax rates and laws, foreign exchange control regimes and consumer preferences as well as changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where our restaurants are operated.
in addition, our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect reported earnings.  more specifically, an increase in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, such as the australian dollar, the british pound, the canadian dollar and the euro, as well as currencies in certain emerging markets, such as the russian ruble, could have an adverse effect on our reported earnings.  there can be no assurance as to the future effect of any such changes on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
failure to protect the integrity and security of personal information of our customers and employees could result in substantial costs, expose us to litigation and damage our reputation.
we receive and maintain certain personal financial and other information about our customers and employees. the use and handling of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations, as well as by certain third-party contracts. if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, cyber-attack or a network security incident or our employees, franchisees or vendors fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could result in liabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a loss of customer confidence, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. additionally, we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure.
shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues.
the products sold by our concepts and their franchisees are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. we are also dependent upon third parties to make frequent deliveries of food products and supplies that meet our specifications at competitive prices.  shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we use and the operations of our restaurants.  such shortages or disruptions could be caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes, increased demand, problems in production or distribution, restrictions on imports or exports, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit, political instability in the countries in which suppliers and distributors are located, the financial instability of suppliers and distributors, suppliers' or distributors' failure to meet our standards, product quality issues, inflation, other factors relating to the suppliers and distributors and the countries in which they are located, food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements or other conditions beyond our control.  a shortage or interruption in the availability of certain food products or supplies could increase costs and limit the availability of products critical to restaurant operations, which in turn could lead to restaurant closures and/or a decrease in sales.  in addition, failure by a principal distributor for our concepts and/or our concepts' franchisees to meet its service requirements could lead to a disruption of service or supply until a new distributor is engaged, and any disruption could have an adverse effect on our business.
we may not attain our target development goals, aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales and new restaurants may not be profitable.
our growth strategy depends in large part on our ability to increase our net restaurant count in markets outside the u.s., especially in china and other emerging markets.  the successful development of new units depends in large part on our ability and the ability of our concepts' franchisees to open new restaurants and to operate these restaurants profitably.  we cannot guarantee that we, or our concepts' franchisees, will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that new restaurants will be operated profitably.  further, there is no assurance that any new restaurant will produce operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants.  other risks which could impact our ability to increase our net restaurant count include prevailing economic conditions and our, or our concepts' franchisees', ability to obtain suitable restaurant locations, negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for the locations, obtain required permits and approvals in a timely manner, hire and train qualified personnel and meet construction schedules.
expansion into target markets could also be affected by our concepts' franchisees' ability to obtain financing to construct and open new restaurants.  if it becomes more difficult or more expensive for our concepts' franchisees to obtain financing to develop new restaurants, the expected growth of our system could slow and our future revenues and operating cash flows could be adversely impacted.
in addition, the new restaurants could impact the sales of our existing restaurants nearby.  there can be no assurance that sales cannibalization will not occur or become more significant in the future as we increase our presence in existing markets.
changes in commodity, labor and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.
an increase in certain commodity prices, such as food, supply and energy costs, could adversely affect our operating results.  our operating expenses also include employee wages and benefits and insurance costs (including workers' compensation, general liability, property and health) which may increase over time. such increases could result from government imposition of higher minimum wages or from general economic or competitive conditions, which could affect wage rates. in addition, significant increases in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors.  any increase in the prices of the commodities we use or operating expenses we incur could adversely affect our profit margins. because our concepts and their franchisees provide competitively priced food, our ability to pass along increased expenses to our customers is limited.
our operating results are closely tied to the success of our concepts' franchisees and licensees.
a significant portion of our restaurants are operated by franchisees and licensees from whom we derive a significant portion of our revenues in the form of royalty payments. as a result, the success of our business depends in part upon the operational and financial success of our concepts' franchisees and licensees.  we have limited control over how our concepts' franchisees' and licensees' businesses are run, and the inability of franchisees or licensees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments.
if franchisees or licensees incur too much debt, if their operating expenses or commodity prices increase or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to operate profitably or repay existing debt, it could result in financial distress, including insolvency or bankruptcy.  if a significant franchisee or licensee or a significant number of our concepts' franchisees or licensees become financially distressed, our operating results could be impacted through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable.
our success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brands.
our success depends in large part upon our ability and our franchisees' and licensees' ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands and our customers' connection to our brands.  brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us, our franchisees, licensees or suppliers, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation.  for example, our brands could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality of our suppliers, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true.  similarly, entities in our supply chain may engage in conduct, including alleged human rights abuses, that damages our or our brands' reputations. any such incident could cause a decline in consumer confidence in, or the perception of, our concepts and/or our products and decrease the value of our brands as well as consumer demand for our products, which would likely result in lower revenues and profits. additionally, our corporate reputation could suffer from a real or perceived failure of corporate governance or misconduct by a company officer or representative.
our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business.
there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including weblogs (blogs), social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests and/or may be inaccurate. the dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information's accuracy. the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.
other risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about our concepts, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud and disclosure of out-of-date information. the inappropriate use of social media by our customers or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our results.
we are regularly involved in legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort, intellectual property, breach of contract, securities, derivative and other litigation (see the discussion of legal proceedings in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10-k). plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated.  regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact reported earnings.  with respect to insured claims, a judgment for monetary damages in excess of any insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also adversely affect our reputation, which in turn could adversely affect our results.
in addition, the restaurant industry has been subject to claims that relate to the nutritional content of food products, as well as claims that the menus and practices of restaurant chains have led to customer health issues, including weight gain and other adverse
effects.  we may also be subject to these types of claims in the future and, even if we are not, publicity about these matters (particularly directed at the quick service and fast-casual segments of the retail food industry) may harm our reputation and adversely affect our results.
changes in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations may adversely affect our business operations, growth prospects or financial condition.
our concepts and their franchisees are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world. these laws change regularly and are increasingly complex. for example, we are subject to:
•   the americans with disabilities act in the u.s. and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas.
•   the u.s. fair labor standards act, which governs matters such as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, as well as family leave mandates and a variety of similar state laws that govern these and other employment law matters.
•   laws and regulations in government-mandated health care benefits such as the patient protection and affordable care act.
•   laws and regulations relating to health, sanitation, food, workplace safety, child labor, including laws prohibiting the use of certain "hazardous equipment" by employees younger than the age of 18 years of age, and fire safety and prevention.
•   laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, and consumer protection.
•   environmental regulations.
compliance with new or existing laws and regulations could impact our operations. the compliance costs associated with these laws and regulations could be substantial. any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation, international expansion efforts, growth prospects and financial condition or result in, among other things, litigation, revocation of required licenses, governmental investigations or proceedings, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. publicity relating to any such noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues.
a broader standard for determining joint employer status may adversely affect our business operations and increase our liabilities.
the national labor relations board has recently adopted a new and broader standard for determining when two or more otherwise unrelated employers may be found to be a joint employer of the same employees under the national labor relations act. if this joint employer liability standard is upheld or adopted by other government agencies, it could cause us or our concepts to be liable or held responsible for unfair labor practices and other violations, and required to conduct collective bargaining negotiations, regarding employees of totally separate, independent employers, most notably our franchisees. in such event, our operating expenses may increase as a result of required modifications to our business practices, increased litigation, governmental investigations or proceedings, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil liability.
failure to comply with anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws may adversely affect our business operations.
the foreign corrupt practices act, the uk bribery act and similar laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices are the subject of increasing scrutiny and enforcement around the world. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, particularly as we expand our operations in emerging markets. any such violations or suspected violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial fines and significant investigation costs, and could also materially damage our reputation, brands, international expansion efforts and prospects, business and operating results. publicity relating to any noncompliance or alleged noncompliance could also harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues.
tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
a significant percentage of our profit is earned outside the u.s. and taxed at lower rates than the u.s. statutory rates.  historically, the cash we generate outside the u.s. has principally been used to fund our international development. however, if the cash
generated by our u.s. business is not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the u.s., we may need to repatriate a greater portion of our international earnings to the u.s. in the future.  we are required to record u.s. income tax expense in our financial statements at the point in time when our management determines that we no longer have the ability and intent to indefinitely postpone tax consequences related to those international earnings. this could cause our worldwide effective tax rate to increase materially.
we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, withholding and franchise taxes in both the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions. we are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the internal revenue service ("irs") and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and non-income based taxes inside and outside of the u.s. these reviews could include challenges of our methodologies for transfer pricing. if the irs or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties.  payment of such additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
in addition, we are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide. changes in such legislation, regulation or interpretation could increase our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. this includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the base erosion profit shifting project initiated by the organization for economic co-operation and development.
failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.
we regard our yum®, kfc®, pizza hut® and taco bell® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. we have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the united states and foreign jurisdictions. however, from time to time we become aware of names and marks identical or confusingly similar to our service marks being used by other persons. although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. in addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our concepts have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.
our business may be adversely impacted by general economic conditions.
our results of operations are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers, which may be affected by general economic conditions globally or in one or more of the markets we serve.  some of the factors that impact discretionary consumer spending include unemployment, disposable income, the price of gasoline, stock market performance and consumer confidence.  these and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive.
the retail food industry in which we operate is highly competitive with respect to price and quality of food products, new product development, advertising levels and promotional initiatives, customer service, reputation, restaurant location, and attractiveness and maintenance of properties.  if consumer or dietary preferences change, or our restaurants are unable to compete successfully with other retail food outlets in new and existing markets, our business could be adversely affected.  we also face growing competition as a result of convergence in grocery, convenience, deli and restaurant services, including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals, including pizzas and entrees with side dishes.  competition from delivery aggregators and other food delivery services has also increased in recent years, particularly in urbanized areas. increased competition could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. in addition, in the retail food industry, labor is a primary operating cost component.  competition for qualified employees could also require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees, which could adversely impact our profit margins.
we intend to substantially increase our level of debt which would make us more sensitive to the effects of economic downturns and could adversely affect our business.
in late 2015, we announced that we intend to return approximately $6.2 billion of capital to shareholders prior to the separation of our china business through share repurchases and/or a special dividend. to finance that return of capital we expect to incur
significant additional indebtedness, some of which may be secured debt. this would have the effect of substantially increasing our total leverage.
•   increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to plan for and respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions and changes in our business and the competitive environment;
•   requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases or other corporate purposes;
•   increasing our vulnerability to a downgrade of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets;
•   restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;
•   increasing our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates insofar as current and future borrowings are subject to variable rates of interest;
•   making it more difficult for us to repay, refinance or satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;
•   limiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future and increasing the cost of any such borrowing;
•   imposing restrictive covenants on our operations, which, if not complied with, could result in an event of default, which in turn, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the applicable debt, and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies; and
•   increasing our exposure to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and our debt is or is expected to be denominated in u.s. dollars.
there is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. as a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
risks related to the planned spin-off the proposed spin-off of our china business is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and will involve significant time and attention, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.
we have announced our intention to separate yum's china business from yum into an independent, publicly-traded company by the end of 2016. this transaction, which is expected to be a u.s. tax-free spin-off of our china business, is complex in nature, subject to various conditions, and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market, regulatory and certain other conditions. we expect to file a registration statement on form 10 with the securities and exchange commission ("sec") that will contain detailed information regarding the business proposed to be spun-off. completion of the spin-off will be contingent upon a number of factors, including the effectiveness of the registration statement, final approval by our board of directors, receipt of a tax opinion and other conditions. for these and other reasons, the spin-off may not be completed as expected by the end of 2016, if at all.
additionally, execution of the proposed spin-off will require significant time and attention from management, which may distract management from the operation of our business and the execution of our other initiatives. our employees may also be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the spin-off. we may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating key employees during the pendency of the spin-off and following its completion. any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
the proposed spin-off may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits and may adversely affect our business.
even if the proposed spin-off is completed, we may not achieve, or may not achieve in a timely fashion, some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off and the spin-off may in fact adversely affect our business. for example, once the china business becomes independent, it may choose to pursue growth opportunities with brands or businesses unrelated to our concepts, which could divert attention and resources away from the growth of our concepts in china.
in addition, if the spin-off is completed, the company's operational and financial profile and the composition of the company's revenue will change materially. there can be no assurance that these changes will yield the benefits currently expected or intended
or that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies following the completion of the proposed spin-off will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed spin-off not occurred.
the spin-off transactions could result in substantial u.s. tax liability.
the spin-off will be conditioned on our receipt of an opinion of outside counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to us, substantially to the effect that, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off and certain related transactions will qualify under sections 355 and/or 368 of the u.s. internal revenue code. the opinion will rely on various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by the new china entity and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion. the opinion will not be binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail.
if, notwithstanding receipt of the opinion, the spin-off transaction were determined to be a taxable transaction, we would be treated as having sold shares of the new china entity in a taxable transaction, likely resulting in a significant taxable gain. in addition, each u.s. holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new china entity in the spin-off transaction would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of the new china entity received. that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. for each such stockholder, any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder's tax basis in our shares of common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain.
at the time of the spin-off, we will enter into a tax matters agreement with the new china entity. the tax matters agreement will address which company, yum or the new china entity, will be responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of the spin-off transaction.
the spin-off may be subject to china indirect transfer tax.
the china state administration of taxation recently issued bulletin 7 on income arising from indirect transfers of assets by non-resident enterprises. pursuant to bulletin 7, an "indirect transfer" of people's republic of china (prc) taxable assets, including equity interests in a prc resident enterprise, by a non-resident enterprise, may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of prc taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor has avoided payment of prc enterprise income tax. as a result, gains derived from such an indirect transfer may be subject to prc enterprise income tax of 10%.
we have evaluated the potential applicability of bulletin 7 to our plan to separate our china business in a tax free restructuring and believe it is more likely than not that bulletin 7 does not apply. we believe that the restructuring has reasonable commercial purpose.
however, given how recently bulletin 7 was promulgated there are significant uncertainties regarding what constitutes a reasonable commercial purpose, how the safe harbor provisions for group restructurings are to be interpreted and how the taxing authorities will ultimately view our planned spin-off. as a result, our position could be challenged by the tax authorities resulting in a 10% tax assessed on the difference between the fair market value and the tax basis of the separated china business. as our tax basis in the china business is minimal, the amount of such a tax could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.
if the proposed spin-off is consummated, there may be substantial changes in our stockholder base, which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate following the proposed spin-off.
investors holding yum's common stock today may hold yum common stock because of a decision to invest in a company with significant china or emerging markets exposure. if the proposed spin-off is completed, shares of yum common stock will represent an investment in a company with less exposure to china, a key emerging market. this change may not match some holders' investment strategies, which could cause investors to sell their shares of yum common stock. excessive selling pressure could cause the market price of yum common stock to decrease following the completion of the proposed spin-off.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
introduction and overview the following management's discussion and analysis ("md&a"), should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements ("financial statements") in item 8 and the forward-looking statements and the risk factors set forth in item 1a.
yum! brands, inc. ("yum" or the "company") operates, franchises or licenses a worldwide system of over 42,000 restaurants in more than 130 countries and territories operating primarily under the kfc, pizza hut or taco bell (collectively the "concepts") brands. these three concepts are the global leaders in the chicken, pizza and mexican-style food categories, respectively.  of the over 42,000 restaurants, 21% are operated by the company and its subsidiaries and 79% are operated by franchisees, licensees or unconsolidated affiliates.
as of december 26, 2015, yum consists of five operating segments:
•   the kfc division which includes all operations of the kfc concept outside of china division and india division
•   the pizza hut division which includes all operations of the pizza hut concept outside of china division and india division
•   the taco bell division which includes all operations of the taco bell concept outside of india division effective january, 2016 the india division was segmented by brand, integrated into the global kfc, pizza hut and taco bell divisions, and is no longer a separate operating segment. while our consolidated results will not be impacted, we will restate our historical segment information during 2016 for consistent presentation.
in october, 2015 we announced our intent to separate yum's china business from yum into an independent, publicly-traded company by the end of 2016. this transaction, which is expected to be a tax-free spin-off of our china business, will create two powerful, independent, focused growth companies with distinct strategies, financial profiles and investment characteristics. the new china entity will become a licensee of yum in mainland china, with exclusive rights to the kfc, pizza hut and taco bell concepts. upon completion of the planned spin-off, yum will become more of a "pure play" franchisor with more stable earnings, higher profit margins, lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion. consistent with this strategy yum is targeting 96% franchisee ownership of its restaurants by the end of 2017.
yum has announced its intention to return substantial capital to shareholders prior to this planned spin-off, the majority of which will be funded by incremental borrowings. with this recapitalization, the company is transitioning to a non-investment grade credit rating with a balance sheet more consistent with highly-levered peer restaurant franchise companies. moreover, this will allow for an ongoing return-of-capital framework that will seek to optimize the company's long-term growth rate on a per-share basis.
completion of the spin-off will be subject to certain conditions, including receiving final approval from the yum board of directors, receipt of various regulatory approvals, receipt of an opinion of counsel with respect to certain tax matters, the effectiveness of filings related to public listing and applicable securities laws, and other terms and conditions as may be determined by the board of directors. there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed transaction or that the transaction will be completed.
our historical ongoing earnings growth model has targeted a 10% earnings per share ("eps") growth rate, which was based on operating profit growth targets of 15% in china, 10% for our kfc division, 8% for our pizza hut division, and 6% for our taco bell division. see the division discussions within the results of operations section of this md&a for further details on our divisions' 2015 targets.
yum's 2016 operating profit is expected to grow 10% in constant currency, including the impact of 2016 having a 53rd week. while we expect to spin off our china business prior to the end of 2016, this target assumes our china business will remain part of yum through the end of 2016. yum's 2016 target is based on operating profit growth instead of eps growth given the uncertainties surrounding the specific timing and pricing of our 2016 shareholder capital returns.
subsequent to the spin-off of our china business, we are targeting about 15% ongoing eps growth for the new china entity and about 15% ongoing total shareholder return for the remaining ongoing yum business. the new china entity's 15% eps growth includes contributions from both operating profit and financial strategies such as share repurchases. yum's 15% total shareholder return includes ongoing operating profit growth targets of 10% for our kfc division, 8% for our pizza hut division and 6% for
our taco bell division, which are consistent with our historical ongoing earnings growth model. the 15% total shareholder return also includes 1% to 2% growth from the china license fee, 3% to 5% growth from financial strategies and approximately 2% yield from dividends.
we intend for this md&a to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our results of operations, including performance metrics that management uses to assess the company's performance. throughout this md&a, we commonly discuss the following performance metrics:
•   the company provides certain percentage changes excluding the impact of foreign currency translation ("fx" or "forex"). these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. we believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.
•   system sales growth includes the results of all restaurants regardless of ownership, including company-owned, franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants that operate our concepts, except for non-company-owned restaurants for which we do not receive a sales-based royalty. sales of franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurants typically generate ongoing franchise and license fees for the company at a rate of 4% to 6% of sales. franchise, unconsolidated affiliate and license restaurant sales are not included in company sales on the consolidated statements of income; however, the franchise and license fees are included in the company's revenues. we believe system sales growth is useful to investors as a significant indicator of the overall strength of our business as it incorporates all of our revenue drivers, company and franchise same-store sales as well as net unit growth.
•   same-store sales growth is the estimated percentage change in sales of all restaurants that have been open and in the yum system one year or more.
•   company restaurant profit ("restaurant profit") is defined as company sales less expenses incurred directly by our company-owned restaurants in generating company sales. company restaurant margin as a percentage of sales is defined as restaurant profit divided by company sales. within the company sales and restaurant profit analysis, store portfolio actions represent the net impact of new unit openings, acquisitions, refranchising and store closures, and other primarily represents the impact of same-store sales as well as the impact of changes in costs such as inflation/deflation.
•   in addition to the results provided in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") throughout this md&amp;a, the company provides non-gaap measurements which present operating results on a basis before special items. the company uses earnings before special items as a key performance measure of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and special items are not included in any of our segment results. this non-gaap measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap. rather, the company believes that the presentation of earnings before special items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present results, excluding those items that the company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.
all note references herein refer to the notes to the financial statements.  tabular amounts are displayed in millions of u.s. dollars except per share and unit count amounts, or as otherwise specifically identified. percentages may not recompute due to rounding.
results of operations summary all comparisons within this summary are versus the same period a year ago and exclude the impact of special items.  all system sales growth and operating profit comparisons exclude the impact of foreign currency.
2015 diluted eps increased 3% to $3.18 per share versus our target of 10% growth, as sales and profits at our china division did not recover as strongly as expected and adverse foreign currency translation significantly impacted reported earnings.
we expected china division sales and profits to grow significantly in the second half of 2015 as we recovered from the adverse publicity in july 2014 surrounding improper food handling practices of a former supplier. china division sales initially turned significantly positive as we lapped the july 2014 supplier incident, but overall sales in the second half of 2015 trailed our expectations, particularly at pizza hut casual dining. kfc china grew same stores sales 3% in q3 and 6% in q4, while pizza hut casual dining same-store sales declined 1% in q3 and 8% in q4. for the year china division same-store sales declined 4%.
foreign currency translation from our international operations negatively impacted eps growth by 6 percentage points.

corporate g&a expenses in 2015, the increase in corporate g&a expenses was driven by higher professional fees and higher pension costs.
in 2014, the decrease in corporate g&a expenses was driven by lower pension costs, including lapping higher pension settlement charges, partially offset by higher professional fees.
unallocated closures and impairments in 2014 and 2013, unallocated closures and impairments represent little sheep impairment charges. see note 4.
other unallocated in 2015, other unallocated primarily includes foreign exchange losses and a write-down related to our decision to dispose of a corporate aircraft in china.
in 2014 and 2013, other unallocated primarily includes foreign exchange losses.
the decrease in interest expense, net for 2014 was driven by lapping $118 million of premiums paid and other costs related to the extinguishment of debt in 2013. see note 4.
consolidated cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was $2,139 million in 2015 versus $2,049 million in 2014. the increase was primarily driven by lapping higher income tax payments in the prior year, partially offset by higher pension contributions.
in 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $2,049 million compared to $2,139 million in 2013. the decrease was primarily driven by higher income taxes paid.
net cash used in investing activities was $682 million in 2015 compared to $936 million in 2014. the decrease was primarily driven by higher refranchising proceeds and lower capital spending.
in 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $936 million compared to $886 million in 2013. the increase was primarily driven by lower refranchising proceeds, partially offset by lapping the acquisition of restaurants in turkey from an existing franchisee in april 2013.
net cash used in financing activities was $1,292 million in 2015 compared to $1,114 million in 2014. the increase was primarily driven by higher share repurchases and dividends, partially offset by higher net borrowings.
consolidated financial condition the increase in our short-term borrowings is primarily due to the outstanding balance of $600 million on a new term loan facility and the reclassification of $300 million senior unsecured notes as short-term due to their april 2016 maturity date, partially offset by the maturity of $250 million senior unsecured notes in september 2015.
long-term debt is also impacted by outstanding borrowings of $701 million under our revolving credit facility as of december 26, 2015. see note 10.
liquidity and capital resources operating in the retail food industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company-owned stores and from our extensive franchise operations which require a limited yum investment. net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded $2 billion each of the last five fiscal years. these operating cash flows have largely funded our historical capital spending and returns to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases.
to the extent operating cash flows plus other sources of cash such as refranchising proceeds have not covered our desired levels of capital spending and returns to shareholders, we have had borrowing capacity to fund shortfalls. net cash provided by operating activities, refranchising proceeds, capital spending, repurchases of shares of common stock and dividends paid on common stock each of the last three years are as follows:
net cash provided by operating activities          $2,139              $2,049              $2,139
capital spending                                     (973   )          (1,033   )          (1,049   )
repurchase shares of common stock                  (1,200   )            (820   )            (770   )
we generate a significant amount of cash from operating activities outside the u.s. that we have used historically to fund our international development. to the extent we have needed to repatriate international cash to fund our u.s. discretionary cash spending, including returns to shareholders and debt repayments, we have historically been able to do so in a tax-efficient manner.
if we experience an unforeseen decrease in our cash flows from our u.s. businesses or are unable to refinance future u.s. debt maturities we may be required to repatriate future international earnings at tax rates higher than we have historically experienced.
as previously noted we intend to spin-off our china business from yum into an independent, publicly-traded company prior to the end of 2016. upon completion of the planned spin-off, yum will become more of a "pure play" franchisor with more stable earnings, higher profit margins, lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion.
yum has announced its intention to return approximately $6.2 billion of capital to shareholders prior to this planned spin-off, the majority of which would be funded by incremental borrowings. we expect these incremental borrowings to occur as the company transitions to a non-investment grade credit rating with a balance sheet more consistent with highly-levered peer restaurant franchise companies.
as part of our intention to return up to $6.2 billion to shareholders, we began increasing our rate of share repurchases in october, 2015. in december, 2015 we entered into a $1.5 billion short-term credit facility to help fund these share repurchases, and there were $600 million of outstanding borrowings related to this facility as of december 26, 2015. we expect to borrow an additional $5.2 billion in 2016.
when we announced our recapitalization plan, our credit ratings were lowered to non-investment grade by both standard & poor's (bb) and moody's investor services (ba3). this downgrade did not significantly impact our 2015 borrowing costs and we do not expect it to impact our ability to execute our recapitalization plan or the balance of our planned shareholder returns. while we do not anticipate any further downgrade to our credit rating, such a downgrade would increase the company's current borrowing costs and could impact the company's ability to access the credit markets cost effectively if necessary. based on the amount and composition of our debt at december 26, 2015, our interest expense would not materially increase on a full-year basis should we receive a further one-level downgrade in our ratings.
borrowing capacity our primary bank credit agreement comprises a $1.3 billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") which matures in march 2017 and includes 24 participating banks with commitments ranging from $23 million to $115 million. we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank.
under the terms of the credit facility, we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit, less outstanding letters of credit or banker's acceptances, where applicable. at december 26, 2015, our unused credit facility totaled $594 million net of outstanding letters of credit of $5 million and outstanding borrowings of $701 million. the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% over the "london interbank offered rate" ("libor"). the exact spread over libor under the credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria. interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly.
on december 8, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement providing for an unsecured term loan facility (the "short-term loan credit facility") in an amount up to $1.5 billion which matures in june 2016 with an option for yum to extend maturity for an additional three months and includes three participating banks. this credit agreement is being used to fund a portion of our planned capital returns to shareholders.
under the terms of the short-term loan credit facility, we may borrow up to the full amount of the facility in up to three draws. at december 26, 2015, our unused short-term loan credit facility totaled $900 million net of outstanding borrowings of $600 million. the interest rate for most borrowings under the short-term loan credit facility ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% over libor. the exact spread over libor under the short-term loan credit facility depends upon our performance against specified financial criteria. interest on any outstanding borrowings under the short-term loan credit facility is payable at least quarterly.
both the credit facility and the short-term loan credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contain financial covenants relating to the maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. the agreements for both credit facilities also contain affirmative and negative covenants including, among other things, limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens, and certain other transactions specified in the agreement. given the company's strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december 26, 2015 with a considerable amount of cushion. additionally, both facilities contain cross-default provisions whereby our failure to make any payment on our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $125 million, or the acceleration of the maturity of any such indebtedness, will constitute a default under such agreement.
the majority of our remaining long-term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from 2016 through 2043 and stated interest rates ranging from 3.75% to 6.88%. the notes represent senior, unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness. amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were $2.5 billion at december 26, 2015. our senior unsecured notes contain cross-default provisions whereby the acceleration of the maturity of any of our indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $50 million will constitute a default under the senior unsecured notes unless such indebtedness is discharged, or the acceleration of the maturity of that indebtedness is annulled, within 30 days after notice.
contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december 26, 2015 included:
capital leases(b)                         287                      20                      40                    39                       188

(a)   amounts include maturities of debt outstanding as of december 26, 2015 and expected interest payments on those outstanding amounts on a nominal basis. see note 10.
(b)   these obligations, which are shown on a nominal basis, relate primarily to approximately 8,000 company-owned restaurants. see note 11.
(c)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty. purchase obligations relate primarily to supply agreements, marketing, information technology, purchases of property, plant and equipment ("pp&amp;e") as well as consulting, maintenance and other agreements.
(d)   includes actuarially-determined timing of payments from our most significant unfunded pension plan as well as scheduled payments from our deferred compensation plan and other unfunded benefit plans where payment dates are determinable. this table excludes $34 million of future benefit payments for deferred compensation and other unfunded benefit plans to be paid upon separation of employee's service or retirement from the company, as we cannot reasonably estimate the dates of these future cash payments.
we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees, the most significant of which are in the u.s. and uk.  the most significant of the u.s. plans, the yum retirement plan (the "plan"), is funded while benefits from our other significant u.s. plan are paid by the company as incurred (see footnote (d) above).  our funding policy for the plan is to contribute annually amounts that will at least equal the minimum amounts required to comply with the pension protection act of 2006.  however, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time to improve the plan's funded status.  at december 26, 2015 the plan was in a net underfunded position of $29 million.  the uk pension plans were in a net overfunded position of $58 million at our 2015 measurement date.
we do not anticipate making any significant contributions to the plan in 2016. investment performance and corporate bond rates have a significant effect on our net funding position as they drive our asset balances and discount rate assumptions.  future changes in investment performance and corporate bond rates could impact our funded status and the timing and amounts of required contributions in 2016 and beyond.
our post-retirement health care plan in the u.s. is not required to be funded in advance, but is pay as you go.  we made post-retirement benefit payments of $6 million in 2015 and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table.  see note 13.
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self-insured, including workers' compensation, employment practices liability, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and property losses (collectively "property and casualty losses") and employee healthcare and long-term disability claims.  the majority of our recorded liability for self-insured property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and long-term disability claims represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled.
we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately $28 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relating to various tax positions we have taken.  these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations, and given the status of the examinations, we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.  these liabilities exclude amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow.
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table certain commitments associated with the kfc u.s. acceleration agreement (see note 4) as we cannot reliably estimate the specific timing of the remaining investments to be made in each of the next two years. in connection with this agreement we anticipate investing a total of approximately $125 million through 2017 primarily to fund new back-of-house equipment for franchisees and to provide incentives to accelerate franchisee store remodels, of which $72 million was invested in 2015.
off-balance sheet arrangements see the lease guarantees, franchise loan pool and equipment guarantees, and unconsolidated affiliates guarantees sections of note 18 for discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements.
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in may, 2014 the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), to provide principles within a single framework for revenue recognition of transactions involving contracts with customers across all industries. in july, 2015 the fasb approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new standard. asu 2014-09 is now effective for the company in our first quarter of fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. the standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. the standard will not impact our recognition of revenue from company-owned restaurants or our recognition of continuing fees from franchisees or licensees, which are based on a percentage of franchise and license sales. we are continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions such as initial fees from franchisees and refranchising of company-owned restaurants.
critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments.  these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition.  changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future years.  a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows.
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets we review long-lived assets of restaurants (primarily pp&e and allocated intangible assets subject to amortization) semi-annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable.  we evaluate recoverability based on the restaurant's forecasted undiscounted cash flows, which incorporate our best estimate of sales growth and margin improvement based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants.  for restaurant assets that are deemed to not be recoverable, we write down the impaired restaurant to its estimated fair value.  key assumptions in the determination of fair value are the future after-tax cash flows of the restaurant, which are reduced by future royalties a franchisee would pay, and a discount rate.  the after-tax cash flows incorporate reasonable sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that would be used by a franchisee in the determination of a purchase price for the restaurant.  estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions.
we perform an impairment evaluation at a restaurant group level if it is more likely than not that we will refranchise restaurants as a group.  expected net sales proceeds are generally based on actual bids from the buyer, if available, or anticipated bids given
the discounted projected after-tax cash flows for the group of restaurants.  historically, these anticipated bids have been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received. the after-tax cash flows used in determining the anticipated bids incorporate reasonable assumptions we believe a franchisee would make such as sales growth and margin improvement as well as expectations as to the useful lives of the restaurant assets. these after-tax cash flows also include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties we would receive under a franchise agreement with terms substantially at market entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction.
the discount rate used in the fair value calculations is our estimate of the required rate of return that a franchisee would expect to receive when purchasing a similar restaurant or groups of restaurants and the related long-lived assets.  the discount rate incorporates rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows.
we evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist. we perform our annual test for impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets at the beginning of our fourth quarter. fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is generally estimated by discounting the expected future after-tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset.  our most significant indefinite-lived intangible asset is our little sheep trademark with a book value of $56 million at december 26, 2015. the fair value estimate of the little sheep trademark in our fourth quarter impairment testing exceeded its carrying value. fair value was determined using a relief-from-royalty valuation approach that included estimated future revenues as a significant input, and a discount rate of 13% as our estimate of the required rate-of-return that a third-party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing the little sheep trademark. the primary drivers of fair value include franchise revenue growth and revenues from a wholly-owned business that sells seasoning to retail customers. franchise revenue growth reflects annual same-store sales growth of 4% and approximately 35 new franchise units per year, partially offset by the impact of approximately 25 franchise closures per year. the seasoning business is forecasted to generate sales growth rates consistent with historical results.
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of our fourth quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist.  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying values. our reporting units are our business units (which are aligned based on geography) in our kfc, pizza hut and taco bell divisions and individual brands in our china and india divisions.  fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit, and is generally estimated using discounted expected future after-tax cash flows from company-owned restaurant operations and franchise royalties.
future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit.  future cash flows are based on growth expectations relative to recent historical performance and incorporate sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that we believe a third-party buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit.  the sales growth and margin improvement assumptions that factor into the discounted cash flows are highly correlated as cash flow growth can be achieved through various interrelated strategies such as product pricing and restaurant productivity initiatives. the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third-party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit. we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows.
the fair values of all our reporting units with goodwill balances were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the 2015 goodwill testing date.
when we refranchise restaurants, we include goodwill in the carrying amount of the restaurants disposed of based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in the refranchising versus the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.  the fair value of the portion of the reporting unit disposed of in a refranchising is determined by reference to the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee, which include a deduction for the anticipated, future royalties the franchisee will pay us associated with the franchise agreement entered into simultaneously with the refranchising transaction. appropriate adjustments are made to the fair value determinations if such franchise agreement is determined to not be at prevailing market rates.  when determining whether such franchise agreement is at prevailing market rates our primary consideration is consistency with the terms of our current franchise agreements both within the country that the restaurants are being refranchised in and around the world.  the company believes consistency in royalty rates as a percentage of sales is appropriate as the company and franchisee share in the impact of near-term fluctuations in sales results with the acknowledgment that over the long-term the royalty rate represents an appropriate rate for both parties.
the discounted value of the future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant and retained by the franchisee is reduced by future royalties the franchisee will pay the company.  the company thus considers the fair value of future royalties to be received under the franchise agreement as fair value retained in its determination of the goodwill to be written off when refranchising.  others may consider the fair value of these future royalties as fair value disposed of and thus would conclude that a larger percentage of a reporting unit's fair value is disposed of in a refranchising transaction.
during 2015, the company's reporting units with the most significant refranchising activity and recorded goodwill were kfc india, taco bell u.s. and kfc china.  within kfc india, 86 restaurants were refranchised (representing 42% of beginning-of-year company units) and less than $1 million in goodwill was written off (representing 25% of beginning-of-year goodwill). within taco bell u.s., 65 restaurants were refranchised (representing 7% of beginning-of-year company units) and $2 million in goodwill was written off (representing 2% of beginning-of-year goodwill). within kfc china, 52 restaurants were refranchised (representing 1% of beginning-of-year company units) and less than $1 million in goodwill was written off (representing less than 1% of beginning-of-year goodwill).

self-insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self-insured property and casualty losses.  the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment, benefit levels, medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self-insurance costs.  additionally, our reserve includes a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years required to settle claims, increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate.
see note 18 for a further discussion of our insurance programs.
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans. our two most significant plans are in the u.s. and combined had a projected benefit obligation ("pbo") of $1,134 million and a fair value of plan assets of $1,004 million at december 26, 2015.
the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels.  due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid, our pbos are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates.  for our u.s. plans, we measured our pbos using a discount rate of 4.90% at december 26, 2015.  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary.  the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody's or s&p with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans.  we exclude from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody's or s&p for a potential downgrade (if the potential downgrade would result in a rating below aa by both moody's and s&p) and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean.  in considering possible bond portfolios, the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit payment cash flows for that year.  such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one-year forward rates and used to meet the benefit payment cash flows in a future year.  the weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate.  we also ensure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary. a 50 basis-point increase in this discount rate would have decreased these u.s. plans' pbos by approximately $70 million at our measurement date.  conversely, a 50 basis-point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our u.s. plans' pbos by approximately $80 million at our measurement date.
the pension expense we will record in 2016 is also impacted by the discount rate, as well as the long-term rates of return on plan assets and mortality assumptions we selected at our measurement date.  we expect pension expense for our u.s. plans to decrease approximately $35 million in 2016.  the decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in amortization of net loss due to lower net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income.  lower net unrecognized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are primarily a result of a higher discount rate at our 2015 measurement date. a 50 basis-point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our 2016 u.s. pension expense by approximately $6 million.
our estimated long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets is based upon the weighted-average of historical returns for each asset category.  our expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets, for purposes of determining 2016 pension expense, at december 26, 2015 was 6.75%.  we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market
returns thereon.  a 100 basis point change in our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption would impact our 2016 u.s. pension expense by approximately $10 million. additionally, every 100 basis point variation in actual return on plan assets versus our expected return of 6.75% will impact our unrecognized pre-tax actuarial net loss by approximately $10 million.
a decrease in discount rates over time has largely contributed to an unrecognized pre-tax actuarial net loss of $138 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for these u.s. plans at december 26, 2015.  we will recognize approximately $6 million of such loss in net periodic benefit cost in 2016 versus $45 million recognized in 2015. see note 13.
income taxes at december 26, 2015, we had valuation allowances of approximately $250 million to reduce our $1.2 billion of deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.  the net deferred tax assets primarily relate to temporary differences in profitable u.s. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions, the majority of which do not expire, and u.s. foreign tax credit carryovers that expire 10 years from inception and for which we anticipate having foreign earnings to utilize. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider future taxable income in the various jurisdictions as well as carryforward periods and restrictions on usage. the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize deferred tax assets can significantly change based on future events, including our determinations as to feasibility of certain tax planning strategies. thus, recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes.
as a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.  we recognize the benefit of positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns in our income tax provision when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by these tax authorities.  a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement.  at december 26, 2015 we had $98 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $89 million of which are temporary in nature and, if recognized, would not impact the effective tax rate.  we evaluate unrecognized tax benefits, including interest thereon, on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events, including audit settlements, which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures.
we have investments in foreign subsidiaries where the carrying values for financial reporting exceed the tax basis.  we have not provided deferred tax on the portion of the excess that we believe is indefinitely reinvested, as we have the ability and intent to indefinitely postpone these basis differences from reversing with a tax consequence.   we estimate that our total temporary difference upon which we have not provided deferred tax is approximately $2.3 billion at december 26, 2015.  a determination of the deferred tax liability on this amount is not practicable.
if our intentions regarding our ability and intent to postpone these basis differences from reversing with a tax consequence change, deferred tax may need to be provided that could materially impact the provision for income taxes.

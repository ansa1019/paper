item 1a "risk factors" of part i of this filing contains a further discussion of these and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations. we disclaim any current intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. due to these important factors and risks, we cannot give assurances with respect to our future premium levels or our ability to control our future medical costs.
non-gaap financial presentation the company is providing certain non-gaap financial measures in this report as the company believes that these figures are helpful in allowing individuals to more accurately assess the ongoing nature of the company's operations and measure the company's performance more consistently. the company uses the presented non-gaap financial measures internally to allow management to focus on period-to-period changes in the company's core business operations. therefore, the company believes that this information is meaningful in addition to the information contained in the gaap presentation of financial information. the presentation of this additional non-gaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap.
part i item 1a. risk factors factors that may affect future results and the trading price of our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision.  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, in which case you could lose all or part of your investment.  you should also refer to the other information in this filing, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.  the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company.  additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company.
reductions in funding or changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate could substantially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
the majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including medicaid, medicare, chip, ltc, abd, foster care and health insurance marketplace premiums. the base premium rate paid for each program differs, depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits, a member's health status, age, gender, county or region and benefit mix. since medicaid was created in 1965, the federal government and the states have shared the costs, with the federal share currently averaging around 57%.
future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints. governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid, medicare, chip, ltc, abd and foster care. adverse economic conditions may continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs increases, creating more need for funding. we anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives, which may result in reductions in funding for programs, contraction of covered benefits, and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases. a reduction (or less than expected increase), a protracted delay, or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs, as well as termination of the contract for the convenience of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
additionally, changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs. recent legislation generally requires that eligibility levels be maintained, but this could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels. if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
lastly, if a federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time, federal government payment obligations, including its obligations under medicaid, medicare, chip, ltc, abd, foster care and the new health insurance marketplaces, may be delayed. similarly, if state government shutdowns were to occur, state payment obligations may be delayed. if the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis, our business could suffer, and our financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected.
failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
our profitability, to a significant degree, depends on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through our ability to contract favorably with hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers. for example, our medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year. if our actual medical expense exceeds our estimates, our health benefits ratio, or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue, would increase and our profits would decline. because of the narrow margins of our health plan business, relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results. changes in healthcare regulations and practices, the level of utilization of healthcare services, hospital and pharmaceutical costs, major epidemics or pandemics, new medical technologies, pharmaceutical compounds and other external factors, including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels, are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits.
our medical expense includes claims reported but not paid, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period. our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available. as more complete information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimate, and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified. however, we still cannot be sure that our medical claims liability estimate is adequate or that adjustments to the estimate will not unfavorably impact our results of operations.
additionally, when we commence operations in a new state, region or product, we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability. for a period of time after the inception of the new business, we base our estimates on state-provided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information. the addition of new categories of individuals who are eligible under new legislation may pose the same difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability. similarly, we may face difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability in 2016 for the relatively new and evolving health insurance marketplaces.
from time to time in the past, our actual results have varied from our estimates, particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members. if it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. in addition, if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums, our business operations, cash flows, or earnings could be negatively impacted.
the implementation of the health reform legislation and other reforms could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
in march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act, collectively referred to as the affordable care act (aca), were enacted. while the constitutionality of the aca was generally upheld by the supreme court in 2012, the court determined that states could not be required to expand medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing medicaid programs.
under the aca, medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level beginning january 1, 2014, subject to each states' election. the federal government will pay the entire costs for medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for three years (2014 through 2016). beginning in 2017, the federal share begins to decline, ending at 90% for 2020 and subsequent years. as of december 31, 2015, 31 states and the district of columbia have expanded medicaid eligibility, and additional states continue to discuss expansion. the aca also maintained chip eligibility standards through september 2019.
the aca required the establishment of health insurance marketplaces for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage commencing in january 2014. the aca required insurers participating on the health insurance marketplaces to offer a minimum level of benefits and included guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations.
our ability to adequately price products offered in the health insurance marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. we may be adversely selected by individuals who will have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants. in addition, the risk corridor, reinsurance and risk adjustment ("three rs") provisions of the aca established to reduce risk for insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the marketplace product. further, the reinsurance and risk corridor components may not be adequately funded. any variation from our expectations regarding acuity, enrollment levels, adverse selection, the three rs, or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) has stated that it will consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize medicaid expansion. states must provide a choice between at least two qualified health plans and offer very similar benefits as those available in the newly created health insurance marketplaces. arkansas became the first state to obtain federal approval to use medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for low-income residents and we began operations under the program beginning january 1, 2014.
the aca imposes an annual insurance industry assessment of $8.0 billion starting in 2014, and $11.3 billion in each of 2015 and 2016, with increasing annual amounts thereafter. such assessments are not deductible for federal and most state income tax purposes. the fee will be allocated based on health insurers' premium revenues in the previous year. each health insurer's fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee. market share is based on commercial, medicare, and medicaid premium revenue. not-for-profit insurers may have a competitive advantage since they are exempt from paying the fee if they receive at least 80% of their premium revenue from medicare, medicaid, and chip, and other not-for-profit insurers are allowed to exclude 50% of their premium revenue from the fee calculation. if we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the federal premium assessment (including the associated tax impact), or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new assessment, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.
there are numerous steps required to implement the legislation, including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations. further, various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level. because of the unsettled nature of these reforms and numerous steps required to implement them, we cannot predict what additional health insurance requirements will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business or our growth opportunities. although we believe the legislation may provide us with significant opportunities to grow our business, the enacted reforms, as well as future regulations and legislative changes, may in fact have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform, or do not do so as effectively as our competitors, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business.
our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government. in addition, the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation, regulation, review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector. in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are regulated by the relevant insurance, health and/or human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid, medicare and health insurance marketplace enrollees. for example, our health plan subsidiaries, as well as our applicable specialty companies, must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements, such as deposit and surplus requirements.
the frequent enactment of, changes to, or interpretations of laws and regulations could, among other things: force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network; require us to implement additional or different programs and systems; restrict revenue and enrollment growth; increase our healthcare and administrative costs; impose additional capital and surplus requirements; and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers. in addition, changes in political party or administrations at the state, federal or country level may change the attitude towards healthcare programs.
additionally, the taxes and fees paid to federal, state and local governments may increase due to several factors, including:  enactment of, changes to, or interpretations of tax laws and regulations, audits by governmental authorities, geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets.
our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio (hbr) or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels. in certain circumstances, our plans may be required to return premium back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or hbr does not meet the minimum requirement. other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue.
the governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards. for example, under health reform legislation, congress authorized cms and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care. participation in these demonstration programs is subject to cms approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation, including meeting certain performance requirements. our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs. specifically, several of our medicaid contracts require us to maintain a medicare health plan. although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business, failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties. also, states may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs, or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
in addition, as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries, we face political, economic, legal, compliance, regulatory, operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction. these foreign regulatory requirements with respect to, among other items, environmental, tax, licensing, intellectual property, privacy, data protection, investment, capital, management control, labor relations, and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses. in addition, we are subject to u.s. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of u.s.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the foreign corrupt practices act. our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the united states or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management (pbm) and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
we provide pbm and specialty pharmacy services through our envolve pharmacy solutions product. each business is subject to federal and state laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. they also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy, which subjects them to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. in addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices, including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies, and the use of average wholesale prices.
our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers, including with respect to the pricing of new specialty and generic drugs. in addition, our pbm and specialty pharmacy businesses could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies, including in connection with the risks inherent in the authorization, compounding, packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products. disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
if any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed or we receive an adverse review, audit or investigation, our business will suffer.
we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance programs. we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate. our government contracts are generally intended to run for three years and may be extended for additional years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so. when our contracts expire, they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers, and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended. competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing. even if our responsive bids are successful, the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contracts being less profitable than we had anticipated. further, our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility, enrollment and dis-enrollment processes for covered services, eligible providers, periodic financial and informational reporting, quality assurance, timeliness of claims payment and agreement to maintain a medicare plan in the state and financial standards and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies.
we are also subject to various reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies and applicable laws and regulations. any adverse review, audit or investigation could result in: cancellation of our contracts; refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts; imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions on us; loss of our right to participate in various programs; increased difficulty in selling our products and services; or loss of one or more of our licenses.
if any of our government contracts are terminated, not renewed, renewed on less favorable terms, or not renewed on a timely basis, or we have an adverse review, audit or investigation, our business will suffer, our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected.
ineffectiveness of state-operated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business.
our health plans rely on other state-operated systems or subcontractors to qualify, solicit, educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans. the effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plan's enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period. when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility, new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans, or chooses new subcontractors, there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans.
our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity.
we maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities, which are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers' credit ratings is reduced. as a result, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments, which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities, or create disruptions in our business.
our growth strategy includes the acquisition of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses, contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and start-up operations in new markets or new products in existing markets. although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire, it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions, or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability. we also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned.
in connection with start-up operations, we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue. for example, in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions, we must first establish a provider network, have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims. we may experience delays in operational start dates. as a result of these factors, start-up operations may decrease our profitability. in addition, we are planning to expand our business internationally and we will be subject to additional risks, including, but not limited to, political risk, an unfamiliar regulatory regime, currency exchange risk and exchange controls, cultural and language differences, foreign tax issues, and different labor laws and practices.
if we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy, our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed.
if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us, we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines.
we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on risk reimbursement. in order to diversify our business, we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans, but to programs operated by third-parties. some of these third-party programs may compete with us in some markets, and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us. in any event, the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs. our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to third-parties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy.
adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms.
the securities and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption over the past several years. the availability of credit, from virtually all types of lenders, has at times been restricted. in the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses, fund subsidiary surplus requirements, make payments on or refinance our indebtedness, pay capital expenditures, or fund acquisitions, our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant, particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility.
our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, and perceptions of our financial prospects. similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. if a combination of these factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.
if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us, we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy.
we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries. as part of normal operations, we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations. these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of, or notification to, state regulators. if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries' request to pay dividends, the funds available to us would be limited, which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy.
we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states, and our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states.
operations in a limited number of states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date. if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed, our revenues could decrease materially. our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions, economic conditions and similar factors in those states. for example, states we currently serve may bid out their medicaid program through a request for proposal process. our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business.
competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve.
we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks, benefits provided and quality of service. we compete with numerous types of competitors, including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided. in addition, the impact of healthcare reform legislation and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors.
some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do. in addition, significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry, as well as complementary industries, such as the hospital, physician, pharmaceutical, medical device and health information systems businesses. to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve, as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise, our ability to retain or increase members and providers, or maintain or increase our revenue growth, pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected.
if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks, our profitability may be harmed.
our profitability depends, in large part, upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers. our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians, specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice. we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably. healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations.
in any particular market, physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. in some markets, certain healthcare providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. in addition, accountable care organizations, practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape. such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our operations, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. provider networks may consolidate, resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment. in addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected.
from time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate non-cancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us. in addition, we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action lawsuits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures, and we may be subject to similar lawsuits. regardless of whether any lawsuits brought against us are successful or have merit, they will still be time-consuming and costly and could distract our management's attention. as a result, we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively. if we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms, our profitability may be harmed.
we may be unable to attract, retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel.
we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. we would be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management. while we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team, these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us. our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours. competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these personnel. if we are unable to attract, retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel, executives and senior management, our business and financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be harmed.
if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively, our operations could be disrupted.
our operations depend significantly on effective information systems. the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in, among other things, monitoring utilization and other cost factors, processing provider claims, and providing data to our regulators. our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications, claims status and other information. our information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements. we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems' capabilities. if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems, we could suffer, among other things, operational disruptions, loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members, regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses. in addition, our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control, including acts of nature, such as earthquakes or fires, or acts of terrorists.
from time to time, we may become involved in costly and time-consuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which require significant attention from our management.
we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business, including, without limitation, medical malpractice claims. due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management, and could therefore harm our business and financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
an impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations.
we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. changes in business strategy, government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future. our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on, among other things, legal factors, market conditions, and operational performance. for example, the non-renewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment. if an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs.
if we fail to comply with applicable privacy, security, and data laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
as part of our normal operations, we collect, process and retain confidential member information. we are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information, including the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa) and the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act and the gramm-leach-bliley act, which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use. certain of our businesses are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard, which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities. despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. in the past, we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date. however, future data breaches could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage, interrupt our operations and damage our reputation, subject us to state or federal agency review and could also result in enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
in addition, hipaa broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies.  hipaa created civil penalties for, among other things, billing for medically unnecessary goods or services.  hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse, including civil and, in some instances, criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy, security and electronic transmission of protected health information.  the hitech act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information, providing enhanced penalties for hipaa violations, and granting enforcement authority to states' attorneys general in addition to the hhs office for civil rights.  it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa, which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules. in addition, hhs has announced that it will continue its audit program to assess hipaa compliance efforts by covered entities with a focus on security risk assessments. although we are not aware of hhs plans to audit any of our covered entities, an audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
under hipaa, health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format. penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements. the transaction standards were modified to version 5010 prior to the implementation of the icd-10 coding system. while we transitioned to the icd-10 coding system in october 2015, if unforeseen circumstances arise, it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance. in addition, if some providers continue to use icd-9 codes on claims after october 1, 2015, we may have to reject such claims, which may lead to claim resubmissions, increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction. further, providers may use icd-10 codes differently than they used icd-9 codes in the past, which could result in higher costs and reimbursement levels, or lost revenues under risk adjustment. as a result, the changes and complications associated with the transition to icd-10 may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
if we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
companies involved in public health care programs are often the subject of fraud and abuse investigations. the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change. violations of fraud and abuse laws applicable to us could result in civil monetary penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment, and/or exclusion from participation in medicaid, medicare, other federal health care programs and federally funded state health programs. fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities, including kickbacks for referral of members, billing for unnecessary medical services, improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights. these fraud and abuse laws include the federal false claims act, which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal false claims act. in addition, the deficit reduction act of 2005 encourages states to enact state-versions of the federal false claims act that establish liability to the state for false and fraudulent medicaid claims and that provide for, among other things, claims to be filed by qui tam relators. federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting health care fraud and abuse a priority. in the event we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, including as a result of cyber attacks, could have an adverse effect on our business.
information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state agents. our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks.
security breaches may arise from external or internal threats. external breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain, attempting to cause harm to our operations, or intending to obtain competitive information. we experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis. we maintain a rigorous system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs; however, our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks. internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees, consultants or third party service providers. any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information, financial data, competitively sensitive information, or other proprietary data, whether by us or a third party, could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.
consummation of the merger with health net is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and certain other conditions and we cannot predict when or if such conditions will be satisfied or waived or if, in connection with the receipt of necessary approvals, regulators will impose conditions on us that have an adverse effect on our business.
consummation of the merger with health net is subject to receipt of certain remaining regulatory approvals and certain other conditions, including, among others:
•   certain filings or consents required for the consummation of the merger and the other transactions under applicable state and foreign insurance and health care regulatory laws having been made or obtained; and
•   certain other customary conditions.
we cannot provide any assurance that the merger will be completed, that there will not be a delay in the completion of the merger or that all or any of the anticipated benefits of the merger will be realized. any delay could also, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the merger. in the event the merger agreement is terminated or the transaction is materially delayed for any reason, the price of our common stock may be impacted. regulatory authorities reviewing the merger may refuse to permit the merger or may impose restrictions or conditions on the merger that may adversely affect the company if the merger is completed.
we may be unable to successfully integrate our business with health net and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.
the success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of the company and health net, which currently operate as independent public companies, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the combination. if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed.
the merger involves the integration of health net's business with our existing business, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. we have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope to the proposed merger. the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation:
•   the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of management's attention to the merger;
•   maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;
•   the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;
•   retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships;
•   consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations;
•   coordinating geographically separate organizations;
•   unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;
•   unanticipated changes in federal or state laws or regulations, including the aca and the health care education affordability reconciliation act and any regulations enacted thereunder; and
•   unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger.
many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
we and health net are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two companies following the merger and have not yet fully determined the exact nature of how the businesses and operations of the two companies will be combined after the merger. the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.
our financial results after the merger will depend on our ability to maintain our and health net's business and operational relationships.
a substantial portion of each of our and health net's revenues are received under contracts with states. our success following the merger will depend in part on our ability to maintain these state contracts and other business and operational relationships, including those of health net. health net's state contracts and other business and operational relationships may have termination or other rights that may be triggered by the merger, or the states or other business and operational relationships may decide not to renew their existing relationships with health net or, after the merger, with us. if health net (prior to the completion of the merger) and we (after the completion of the merger) are unable to maintain these contracts and other business and operational relationships, our financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected.
we are expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the merger and the integration of health net.
we are expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the merger and the integration of health net. there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, revenue management, marketing and benefits. in addition, the businesses of centene and health net will continue to maintain a presence in st. louis, missouri and woodland hills, california, respectively. the substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses related to the merger (including financing of the merger), facilities and systems consolidation costs. we may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. we will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business, and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs. additionally, as a result of the merger, rating agencies may take negative actions with regard to our credit ratings. this may increase our costs in connection with the financing of the merger. these incremental transaction and merger-related costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs.
failure to complete the merger could impact our stock price and our future business and financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
if the merger is not completed or our financing for the transaction becomes unavailable, our ongoing business and financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially affected and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:
•   depending on the reasons leading to such termination we could be liable to health net for termination fees in connection with the termination of the merger agreement;
•   while the merger agreement is in force, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies;
•   the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects, and is positively affected by, a market assumption that the transactions contemplated by the merger will be completed; and
•   matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, whether or not the merger is completed, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us.
in addition, if the merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our providers, members and employees. we may also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement. if the merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and may materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the price of our common stock.
the market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the merger with health net.
the market price of the common stock of our company may decline as a result of the merger if, among other things, we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of health net's business with ours are not realized, or if the transaction costs related to the merger are greater than expected, or if the financing related to the transaction is on unfavorable terms. the market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the merger on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.
the merger will substantially reduce the percentage ownership interests of our current stockholders; it may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.
our stockholders have the right to vote in the election of our board of directors and on certain other matters affecting the company. if the merger is completed we will pay approximately $5.5 billion and health net's stockholders are expected to hold approximately 29% of the common stock of the company after the merger. as a result, if the merger is completed, our pre-merger stockholders will own a smaller proportion of our outstanding common stock than the proportion of our outstanding common stock they owned before the merger and, as a result, they will have less influence on our management and policies following the merger than they now have on our management and policies. we currently anticipate that the merger will be accretive to our earnings per share. this expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change. we could also encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the merger, or unforeseen liabilities or other issues existing or arising with the business of health net or otherwise resulting from the merger. all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock.
uncertainties associated with the merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.
centene and health net are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. the combined company's success after the completion of the merger will depend in part upon the ability of centene and health net to retain key management personnel and other key employees. prior to completion of the merger, current and prospective employees of centene and health net may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the completion of the merger, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of centene and health net to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. in addition, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of centene and health net to the same extent that centene and health net have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees.
the future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the merger.
following the completion of the merger, the size of the combined company's business will be significantly larger than the current size of either centene's or health net's respective businesses. the combined company's ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon management's ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two discrete companies, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity. there can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.
upon completion of the merger, the combined company expects to incur approximately $2,382 million in additional indebtedness. the combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of approximately $4,136 million, which is greater than the current indebtedness of centene prior to the merger. the increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio of the combined company in comparison to that of centene on a historical basis will have the effect, among other things, of reducing the flexibility of centene to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs.

revenues and revenue recognition our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate. we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts. we generally receive premium payments and recognize premium revenue during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. in some instances, our base premiums are subject to an adjustment, or risk score, based on the acuity of our membership. generally, the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's membership. some contracts allow for additional premiums associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries.
our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels. in certain circumstances, our plans may be required to return premium to the state in the event profits exceed established levels. we recognize reductions in revenue in the current period for these programs. other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue. for performance-based contracts, we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance.
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states, which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data. these eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequently adjusted in the period known. we continuously review and update those estimates as new information becomes available.  it is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments, which could be significant, to these estimates.
our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state programs, healthcare organizations, and other commercial organizations, as well as from our own subsidiaries. revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services.
premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue. premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management's judgment of the collectibility of these accounts. as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided, the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.
some states enact premium taxes, similar assessments and provider and hospital pass-through payments, collectively, premium taxes, and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses. additionally, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the affordable care act annual health insurer fee (hif). the company recognizes revenue associated with the hif on a straight line basis when we have binding agreements for the reimbursement of the fee, including the "gross-up" to reflect the hifs non-tax deductible nature. we exclude the hif and premium taxes from our key ratios as we believe they are a pass-through of costs and not indicative of our operating performance. collectively, this revenue is recorded as premium tax and hif revenue in the consolidated statement of operations.
the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) deploys a risk adjustment model that retroactively apportions medicare premiums paid according to health severity and certain demographic factors. the model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions. under this risk adjustment methodology, cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events. the company estimates the amount of risk adjustment based upon the diagnosis and pharmacy data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms and records revenues on a risk adjusted basis.
operating expenses medical costs medical costs include payments to physicians, hospitals, and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims. medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported, or ibnr, and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims. we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate. the assumptions we consider include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, healthcare service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to medicaid fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims.
our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available. as more complete information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimate, and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified.
additionally, we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis. the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability. we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability. we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information, together with management's judgment, to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs.
while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate, it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates. accordingly, we cannot assure you that medical costs will not materially differ from our estimates.
results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred. the health benefits ratio, or hbr, represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues (excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues) and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided.
cost of services cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager and specialty pharmacy's external revenues and certain direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our service revenues. these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals who provide the services and associated expenses.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses, or g&a, primarily reflect wages and benefits, including stock compensation expense, and other administrative costs associated with our health plans, specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units. our major centralized functions are finance, information systems and claims processing. g&a expenses also include business expansion costs, such as wages and benefits for administrative personnel, contracting costs, and information technology buildouts, incurred prior to the commencement of a new contract or health plan.
the g&a expense ratio represents g&a expenses as a percentage of premium and service revenues, and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues.
health insurer fee the health insurer fee reflects the annual fee mandated by the aca to health insurers. the fee is determined based on our premium revenues in the previous year. each health insurer's fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee. market share is based on commercial, medicare, and medicaid premium revenue.
other income (expense) consists principally of investment income from cash and investments, earnings in equity method investments, and interest expense on debt.
discontinued operations our subsidiary, kentucky spirit health plan (kshp), ceased serving medicaid members in kentucky as of july 6, 2013. accordingly, the results of operations for kshp are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. the following discussion and analysis is presented primarily in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified.
premium and service revenues premium and service revenues increased 36% in the year ended december 31, 2015 over the corresponding period in 2014 primarily as a result of the impact from expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly, florida, illinois, indiana, louisiana, mississippi, ohio and texas. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we received premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1% composite change across all of our markets.
operating expenses medical costs results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred. the health benefits ratio, or hbr, represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues (excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues) and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided. the table below depicts the hbr for our membership by member category for the year ended december 31,:
specialty services                      85.8          85.5
the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31, 2015 of 88.9% was a decrease of 40 basis points over the comparable period in 2014. the decrease compared to last year is primarily attributable to improvement in medical expense in the high acuity populations (ltc/mmp) and membership growth in medicaid expansion programs and health insurance marketplace, which operate at a lower hbr than traditional medicaid businesses.
cost of services cost of services increased by $341 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014. this was primarily due to growth in the acariahealth business. the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31, 2015, was 86.4% compared to 87.1% in 2014.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses, or g&a, increased by $512 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the corresponding period in 2014.  this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded approximately $27 million of health net merger related expenses, which reduced our diluted earnings per share by $0.14.
during the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a gain of $10 million on the settlement of contingent consideration related to the chs transaction. we also recorded expense of $10 million for a contribution to our charitable foundation during the first quarter of 2015.
also during 2015, we experienced higher than anticipated opt-out rates and member attrition in the new michigan dual demonstration program, resulting in lower than expected membership and lower blended premium rates. as a result, the fair value of estimated contingent consideration was reduced from $50 million to $16 million, and we recorded a gain of $34 million in general and administrative expenses. in connection with the lower membership and revenue outlook, we conducted an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, resulting in a reduction of goodwill and intangible assets of $38 million which was recorded in general and administrative expenses. the company's initial allocation of fair value resulted in goodwill and intangible assets of $52 million. at december 31, 2015, the company had goodwill of $11 million and other identifiable intangible assets of $1 million, net of $2 million of amortization, remaining on the balance sheet.
the consolidated g&a expense ratio for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 was 8.6% and 8.4%, respectively.  the g&a ratio for the year ended december 31, 2015 was 8.5% excluding the impact of the health net merger related expenses. the increase over prior year is primarily related to the expansion of our health insurance marketplace business which operates at a higher g&a ratio and incurred higher open enrollment costs in the fourth quarter of the current year.
health insurer fee during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recorded $215 million of non-deductible expense for the affordable care act (aca) annual health insurer fee, compared to $126 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2015, we recorded $344 million in premium tax and health insurer fee revenue associated with the accrual for the reimbursement of the fee, compared to $195 million in 2014.
the following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended december 31, ($ in millions):
the increase in investment income in 2015 reflects an increase in investment balances over 2014 and improved performance of certain equity investments. interest expense increased during the year ended december 31, 2015 by $8 million primarily reflecting the issuance of $300 million of senior notes in april 2014 and the issuance of an additional $200 million in senior notes in january 2015.
income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2015 was 48.6% compared to 42.9% in 2014. the effective tax rate is higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily as a result of the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee expense.

managed care premium and service revenues increased 37% in the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily as a result of expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly florida, illinois, indiana, louisiana, mississippi, ohio and texas. earnings from operations increased $160 million between years primarily reflecting growth in the business.
specialty services premium and service revenues increased 47% in the year ended december 31, 2015, resulting primarily from increased service associated with membership growth in the managed care segment and growth in our pharmacy businesses. earnings from operations increased $81 million in the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily reflecting growth in the specialty services provided to our increased managed care membership.
premium and service revenues premium and service revenues increased 49% in the year ended december 31, 2014 over the corresponding period in 2013 as a result of expansions in florida, ohio, washington, texas and illinois, growth in the acariahealth business, the addition of the california and new hampshire operations and our participation in the health insurance marketplaces. during the year ended december 31, 2014 we received premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1% composite increase across all of our markets.

specialty services                      85.5          85.4
the consolidated hbr for the year ended december 31, 2014, of 89.3% was an increase of 70 basis points over the comparable period in 2013. the increase compared to last year is primarily attributable to an increase in complex care membership over the prior year.
cost of services cost of services increased by $953 million in the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in 2013. this was primarily due to the acquisition of and growth in our acariahealth business as well as the acquisition of u.s. medical management. the cost of service ratio for the year ended december 31, 2014, was 87.1% compared to 87.7% in 2013.
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses, or g&a, increased by $383 million in the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to the corresponding period in 2013. this was primarily due to expenses for additional staff and facilities to support our membership growth.
the consolidated g&a expense ratio for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was 8.4% and 8.8%, respectively. the year over year decrease in the g&a ratio reflects the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues in 2014, offset by the acquisition of u.s. medical management and start up of health insurance marketplaces which operate at higher g&a ratios.
health insurer fee during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded $126 million of non-deductible expense for the affordable care act (aca) annual health insurer fee. as of december 31, 2014, we had received signed agreements representing virtually all of the total revenue associated with the reimbursement of the aca insurer fee including the related gross-up for the associated income tax effects. as a result, we recorded $195 million in premium tax and health insurer fee revenue associated with the reimbursement of the fee.
the following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended december 31, ($ in millions):
the increase in investment income in 2014 reflects an increase in investment balances over 2013 and improved performance of certain equity investments. interest expense increased during the year ended december 31, 2014 by $8 million reflecting the issuance of an additional $300 million in senior notes in april 2014 and a higher level of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.
income tax expense our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 was 42.9% compared to 39.8% in 2013. the increase is due to the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee which increased our effective tax rate. this was partially offset by a reduction of tax expense associated with the compensation deduction limitation. during 2014, the irs issued final regulations related to the compensation deduction limitation applicable to certain health insurance providers. accordingly, we reversed previously recorded tax expense of $14 million for prior years resulting in a decrease in the effective tax rate which offset the health insurer fee impact. as a result, we no longer believe the deduction limitation applies.

cash flows provided by operating activities normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  cash flows from operating activities for 2015 were $658 million, 1.8 times net earnings, compared to $1,223 million in 2014. the cash provided by operations in 2015 and 2014 was primarily related to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the business, partially offset by increases in premium and related receivables.
cash flows from operating activities for 2014 increased to $1,223 million, compared to $382 million in 2013. operating cash flows in 2014 significantly benefited from the 49% premium and service revenue growth, which resulted in increased medical claims liabilities. in addition, 2014 uniquely benefited from an increase in payables associated with various programs requiring a return of premium to state customers.  cash flows from operating activities benefited in 2013 due to an increase in net earnings and growth in our business.
cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states.  states may prepay the following month premium payment, which we record as unearned revenue, or they may delay our premium payment, which we record as a receivable.  we typically receive capitation payments monthly, however the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period.
the reimbursement of the hif from our state customers may be settled as a separate payment or monthly in combination with our other premium payments. the vast majority of our state customers are settling the reimbursement through a separate payment after verification of each state's portion of our hif, resulting in an increase in premium and related receivables at december 31, 2015. during 2015, we paid the 2015 annual hif totaling $220 million. this negatively impacted our cash flows as we have not been reimbursed from the majority of our state customers. similarly, during 2014, we paid the 2014 annual hif invoice totaling $126 million. the table below details the impact to cash flows from operations from the timing of payments from our states ($ in millions).

cash flows used in investing activities investing activities used cash of $813 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, and $848 million in the comparable period in 2014.  cash flows used in investing activities in 2015 primarily consisted of additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments and capital expenditures.
in january 2015, we sold a 25% ownership interest in celtic insurance company. no gain or loss was recognized on the sale of the ownership interest. celtic insurance company is included in the managed care segment. under the terms of the agreement, we entered into a put agreement with the noncontrolling interest holder to purchase the noncontrolling interest at a later date.
cash flows used in investing activities in 2014 primarily consisted of additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments, the acquisition of u.s. medical management and chs, an equity investment in ribera salud and capital expenditures. we completed the acquisition of u.s. medical management for $213 million in total consideration. the transaction was financed through a combination of centene common stock as well as $80 million of cash. we also completed a transaction with chs for initial cash consideration of $56 million as well as common stock. additionally, we purchased a noncontrolling interest in ribera salud, s.a. (ribera salud), a spanish health management group for $17 million. during 2013, our investing activities primarily related to additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments, the acquisition of acariahealth and capital expenditures. we completed the acquisition of acariahealth for $142 million in total consideration. the transaction was financed through a combination of centene common stock as well as $67 million of cash.
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity, preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our guidelines. net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases, sales and maturities. as of december 31, 2015, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with an average duration of 2.9 years.  these securities generally are actively traded in secondary markets and the reported fair market value is determined based on recent trading activity, recent trading activity in similar securities and other observable inputs. our investment guidelines comply with the regulatory restrictions enacted in each state. we had unregulated cash and investments of $78 million at december 31, 2015, compared to $85 million at december 31, 2014.
we spent $150 million, $103 million and $68 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, on capital expenditures for system enhancements and market expansions.
cash flows provided by financing activities our financing activities provided cash of $305 million, $198 million and $154 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  financing activities in 2015, 2014 and 2013 are discussed below.
during 2015, our financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of senior debt and an additional $150 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. in january 2015, we issued an additional $200 million of 4.75% senior notes due may 15, 2022 at par (add on notes). in connection with the january 2015 issuance, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $200 million (2015 swap agreements) that are scheduled to expire on may 15, 2022. under the 2015 swap agreements, we receive a fixed rate of 4.75% and pay a variable rate of libor plus a spread adjusted quarterly, which allows us to adjust the $200 million notes to a floating rate. we do not hold or issue any derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes.
in april 2014, pursuant to a shelf registration statement, we issued $300 million 4.75% senior notes due may 15, 2022 at par. interest is paid semi-annually in may and november. in connection with the issuance, we entered into $300 million notional amount of interest rate swap agreements (2014 swap agreements) that are scheduled to expire may 15, 2022. under the 2014 swap agreements, we receive a fixed rate of 4.75% and pay a variable rate of libor plus a spread adjusted quarterly, which allows us to adjust the $300 million notes to a floating rate. we do not hold or issue any derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes.
during 2013, our financing activities primarily related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility, the sale of $15 million of common stock to fund the escrow account for the acquisition of acariahealth and the repayment of a mortgage note.
in may 2013, we entered into a new unsecured $500 million revolving credit facility and terminated our previous $350 million revolving credit facility. borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates, the federal funds rate or the prime rate. the agreement has a maturity date of june 1, 2018, provided it will mature 90 days prior to the maturity date of the 5.75% senior notes due 2017 if such notes are not refinanced (or extended) or certain financial conditions are not met, including carrying $100 million of unrestricted cash on deposit.
liquidity metrics the $500 million revolving credit agreement contains non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, maximum debt-to-ebitda ratios and minimum tangible net worth. we are required not to exceed a maximum debt-to-ebitda ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. as of december 31, 2015, we had $225 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants. as of december 31, 2015, there were no limitations on the availability under the revolving credit agreement as a result of the debt-to-ebitda ratio.
we had outstanding letters of credit of $47 million as of december 31, 2015, which were not part of our revolving credit facility. we also had letters of credit for $50 million (valued at the december 31, 2015 conversion rate), or €46 million, representing our proportional share of the letters of credit issued to support ribera salud's outstanding debt which are a part of the revolving credit facility. collectively, the letters of credit bore interest at 1.55% as of december 31, 2015. in addition, we had outstanding surety bonds of $305 million as of december 31, 2015.
the indenture governing our senior notes contains non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.
at december 31, 2015, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of negative $24 million, compared to $51 million at december 31, 2014.  we manage our short term and long term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short term requirements as needed.
at december 31, 2015, our debt to capital ratio, defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity, was 36.0%, compared to 33.5% at december 31, 2014.  excluding the $67 million non-recourse mortgage note, our debt to capital ratio was 34.7% as of december 31, 2015, compared to 31.7% at december 31, 2014.  we utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure, among others, of our leverage and financial flexibility.
we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 8 million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. we have 3 million available shares remaining under the program for repurchases as of december 31, 2015. no duration has been placed on the repurchase program. we reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time. we did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2015, 2014 or 2013.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we received dividends of $11 million, $50 million, and $18 million, respectively, from our regulated subsidiaries.
2016 expectations in early 2016, we expect to complete the merger with health net, a publicly traded managed care organization that delivers health care services through health plans and government-sponsored managed care plans, for approximately $5.5 billion. in connection with the upcoming closing of the merger, in february 2016, our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary (escrow issuers) issued approximately $1.4 billion 5.625% senior notes due 2021 at par and $1.0 billion 6.125% senior notes due 2024 at par. the transaction will be financed through a combination of borrowings on our revolving credit facility, existing cash on hand, the $2.4 billion february debt issuance, and approximately $2.8 billion in shares of centene common stock. the proceeds of the debt issuance will be held in escrow until the closing of the health net merger. if the health net merger is not consummated, the escrow issuer will be required to redeem each series of notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series of notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
upon execution of the merger agreement, the company negotiated the terms of a new unsecured $1,000 million revolving credit facility with its banking syndicate. the new $1,000 million revolving credit facility is effective upon the closing of the merger and the existing $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility will be terminated simultaneously.
including the effects of potential contributions and expenditures related to health net, we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $250 million during 2016 associated with our growth and spend approximately $330 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements, integration, and market expansions. these capital contributions are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation in 2016 and borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
in january 2016, the company announced an ongoing comprehensive internal search for six hard drives that were unaccounted for in its inventory of approximately 26,000 information technology (it) devices.  this incident resulted from an employee not following established procedures on storing it hardware.  in the process of completing its investigation, in february 2016, the company received an admission from an employee to placing the six hard drives in a locked receptacle for secure destruction. as a result, the company satisfied itself and concluded its investigation.
based on our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes future contractual obligations. these obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances. our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes, credit facility, mortgages and capital leases. the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts. the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows (in millions):
operating lease obligations                315                      58                     109                 78                       70
1 our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015, includes $170 million of other long term liabilities. this consists primarily of long term deferred income taxes, liabilities under our deferred compensation plan, and reserves for uncertain tax positions. these liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain.
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries.  as managed care organizations, these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us.  generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity's level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate.  as of december 31, 2015, our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $2,284 million, compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of $1,195 million.  during the year ended december 31, 2015, we contributed $643 million of statutory capital to our subsidiaries. we estimate our risk based capital, or rbc, percentage (including kshp) to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies, managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage.  as of december 31, 2015, each of our health plans was in compliance with the risk-based capital requirements enacted in those states.
recent accounting pronouncements for this information, refer to note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, included herein.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors.
medical claims liability our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid, or inventory, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, or ibnr, and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period.  we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice.  these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors.
actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions.  moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate.  in many situations, the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving.
we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates. the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, healthcare service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims.
we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated.  for more recent periods, incurred non-inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors.  incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors.  for older periods, we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates.  the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs.  when we commence operations in a new state or region, we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability.  see "risk factors - failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows." these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented.
additionally, we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis. the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability. we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability. we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information, together with management's judgment, to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims.
our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available. as more complete claims information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified. in every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods. we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period. as additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates.
the paid and received completion factors, claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate.  the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31, 2015 data:
completion factors: (1)                                          cost trend factors: (2)
(decrease)increasein factors                   increase          (decrease)increasein factors                   increase
(1)   reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liability caused by changes in completion factors.
(2)   reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liability caused by changes in cost trend factors for the most recent periods.
while we believe our estimates are appropriate, it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates.  for example, a 1% increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by $14 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, excluding the effect of any return of premium, risk corridor, or minimum medical loss ratio programs.  the estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources.
the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows (in millions):
1   days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liability at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year.
medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider.  as a result, the liability generally is described as having a "short-tail," which causes less than 5% of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year.  we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december 31, 2015 will be known by the end of 2016.
changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions. additionally, as a result of minimum hbr and other return of premium programs, approximately $47 million, $26 million and $0 million of the "incurred related to: prior period" was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. further, claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service. changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates.  while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis, medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim. accordingly, any change in behavior, leveling of care, or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result, the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us. additionally, certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member's acuity. in these cases, determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined. because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the volume of claims that we process, we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr.
the following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends:
•   appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions, other inpatient hospital admissions, and observation admissions, in accordance with interqual or other criteria.
•   management of our pre-authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles.
•   emergency room program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non-emergency care away from the costly emergency room setting (through patient education, on-site alternative urgent care settings, etc.)
•   increase emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected patients with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patient's specific healthcare needs.
•   incorporation of disease management which is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma.
•   prenatal and infant health programs utilized in our start smart for your baby outreach service.
goodwill and intangible assets we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets. these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, purchased contract rights, provider contracts, trade names and goodwill. at december 31, 2015, we had $842 million of goodwill and $155 million of other intangible assets.
intangible asset            amortization period purchased contract rights          5 - 15 years provider contracts                 4 - 15 years customer relationships             3 - 15 years trade names                        7 - 20 years developed technology                    5 years
our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired, the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset. our management must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount factor, future utility and other internal and external factors, in determining the estimated fair values. while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results.
goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment. in addition, an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors. these factors include significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider networks and contracts.
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. we generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. however, in certain circumstances, such as recent acquisitions, we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors. the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date, with the exception of reporting units that were recently acquired without excess fair value on the acquisition date.

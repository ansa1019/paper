item 1a.   risk factors the company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global, regional, and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation, operations, and financial performance.
management directs a company-wide integrated risk management (irm) program, with oversight from the company's board of directors. the company's audit committee has the delegated risk management oversight responsibility and receives updates on the risk management processes and key risk factors on a quarterly basis.
the risk factors that follow are the main risks that the irm program focuses on to protect and enhance shareholder value through intentional risk mitigation plans based on management-defined risk limits.
the company, through its business unit, functional, and corporate teams, are continually updating, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating these and other business and compliance risks through the irm program.
the availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the company procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises can be affected by weather conditions, disease, government programs, competition, and various other factors beyond the company's control and could adversely affect the company's operating results.
the availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  additionally, the company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities used by the company in its operations is maintained. these factors have historically caused volatility in the availability and prices of agricultural commodities and, consequently, in the company's operating results and working capital requirements.  reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weather-related factors or other reasons could adversely affect the company's profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limiting the company's ability to procure, transport, store, process, and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner.  for example, a drought in north america in 2012 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased.  high and volatile commodity prices can adversely affect the company's ability to meet its liquidity needs. conversely, if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cyles, price volatility is somewhat diminished. this could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities.
item 1a.   risk factors (continued)
the company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates.
the company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors.  the company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities, workforce, and other materials and supplies.  additionally, competitors offer similar products and services, as well as alternative products and services, to the company's customers.  the company is dependent on being able to generate revenues in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins, profits, and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures and provide cash for operating, working capital, dividend, or capital expenditure needs. competition impacts the company's ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors.  pricing of the company's products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring on-line idled capacity or to build new production capacity.  many of the products bought and sold by the company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities.  the markets for global commodities are highly price competitive and in many cases the commodities are subject to substitution.  significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar, particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries, could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than u.s. products, thereby negatively impacting the competitiveness of the company's significant origination, processing, and export footprint, and the company's operating results. in addition, continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry that could impact the relative competitiveness of the company. to compete effectively, the company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market share, maintaining a high level of product safety and quality, and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions.
fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the company's operating results.
the company's operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices.  the company's processing plants are powered principally by electricity, natural gas, and coal.  the company's transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.  significant increases in the cost of these items, including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases, could adversely affect the company's production costs and operating results.
the company has certain finished products, such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products, or in the case of ethanol, blended into gasoline to increase octane content. therefore, the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other octane enhancers.  a significant decrease in the price of gasoline, diesel fuel, or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the company's ethanol and biodiesel and could adversely affect the company's revenues and operating results.
the company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities, which could adversely affect the company's operating results.
the company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas. while 54 percent of the company's processing plants and 70 percent of its procurement facilities are located in the united states, the company also has significant operations in both developed areas (such as western europe, canada, brazil) and emerging market areas (such as eastern europe, asia, portions of south and central america, the middle east, and africa). one of the company's strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas such as asia, eastern europe, the middle east, and africa. both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns, including decreased demand for the company's products, and reduced availability of credit, or declining credit quality of the company's suppliers, customers, and other counterparties. in addition, emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including, but not limited to, logistics limitations or delays, labor-related challenges, limitations or regulations affecting trade flows (such as concerning genetically modified organisms), local currency concerns, and other economic and political instability.  political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes, fees, etc. economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the company's operating results and ability to execute its long-term business strategies, thus reducing the company's overall market value.
item 1a.   risk factors (continued)
government policies, mandates, and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries; regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses; and political instability could adversely affect the company's operating results.
agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, and regulations. governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, product safety and labeling, renewable fuels, and low carbon fuel mandates, can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded, the volume and types of imports and exports, the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials, the viability and volume of production of certain of the company's products, and industry profitability.  for example, changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel, including but not limited to changes in the renewable fuel standard program under the energy independence and security act of 2007 in the united states, can have an impact on the company's operating results.  international trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the dodd-frank act, consumer protection act, and the european market infrastructure regulation, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, and could adversely affect the company's agricultural commodity risk management practices as well as the company's futures commission merchant business. future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the company's products; restrict the company's ability to do business in its existing and target markets; and adversely affect the company's revenues and operating results.
the company's operating results could be affected by changes in other governmental policies, mandates, and regulations including monetary, fiscal and environmental policies, laws, regulations, acquisition approvals, and other activities of governments, agencies, and similar organizations.  these risks include but are not limited to changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency exchange fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, enforceability of legal agreements and judgments, adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes, and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases.  international risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the company's ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect the company's revenues and operating results.
the company's strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio. government policies, including anti-trust and competition law, trade restrictions, food safety regulations, and other government regulations and mandates, can impact the company's ability to execute this strategy successfully.
the company is subject to industry-specific risks which could adversely affect the company's operating results.
the company is subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, product safety or quality; shifting consumer preferences; federal, state, and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; socially acceptable farming practices; environmental, health and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims.  the liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the company.  in addition, negative publicity caused by product liability and food safety matters may damage the company's reputation.  the occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect the company's revenues and operating results.
certain of the company's merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.  the company is subject to risks associated with economic or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses, including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry.  an outbreak of disease could adversely affect demand for the company's products used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.  a decrease in demand for ingredients in livestock and poultry feed could adversely affect the company's revenues and operating results.
item 1a.   risk factors (continued)
the company is subject to numerous laws, regulations, and mandates globally which could adversely affect the company's operating results and forward strategy.
the company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in 165 countries.  the company is required to comply with the numerous and broad-reaching laws and regulations administered by united states federal, state and local, and foreign governmental authorities.  the company must comply with other general business regulations such as accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, environmental, and handling and production of regulated substances.  the company frequently faces challenges from u.s. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the company.  as examples, the company has received large tax assessments from tax authorities in brazil and argentina, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the company covering various prior periods.  any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation.
the production of the company's products requires the use of materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances, including greenhouse gas emissions.  although the company has programs in place throughout the organization globally to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, failure to comply with these laws and regulations can have serious consequences, including civil, administrative, and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the company's reputation, business, cash flows, and results of operations.
in addition, changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations, for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws, may require the company to modify existing processing facilities and/or processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results.
the company is exposed to potential business disruption, including but not limited to disruption of transportation services, supply of non-commodity raw materials used in its processing operations, and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, and accidents which could adversely affect the company's operating results.
the company's operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services.  a disruption in transportation services could result in difficulties supplying materials to the company's facilities and impair the company's ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner.  the company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively.  if access to these navigable waters is interrupted, the company's operating results could be adversely affected.  in addition, if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials, such as water or certain chemicals used in the company's processing operations, are not available, the company's business could be disrupted.  any major lack of available water for use in certain of the company's processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results.  certain factors which may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the company's control including, but not limited to, disruptions resulting from weather, economic conditions, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of materials, interruption of energy supply, and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions.
the assets and operations of the company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism, for example, economic adulteration of the company's products, or war, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, and fires. the potential effects of these conditions could adversely affect the company's revenues and operating results.
item 1a.   risk factors (continued)
the company's business is capital-intensive in nature and the company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs.  limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the company's operating results.
the company requires significant capital, including access to credit markets from time to time, to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy.  the company's working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.  the company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations and changing safety standards in the industry.  moreover, the expansion of the company's business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital.  access to credit markets and pricing of the company's capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies.  sufficient credit ratings allow the company to access tier one commercial paper markets. if the company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings, access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected.  if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the company's current operations and its growth opportunities which could adversely affect the company's operating results.
the company's risk management strategies may not be effective.
the company's business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.  the company monitors position limits and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks.  the company's monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure.  if these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the company's exposure to these fluctuations, it could adversely affect the company's operating results.
the company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures.
the company has $3.9 billion invested in or advanced to joint ventures and investments over which the company has limited control as to the governance and management activities of these investments.  net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended december 31, 2015 was $5.0 billion.  the company faces certain risks, including risks related to the financial strength of the investment partner; loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit; the inability to implement beneficial management strategies, including risk management and compliance monitoring, with respect to the investment's activities; and the risk that the company may not be able to resolve disputes with the investment partner.  the company may encounter unanticipated operating issues or financial results related to these investments that may impact the company's revenues and operating results.
the company's information technology (it) systems, processes, and sites may suffer interruptions, security breaches, or failures which may affect the company's ability to conduct its business.
the company's operations rely on certain key it systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data connectivity, information and services for internal and external users.  these interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, risk management activities, converting raw materials to finished products, inventory management, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business.  increased it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the company's it systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the company's third party data. the company has put in place security measures to protect itself against cyber-based attacks and disaster recovery plans for its critical systems.  however, if the company's it systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the company's disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the company's revenues, operating results, and financial condition.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview this md&a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
the company is principally engaged in procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  the company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in 165 countries.  the company also processes corn, oilseeds, and wheat into products for food, animal feed, chemical and energy uses.  the company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for our shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities.
the company's operations are organized, managed, and classified into four reportable business segments: agricultural services, corn processing, oilseeds processing, and wild flavors and specialty ingredients.  each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered.  the company's remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as other. see note 17 of item 8 for more information about the company's business segments.
effective january 1, 2015, the company has formed a fourth reportable business segment, wild flavors and specialty ingredients. results of wild flavors and sci, which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, are reported in this segment in addition to results of certain product lines previously reported in the agricultural services, corn processing, and oilseeds processing business segments. prior period results of the product lines previously reported in the other reportable business segments have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
as part of the evolution of the company's strategic plan, the company is currently undertaking a fresh look at the capital intensity of its operations and portfolio, seeking innovative ways to reduce and redeploy capital in its efforts to drive long-term returns, including a strategic review of its u.s. corn dry mills and options for its brazilian sugarcane ethanol business. based on the uncertain outlook of the brazilian sugarcane ethanol business at year-end, the company continues to evaluate all options but doesn't expect to operate the plant after this year's seasonal shutdown. the financial impacts arising from these portfolio actions are described on pages 31 and 33 and in the relevant notes in item 8.
operating performance indicators the company's agricultural services and oilseeds processing operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. therefore, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold. thus, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit.
the company's corn processing operations and wild flavors and specialty ingredients businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. however, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily equal changes in cost of products sold. thus, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.
the company has consolidated subsidiaries in 82 countries.  for the majority of the company's subsidiaries located outside the united states, the local currency is the functional currency. revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into u.s. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. for the majority of the company's business activities in brazil, the functional currency is the u.s. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require conversion to the functional currency. changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the euro, british pound, canadian dollar, and brazilian real, as compared to the u.s. dollar.
the company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, segment operating profit, return on invested capital, ebitda, economic value added, manufacturing expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses. the company's financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. due to these unpredictable factors, the company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
as an agricultural commodity-based business, the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company's operating results. agricultural services was negatively impacted by the ample global supply of agricultural commodities which limited merchandising opportunities, reduced demand for north american grain exports, and moderated commodity prices throughout the year. the increase in global supply was due to several large harvests which built up world grain stocks to historically high levels. in addition, the u.s. dollar continued to be firm against weakening global currencies, particularly those in major crop growing countries such as brazil, argentina, and ukraine. this resulted in margin pressure and decreased north american export volumes most of the year, partially offset by higher domestic grain demand. transportation was also impacted by the decreased north american export volumes as well as lower global freight rates. demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid while co-product prices weakened. ethanol demand remained strong both in north america and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol's continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer. despite strong demand, ethanol margins were weak due to record-high levels of u.s. industry production for most of the year, leading to excess inventory. overall demand for global protein meal and vegetable oil remained strong, especially in north america. south american oilseeds saw significantly higher volumes and margins for grain origination and exports due to the significant depreciation of the brazilian real against the u.s. dollar. lower softseed availability affected seed basis, resulting in lower softseed crushing volumes and weaker margins, particularly in europe. biodiesel demand resulting from international biofuel standards continued to support demand for crude and refined vegetable oil, although demand for biodiesel was softer throughout 2015 due to weaker economic conditions in certain countries. the wild flavors and specialty ingredients business continued to focus on cost synergies and new revenue opportunities amid economic uncertainty in many emerging economies and some softening in demand. customers' interest to develop innovative, healthy, and nutritious food products in response to macro trends in diet and demographics remained strong and continued to grow.
net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased $0.4 billion to $1.8 billion. segment operating profit was down 16%, due primarily to weaker ethanol margins and lower volumes and margins of north american grain exports. corporate results in the current year include a charge of $189 million related to the repurchase of outstanding debt, in addition to a credit of $2 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves, compared to a lifo credit of $245 million in the prior year.
income taxes decreased from $877 million to $438 million due to lower earnings before income taxes and a decreased effective tax rate. the company's effective tax rate for 2015 decreased to 19% compared to 28% for 2014 due primarily to low tax rates on significant one-time gains related to portfolio actions, a $70 million favorable impact of discrete items, mainly the release of a $66 million valuation allowance, and changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings (see note 13 in item 8 for more information).
analysis of statements of earnings processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in metric tons):
(in thousands)             2015   2014                      change oilseeds            33,817            32,208           1,609
the company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to current and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. record volumes of oilseeds were processed during the year, increased from the prior year as a result of the strong demand environment for soybean meal. processed volumes of corn were decreased in response to high ethanol industry production which outpaced demand throughout the year. processed volumes of cocoa beans decreased due to the sale of the global cocoa business in october 2015.

revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes. in periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in oilseeds processing and agricultural services, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.
revenues decreased 17% due principally to lower sales prices ($12.9 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.6 billion). sales prices decreased principally due to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices, in particular prices of soybeans, corn, and wheat, and $5.8 billion in foreign currency translation impacts due to the strength of the u.s. dollar. agricultural services revenues decreased 18% primarily due to lower sales prices ($5.3 billion) and lower sales volumes ($1.3 billion). corn processing revenues decreased 19% due principally to lower sales prices ($1.9 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.4 billion). oilseeds processing revenues decreased 18% due principally to lower sales prices ($5.5 billion) and lower sales volumes ($0.2 billion). wild flavors and specialty ingredients revenues increased 76% due principally to higher sales volumes resulting from the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci, which were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 ($1.2 billion), partially offset by lower prices ($0.2 billion).

cost of products sold decreased $12.8 billion to $63.7 billion due principally to lower average commodity prices, including $5.6 billion from foreign currency translation impacts due to the strength of the u.s. dollar, and lower manufacturing costs. included in cost of products sold is a credit of $2 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of $245 million in the prior year. manufacturing expenses decreased $291 million to $5.5 billion primarily due to lower fuel prices, partially offset by increased employee benefit costs due to the inclusion of the full year costs for wild flavors and sci.
gross profit decreased $0.7 billion, or 16%, to $4.0 billion due principally to lower ethanol margins ($0.6 billion) and foreign currency translation impacts ($0.2 billion). the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci was partially offset by lower credit from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo valuation reserves. these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 33. the decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold.
selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $103 million to $2.0 billion due principally to increased expenses of $219 million related to the inclusion of the full year results of wild flavors and sci in the current year compared to three-month results in the prior year partially offset by decreased pension expense primarily due to a $98 million one-time pension settlement in the prior year.
asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs recognized in the current year of $200 million consisted of long-lived asset impairments of $129 million related to certain oilseeds processing facilities, sugar ethanol facilities in brazil, a facility in the corn processing segment, and capitalized software costs and restructuring and exit costs of $71 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, sugar ethanol facilities in brazil, and other restructuring and exit costs. long-lived asset impairment for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2015 consisted of property, plant, and equipment asset impairments of $70 million in the corn processing segment, $49 million in the oilseeds processing segment, $1 million in the wild flavors and specialty ingredients segment, and $9 million in corporate. asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs recognized in the prior year of $105 million consisted of costs associated with the relocation of the company's global headquarters to chicago, illinois of $16 million, restructuring charges related primarily to the wild flavors acquisition and to the integration of a subsidiary following the acquisition of the minority interest of $48 million, other-than-temporary investment writedown of $6 million, and fixed asset impairments of $35 million.
interest expense declined $29 million to $308 million primarily due to lower interest rates resulting from the issuance of euro-denominated debt and the repurchase of certain of the company's u.s. dollar-denominated outstanding debentures.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $18 million to $390 million primarily due to higher earnings from the company's investment in cip.
other income increased $74 million from $247 million to $321 million. other income in the year ended december 31, 2015 consisted primarily of gain on sales of $256 million related primarily to the sale of the cocoa, chocolate, and lactic businesses, a gain of $212 million on the revaluation of the company's previously held equity investments in north start shipping, minmetal, and eaststarch c.v. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests, and a gain of $62 million on the sale of a 50% interest in the barcarena export terminal facility in brazil to glencore plc, partially offset by a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt in the current year and loss provisions of $45 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in brazil. other income in the year ended december 31, 2014 consisted primarily of gains of $156 million upon the company's effective dilution in the pacificor joint venture and $126 million on the sale of the fertilizer business, partially offset by losses of $102 million on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the wild flavors acquisition.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
agricultural services operating profit decreased 32%. merchandising and handling results decreased on fewer merchandising opportunities and lower margins due to ample global supplies of grain, reduced u.s. export competitiveness during the second half of the year due to the strong u.s. dollar, and a large south american harvest. also contributing to the decrease were the absence of a prior year gain of $17 million related to a partial recovery of a loss provision and a prior year gain of $156 million from the company's effective dilution in the pacificor joint venture, partially offset by a $27 million current year gain on the revaluation of the company's previously held investments in north star shipping and minmetal in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests. milling and other results improved due to higher product margins and strong merchandising results.  transportation results declined due to lower freight rates and volumes driven by reduced u.s. export volumes in the second half of the year.
corn processing operating profit decreased 44%. included in the current year operating profit is approximately $13 million of mark-to-market losses related to hedge timing effects compared to $25 million of gains in the prior year. excluding these items, sweeteners and starches operating profit increased $213 million due principally to the $185 million gain from the revaluation of the company's previously held investment in eaststarch c.v. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest in november 2015. also contributing to the increase were lower raw material costs and good demand relative to supply of products. excluding hedge timing effects, bioproducts operating profit declined by $675 million primarily due to lower industry ethanol margins. strong industry production levels resulted in high industry inventory levels which kept industry margins considerably lower than last year, despite increased domestic and export demand. also contributing to the decrease were restructuring and fixed asset impairment charges of $75 million and loss provisions of $45 million related to the sugar ethanol business in brazil.
oilseeds processing operating profit increased 9%. included in the current year operating profit is $45 million of mark-to-market gains related to cocoa hedge timing effects compared to $17 million of losses in the prior year. crushing and origination operating profit includes a current year gain of $62 million related to the sale of assets to the new barcarena export terminal joint venture in brazil and a prior year gain of $126 million related to the sale of the fertilizer business. excluding these gains, crushing and origination operating profit increased $38 million primarily due to strong north american & european soybean crushing volumes and margins through the first half of the year, driven by strong demand and an ample global bean supply. starting in the third quarter and continuing in the fourth quarter, global soybean crush margins declined as the more competitive argentine meal was anticipated to enter the already well-supplied global markets due to changes in argentine policies. softseed margins and volumes were lower, particularly in europe, resulting from weaker global demand for vegetable oil. large south american corn and soybean harvests also helped support a significant improvement in south america origination results. refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other operating profit declined primarily due to lower south american and european results partially offset by improved margins in north american oil refining operations. excluding hedge timing effects, cocoa and other results increased $149 million. the current year gain of $244 million on the sale of the global cocoa and chocolate business was partially offset by lower earnings due to the sale of these businesses and lower cocoa press margins and peanut processing results. asia results declined due principally to long-lived asset and goodwill impairments partially offset by an increase from the company's share of its results from its equity investee, wilmar.
wild flavors and specialty ingredients operating profit increased due primarily to the acquisitions of wild flavors and sci during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. incremental earnings from these acquisitions were partially offset by lower overall results in the other specialty ingredients businesses due to weakness in many emerging economies and a strong u.s. dollar, which reduced volumes and margins across a number of product lines.
corporate results were a net charge of $988 million in the current period compared to $785 million in the prior period. the effects of changing commodity prices on lifo inventory valuations resulted in a credit of $2 million in the current year compared to a credit of $245 million in the prior year. interest expense - net declined due principally to lower interest rates. unallocated corporate costs increased $19 million due primarily to increased pension expense resulting from the adoption of a new mortality assumption, increased spending on the company's erp program and various strategic business improvement projects, partially offset by lower employee compensation expense. other charges in the current year consisted of a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt, restructuring charges of $29 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, and asset impairment and settlement charges of $24 million. other charges in the prior year consisted of a $102 million loss on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the wild flavors acquisition, costs associated with the relocation of the company's global headquarters to chicago, illinois of $16 million, restructuring charges related to the alfred c. toepfer international integration and other restructuring charges of $15 million, and pension settlement of $98 million. minority interest and other expense in the prior year consisted primarily of a $56 million loss related to the company's equity method investment in cip.

non-gaap financial measures the company uses adjusted earnings per share (eps) and adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (ebitda), non-gaap financial measures as defined by the securities exchange commission, to evaluate the company's financial performance. these performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, gaap financial measures.
adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps adjusted for the effects on reported diluted eps of certain specified items. adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items. the company calculates adjusted ebitda by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.
management believes that adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda are useful measures of the company's profitability and enhance the investor's understanding of the company's financial performance. adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted eps and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under gaap.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
as an agricultural commodity-based business, the company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the company's operating results. demand for global protein meal and vegetable oil remained strong and steady. demand for export of north american corn and soybeans was strong, but logistical challenges during the winter months, including rail delays and river freezes, caused higher costs making u.s. exports less competitive. despite a large harvest in south america, u.s. grain exports continued for longer than normal in 2014 due to slow south american farmer selling. u.s. corn and wheat storage and merchandising opportunities were limited for much of the year until the 2014 record fall harvest. corn sweetener demand was steady. strong u.s. ethanol demand from both domestic and export markets, combined with industry logistical and production challenges in the winter months, led to volatile but strong overall 2014 ethanol margins. south american grain and oilseed origination volumes and margins were challenged by the slow farmer selling. cocoa press margins have continued to improve from last year when margins were negatively impacted by excess capacity.
net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased $0.9 billion to $2.2 billion. segment operating profit was $3.9 billion, up 45%, due primarily to improved corn processing and grain merchandising and handling results. included in the 2014 segment operating profit was a gain of approximately $156 million upon the company's effective dilution in the pacificor (formerly kalama export company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units, a gain of $126 million on the sale of the fertilizer business, long-lived asset impairment charges of $35 million, and wild flavors restructuring charges and acquisition costs of $33 million. in 2013, segment operating profit included a $155 million write-down related to the company's graincorp investment, a $51 million impairment of certain long-lived assets at its brazilian sugar mill, and approximately $27 million of other long-lived asset impairment charges principally in the corn processing segment. excluding these unique items, segment operating profit improved approximately 26% in 2014. corporate costs of $785 million in 2014 were higher by $101 million. included in 2014 costs were losses of $102 million on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the anticipated wild flavors acquisition and $98 million of non-cash pension settlement charges. included in 2013 costs were $54 million of charges related to an anti-corruption settlement, losses of $40 million on australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed graincorp acquisition, $21 million costs related to strategic projects, and costs of $32 million primarily related to asset write-downs and allocations of costs between corporate and the operating segments. in 2014, lifo inventory reserves declined resulting in pretax lifo credits to earnings of $245 million compared to lifo credits of $225 million in 2013. excluding lifo and these other items, corporate costs increased $68 million, which is primarily due to higher enterprise resource planning project, i.t., and other project-related costs. partially offsetting the increase was lower interest expense due principally to lower outstanding long-term debt balances.
the company's effective tax rate for 2014 was 28.0% compared to 33.1% for 2013. the 2014 rate was positively impacted by $47 million of positive discrete tax adjustments and a slight favorable shift in the geographic mix of earnings. the 2013 rate was negatively impacted by valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, partially offset by favorable discrete income tax benefits related to amounts received from the u.s. government in the form of biodiesel credits. excluding these factors, the effective tax rate for 2013 was approximately 30%.
analysis of statements of earnings processed volumes by product for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in metric tons):

revenues in 2014 decreased 10% due principally to lower average sales prices ($8.0 billion) related to a decrease in underlying commodity prices, lower overall sales volumes ($0.7 billion), and changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $0.2 billion partially offset by higher revenues in wild flavors and specialty ingredients ($0.3 billion) due to the acquisition of wild flavors and sci. the decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on cost of products sold. agricultural services revenues decreased 10% due principally to lower average sales prices ($5.2 billion) and partially offset by higher sales volumes ($1.1 billion). corn processing revenues decreased 11% due principally to lower average sales prices ($1.6 billion) partially offset by higher sales volumes ($0.1 billion). oilseeds processing revenues decreased 10% due principally to lower sales volumes for soybeans and soybean meal ($1.9 billion) and lower average sales prices ($1.4 billion).
cost of products sold decreased 11% to $76.4 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. included in 2014 cost of products sold is a credit of $245 million from the effect of decreasing agricultural commodity prices on lifo inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of $225 million in 2013. manufacturing expenses increased $0.2 billion to $5.8 billion mostly due to higher energy costs and higher maintenance costs. higher energy costs were driven by unusually high volatility of natural gas prices during the winter months early in the year due primarily to supply interruptions impacted by the severe winter weather conditions.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
gross profit increased $0.9 billion, or 23%, to $4.8 billion. the increase in gross profit consists principally of stronger margins in ethanol ($0.4 billion), increased margins in cocoa ($0.1 billion), higher u.s. grain export volumes ($0.3 billion), higher volumes and freight rates in barge operations ($0.1 billion), and the inclusion of the results of wild flavors ($0.1 billion), partially offset by lower south american grain origination results ($0.1 billion). these factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 40. the effects of decreasing commodity price changes on lifo inventory valuations had an immaterial impact on gross profit. the decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold.
selling, general, and administrative expenses (sg&a) increased $148 million to $1.9 billion due principally to a $98 million non-cash pretax pension settlement charge related to settling certain u.s. retiree liabilities with lump sum payments and incremental sg&a expenses of $73 million related to the acquired wild flavors and sci businesses, partially offset by the absence of the prior year charge of $54 million related to an anti-corruption settlement. in addition, salaries and benefits and enterprise resource planning project, information technology, and other project-related costs were higher year over year.
asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs of $105 million include $16 million of costs associated with the relocation of the company's global headquarters to chicago, illinois, $48 million of restructuring charges related primarily to the wild flavors acquisition and toepfer integration following the acquisition of the minority interest, other-than-temporary investment writedown of $6 million, and property, plant, and equipment asset impairments of $35 million. the 2013 charges of $259 million were comprised of other-than-temporary impairment charges of $155 million on the company's graincorp investment, asset impairment charges of $51 million related to the company's brazilian sugar milling business, and other impairment charges principally for certain property, plant, and equipment assets totaling $53 million.
interest expense decreased $76 million to $337 million primarily due to lower outstanding long-term debt balances. during february 2014, the company repaid $1.15 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes with available funds.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $39 million to $372 million primarily due to lower earnings from the company's investments in cip and wilmar.
other income increased $194 million to $247 million due principally to a gain of $156 million upon the company's effective dilution in the pacificor (formerly kalama export company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units, a gain of $126 million on the sale of the south american fertilizer business, and the absence of prior year losses of $40 million on australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed graincorp acquisition, partially offset by current period losses of $102 million on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the wild flavors acquisition.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
agricultural services operating profit increased 205%. 2014 results in merchandising and handling include a gain of $156 million upon the company's effective dilution in the pacificor (formerly kalama export company) joint venture, resulting from the contribution of additional assets by another member in exchange for new equity units and asset impairment charges of $14 million. prior year results included an approximately $30 million intercompany insurance-related gain and a $155 million asset impairment charge related to the other than temporary impairment of the company's graincorp investment. excluding these items, merchandising and handling operating profit increased $353 million due principally to higher u.s. grain export volumes and improvement in international merchandising results. transportation operating profit improved due to higher volumes and freight rates in barge operations. milling and other results declined on lower margins and volumes in the milling business for most of 2014 reducing opportunities for grain and feed merchandising.
corn processing operating profit increased 49%. included in the 2014 operating profit is a gain of approximately $25 million for corn hedge timing effects and $15 million of asset impairment charges; while 2013 included a charge of approximately $15 million for corn hedge time effects and $71 million of asset impairment charges. excluding these items, sweeteners and starches operating profit decreased $49 million primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by lower net corn costs. also contributing to the decrease were decreased co-products income, an additional $8 million in bad debt reserve and $7 million of startup costs related to the new sweetener facility in tianjin, china. excluding corn hedge timing effects and asset impairment charges, bioproducts profit in the current year improved by $328 million as solid demand for u.s. ethanol from domestic and export markets, lower net corn costs, and lower industry production volumes early in the year caused by logistical and production challenges combined to drive volatile but overall strong margins.
oilseeds processing operating profit increased 12%. included in the 2014 operating profit is a charge of approximately $17 million for cocoa hedge timing effects compared to a charge of approximately $13 million in the prior year. crushing and origination operating profit increased 4%. included in the 2014 results is a gain on sale of the fertilizer business of $126 million. excluding this gain the crushing and origination operating profit decreased by $93 million primarily due to lower south american grain origination results caused by year-over-year slower farmer-selling, reduced crush margins and lower fertilizer results partially offset by strong soybean and softseed volumes and margins in north america and europe. refining, packaging, biodiesel, and other results improved on good demand and improved margins for refined and packaged oils and improved european biodiesel results. cocoa and other results, including the mark-to-market timing effects discussed above, improved as cocoa press margins significantly increased. asia results declined principally reflecting a decrease from the company's share of its results from its equity investee, wilmar.
wild flavors and specialty ingredients operating profit decreased due primarily to the results of wild flavors and sci, which were acquired by the company in the fourth quarter of 2014. wild flavors' results include $33 million in restructuring charges and acquisition costs and $23 million in additional expense for the amortization of fair value adjustments primarily related to inventories.
other financial operating profit increased mainly due to the absence of an approximately $30 million insurance-related loss in the 2013 which offset the insurance-related gain reported in the agricultural services segment.
corporate results were a net charge of $785 million in 2014 compared to a net charge of $684 million in 2013. the effects of decreasing commodity prices on lifo inventory valuations resulted in a credit of $245 million in 2014 compared to a credit of $225 million in 2013. interest expense - net declined due principally to lower outstanding long-term debt balances. unallocated corporate costs increased primarily due to higher expenses related to the enterprise resource planning project, special strategic projects, and compensation accruals. other charges in 2014 consisted of losses of $102 million on euro foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the anticipated wild flavors acquisition, global headquarters relocation costs of $16 million, integration of a subsidiary following the acquisition of the minority interest and other restructuring charges of $15 million, and pension settlement of $98 million. other charges in 2013 consisted of a $54 million provision related to an anti-corruption settlement, losses of $40 million on australian dollar foreign currency derivative contracts entered into to economically hedge the proposed graincorp acquisition, $21 million of costs related to strategic merger and acquisition projects, and $32 million of costs primarily related to asset write-downs and reallocations of costs from the operating segments to corporate. minority interest and other expense increased primarily due to changes in the elimination of the income attributable to the minority shareholder of a subsidiary.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
non-gaap financial measures the company uses adjusted earnings per share (eps) and adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (ebitda), non-gaap financial measures as defined by the securities exchange commission, to evaluate the company's financial performance. these performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, gaap financial measures.
adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps adjusted for the effects on reported diluted eps of certain specified items. adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items. the company calculates adjusted ebitda by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.
management believes that adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda are useful measures of the company's profitability and enhance the investor's understanding of the company's financial performance. adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted eps and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under gaap.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
liquidity and capital resources a company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  the company's strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops that it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio. the company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of the company's control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. the primary source of funds to finance the company's operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility.  in addition, the company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both u.s. and international markets.
cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion for 2015 compared to $5.0 billion in 2014. working capital changes were a net source of cash of $0.2 billion in the current year compared to $2.3 billion in the prior year. inventories declined approximately $0.9 billion at december 31, 2015 compared to december 31, 2014 due to lower prices partially offset by higher inventory quantities. in 2015, the company made a $0.2 billion voluntary contribution to the u.s. pension plans. no similar contribution was made in 2014. cash used in investing activities was $21 million this year compared to $3.4 billion last year primarily due to capital expenditures and net assets of businesses acquired of $1.6 billion this year compared to $3.7 billion last year and proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of $1.8 billion this compared to $0.4 billion last year. cash used in financing activities was $2.6 billion this year compared to $3.6 billion last year. long-term debt borrowings in the current year include the €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) notes issued on june 24, 2015. long-term debt payments in the current period include the purchase of $935 million aggregate principal amount of certain of the company's outstanding debentures for $1.1 billion pursuant to the cash tender offers and debt redemption while the prior period included the $1.15 billion convertible debt settled with available cash in february 2014. treasury stock purchases were $2.0 billion in the current year compared to $1.2 billion in last year.
at december 31, 2015, the company had $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.6 to 1.  included in working capital is $5.1 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  at december 31, 2015, the company's capital resources included shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion and lines of credit totaling $5.7 billion, of which $5.6 billion was unused.  the company's ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders' equity) was 24% at december 31, 2015 and 22% at december 31, 2014.  the company uses this ratio as a measure of the company's long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  the company's ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders' equity) was 20% at december 31, 2015 and 17% at december 31, 2014.  of the company's total lines of credit, $4.0 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was no commercial paper outstanding at december 31, 2015.
as of december 31, 2015, the company had $0.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.5 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. based on the company's historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its u.s. operations and unused and available u.s. credit capacity of $4.4 billion, the company has asserted that these funds are permanently reinvested outside the u.s.
the company has accounts receivable securitization programs ( the "programs") with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. the programs provide the company with up to $1.6 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the programs and expands the company's access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see note 20 in item 8 for more information and disclosures on the programs). as of december 31, 2015, the company utilized $1.2 billion of its facility under the programs.
on november 5, 2014, the company's board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the company's common stock during the period commencing january 1, 2015 and ending december 31, 2019. the company has acquired approximately 43.3 million shares under this program.
the company expects capital expenditures of $1.0 billion during 2016. in 2016, the company expects additional cash outlays of approximately $0.7 billion in dividends, $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in share repurchases, subject to strategic capital requirements, and approximately $130 million upon the completion of the previously-announced harvest innovations, medsofts group, and morocco corn plant transactions.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
the company's credit facilities and certain debentures require the company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  the company was in compliance with these covenants as of december 31, 2015.
the three major credit rating agencies have maintained the company's credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable outlooks.
on july 1, 2015, the company accepted for purchase $794 million aggregate principal amount of certain of its outstanding debentures (the "debentures") validly tendered and not withdrawn. pursuant to the terms of its previously announced cash tender offers, the company paid aggregate total consideration of $961 million for the debentures accepted for purchase. in september 2015, the company redeemed $141 million of its 5.45% outstanding debentures for $156 million. to finance the cash tender offers and debt redemption, the company issued euro-denominated debt on june 24, 2015 (see note 10 in item 8). the company recognized a debt extinguishment charge of $189 million, including transaction expenses of $7 million, in 2015 pertaining to these transactions.
on july 31, 2015, the company completed the sale of its global chocolate business to cargill, inc. for $431 million. the company recorded a gain on disposal of $38 million, net of transaction expenses, in the oilseeds processing segment in the year ended december 31, 2015.
on october 16, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of eatem foods company, a leading developer and producer of premium traditional, natural, and organic savory flavor systems, for $160 million, and closed on the sale of its global cocoa business to olam international limited for approximately $1.2 billion, subject to post-closing adjustments.
on november 2, 2015, the company completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in eaststarch c.v. for €240 million (approximately $265 million), subject to post-closing adjustments.
contractual obligations in the normal course of business, the company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the company to make payments in the future.  the following table sets forth the company's significant future obligations by time period.  purchases include commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk," energy-related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the company's normal business activities.  the following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $49 million as of december 31, 2015 as the company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement.  where applicable, information included in the company's consolidated financial statements and notes is cross-referenced in this table.

(1) includes pension contributions of $31 million for fiscal 2016.  the company is unable to estimate the amount of pension contributions beyond fiscal year 2016.  for more information concerning the company's pension and other postretirement plans, see note 15 in item 8.
at december 31, 2015, the company estimates it will spend approximately $1.5 billion through fiscal year 2020 to complete currently approved capital projects which are not included in the table above.
the company also has outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds of $0.8 billion at december 31, 2015.
the company has entered into agreements, primarily debt guarantee agreements related to equity-method investees, which could obligate the company to make future payments.  the company's liability under these agreements arises only if the primary entity fails to perform its contractual obligation.  the company has collateral for a portion of these contingent obligations.  at december 31, 2015, these contingent obligations totaled approximately $4 million.
off balance sheet arrangements accounts receivable securitization programs the company has an accounts receivable securitization program with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. in march 2014, the company entered into a second accounts receivable securitization program with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. see note 20 of item 8 for more information about these programs.
synthetic leasing program the company is a party to lease agreements under synthetic leasing programs for certain of its u.s. barge and trucking assets for periods ranging from 5 to 7 years. as of december 31, 2015, outstanding lease balances, including the value of the underlying assets of $141 million, were off-balance sheet. these agreements provide the company with the right to use these assets for specified periods in exchange for an obligation to make rental payments. the agreements are accounted for as operating leases, such that the rent expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings. the future lease payments pertaining to these lease agreements are included in the contractual obligations table in item 7. these leasing programs are utilized primarily to diversify funding sources and to retain flexibility. the company recorded $5 million, $5 million, and $3 million of rent expense pertaining to synthetic lease payments for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company's assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  these estimates and judgments are based on the company's historical experience and management's knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  certain of the company's accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the company's financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  management has discussed with the company's audit committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.  following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the company's financial statements.
fair value measurements - inventories and commodity derivatives certain of the company's inventory and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of december 31, 2015 are valued at estimated fair values, including $4.1 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $0.8 billion of derivative assets, $0.6 billion of derivative liabilities, and $0.7 billion of inventory-related payables.  commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward fixed-price purchase and sale contracts for agricultural commodities. merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.  management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  the company's inventory and derivative commodity fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $1.2 billion of assets and $0.1 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.  for more information concerning amounts reported as level 3, see note 3 in item 8.  changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.  additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.
derivatives - designated hedging activities the company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to fix the purchase price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month, to fix the purchase price of the company's anticipated natural gas requirements for certain production facilities, and to fix the sales price of anticipated volumes of ethanol.  these designated hedging programs principally relate to the company's corn processing operating segment.  assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.  if it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  see note 4 in item 8 for additional information.
investments in affiliates the company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence, including its 19.0% investment in wilmar.  these investments in affiliates are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.  however, the company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements.  if management used a different accounting method for these investments, then the amount of earnings from affiliates the company recognizes may materially differ.

income taxes the company accounts for its income tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. these standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. the company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. the company frequently faces challenges from u.s. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the company.  for example, the company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in brazil and argentina, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the company.  the company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions (see note 13 in item 8 for additional information).
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns, and the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the company's income statement.  the realization of the company's deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  the company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results. valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely. during 2015, the company decreased valuation allowances by approximately $45 million primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards and asset impairments. to the extent the company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances, the company's effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.
undistributed earnings of the company's foreign subsidiaries and the company's share of the undistributed earnings of affiliated corporate joint venture companies accounted for on the equity method amounting to approximately $9.6 billion at december 31, 2015, are considered to be permanently reinvested, and accordingly, no provision for u.s. income taxes has been provided thereon.  if the company were to receive distributions from any of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates or determine the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries or affiliates to not be permanently reinvested, the company could be subject to u.s. tax liabilities which have not been provided for in the consolidated financial statements.
property, plant, and equipment and asset abandonments and write-downs the company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  this business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.  both the availability of the company's raw materials and the demand for the company's finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  these aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the company's raw materials and finished products.  any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the company's assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its facilities.  the company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.  these new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.  management evaluates the company's property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.  during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, impairment charges for property, plant, and equipment were $108 million, $35 million, and $84 million, respectively (see note 19 in item 8 for additional information).
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (continued)
business combinations the company's acquisitions are accounted for as purchases in accordance with asc topic 805, business combinations, as amended. assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on preliminary purchase price allocations, are adjusted to fair values at acquisition date with the remainder of the purchase price, if any, recorded as goodwill. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates. although management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, actual results may differ.
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on october 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows and discount rates. definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 47 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  the company recorded an impairment charge for goodwill and intangibles of $21 million and $9 million during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2013, respectively (see note 19 in item 8 for more information). there were no impairment charges recorded for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the year ended december 31, 2014. if management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.
employee benefit plans the company provides substantially all u.s. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.  the company provides eligible u.s. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with access to postretirement health care, at full cost to the retiree (certain employees are "grandfathered" into subsidized coverage while others are provided with health care reimbursement accounts).  in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.  these estimates and assumptions are based on the company's historical experience combined with management's knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.  if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.

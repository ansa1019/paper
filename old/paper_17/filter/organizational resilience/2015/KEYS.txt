item 1a.  risk factors risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results risks related to our business depressed and uncertain general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
our business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the united states. the continued economic downturn may adversely impact our business, resulting in:
•   reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders or increases in order cancellations;
•   increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;
•   increased price pressure for our products and services; and
•   greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our future investment portfolio.
our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.
visibility into our markets is limited. our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of technology-related spending and orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. in addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. however, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. any decline in our customers' markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. the broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our business. also, if our customers' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. such declines could harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, r&d and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough, these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.
if we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.
we generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. in addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. the success of new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
•   properly identify customer needs;
•   innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;
•   successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;
•   differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings;
•   price our products competitively;
•   anticipate our competitors' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and control product quality in our manufacturing process.
dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.
as part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. if our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. for example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers' orders on a timely basis. the ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcees could cause disruptions or delays. in addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology ("it") and other administrative
functions. since it is critical to our operations, any failure of our it providers to perform could impair our ability to operate effectively. in addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or it outsourcing could result in lower revenues and unrealized efficiencies, and could impact our results of operations and stock price. much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.
failure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers' demand could adversely affect our income.
our income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. the sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. for example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. during a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. in the past, we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products. in addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. in addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. in order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancellable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for communications and electronics products has decreased. if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.
our operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.
because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. if, during a general market upturn or an upturn in our business, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner, which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. this inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our income, margin and operating results. by contrast, if, during an economic downturn, we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income, margins and operating results.
economic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.
because we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. in addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the united states. accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:
•   interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
•   changes in a specific country's or region's political, economic or other conditions;
•   trade protection measures, sanctions, and import or export licensing requirements or restrictions;
•   negative consequences from changes in tax laws;
•   differing protection of intellectual property;
•   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and
•   volatile political environments or geopolitical turmoil, including regional conflicts, terrorism, and war.
we centralize most of our accounting processes at two locations: india and malaysia. these processes include general accounting, inventory cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivables functions. if conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers. our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.
additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and u.s. laws and regulations, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our
business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. although we plan to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these policies and procedures.
in addition, although a substantial amount of our products are priced and paid for in u.s. dollars, many of our products are priced in local currencies and a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. our hedging programs are designed to reduce, but not entirely eliminate, within any given 12-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, including those caused by currency controls, which could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. however, for expenses beyond a 12-month period, our hedging strategy will not mitigate our exchange rate risk. in addition, our currency hedging programs involve third-party financial institutions as counterparties. the weakening or failure of these counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in the number of available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms or the failure of counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.
significant key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
certain significant key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. these customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions. large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities for us if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times. while we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts, we may have to agree to some or all of these types of provisions to secure these orders and to continue to grow our business. such actions expose us to significant additional risks, which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we may not be able to maintain or expand our business. the markets in which we operate are dynamic, and we may need to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures from time to time. we believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate. however, there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas in which we operate, and it may become more difficult to retain key employees.
environmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved, and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.
some of our properties are undergoing remediation by hewlett-packard company ("hp") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of agilent's separation from hp in 1999. in connection with agilent's separation from hp, hp and agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which hp agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to keysight in respect of facilities transferred to us in the separation. as a result, hp will have access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation. although hp agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at such properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. in connection with the separation, agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto. we cannot be sure that hp will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations.
in connection with the separation from agilent, agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from agilent to keysight. we cannot be sure that agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations.
our current manufacturing processes involve the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. as a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the united states, even if the sites outside the united states are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.
we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
we and our customers are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including, but not limited to, health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. these regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. if demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our business would suffer.
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the international standards organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the u.s. federal communications commission. we also must comply with work safety rules. if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
from time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case-by-case basis. any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from business operations. a claim of intellectual property infringement could cause us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement (which may not be available under acceptable terms, or at all), require us to redesign certain of our products (which would be costly and time-consuming) and/or subject us to significant damages or an injunction against the development and sale of certain products or services. in certain of our businesses, we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses, and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on terms favorable to us or at all.
third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights.
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. we rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer, which could harm our operating results.
our pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. in addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage. in preparation for the separation and distribution, we have applied for trademarks related to our new global brand name in various jurisdictions worldwide. any successful opposition to our applications in material jurisdictions could impose material costs on us or make it more difficult to protect our brand. different jurisdictions vary widely in the level of protection and priority they give to trademark and other intellectual property rights.
we may be required to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights, and we may or may not be able to detect infringement of such rights by third parties. our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights in a timely manner, or at all. in some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement due to a variety of reasons. in addition, competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues to the company. furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others, which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual property.
we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities. an adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the irs or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
we are or will be subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. these assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost sharing arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and
regulations in multiple jurisdictions. the outcomes of any tax examinations could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations post-separation may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued.
our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in our business mix or changes in the tax legislative landscape.
our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the mix of our earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because, among other things, there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. changes in tax laws, such as tax reform in the united states or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic co-operation and development's ("oecd") multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address "base erosion and profit shifting," could impact our effective tax rate.
if tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.
we benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. several jurisdictions have granted or are anticipated to grant us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future, the most significant being singapore. we do not expect incentives granted by other jurisdictions to have a material impact on our financial statements. the singapore tax incentive requires that specific conditions be satisfied, which include achieving thresholds of employment, ownership of certain assets, as well as specific types of investment activities within singapore. we believe that we will satisfy such conditions in the future.
our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. if we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or portions of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund the benefits that the tax incentives previously provided. as a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.
if we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to a catastrophic event, our operations could be significantly harmed.
our factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or manmade disasters. in particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake or other natural disasters due to their locations. for example, our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in california and our production facilities in japan are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. if any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. if such a disruption were to occur, we could breach our agreements, our reputation could be harmed and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. in addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decision with respect to risk retention. economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. if our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.
if we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, our business could be adversely affected.
we rely on several centralized information technology systems to provide products and services, maintain financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. if we experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. in addition, our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. furthermore, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to the company or our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to the company.
our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings.
we are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. the outcome of existing proceedings, lawsuits and claims may
differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation are often difficult to reliably predict. various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or permit us to make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.
our acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.
in the normal course of business, we may engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures. as a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. further, such transactions often have post-closing arrangements, including, but not limited to, post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. in addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. we may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, the successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:
•   the retention of key employees and/or customers;
•   the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas; and
•   the compatibility of our infrastructure, policies and organizations with those of the acquired company.
if we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our combined and consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.
in addition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. we are devoting significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. however, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital. all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.
we have substantial cash requirements in the united states, although most of our cash is generated outside of the united states. the failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the united states could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
although the cash generated in the united states from our operations, including any cash and non-permanently invested earnings repatriated to the united states, is expected to cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash may be required for special purposes such as the maturity of our current and future debt obligations, any dividends that may be declared, any future stock repurchase programs and any acquisitions. if we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically that we cannot fulfill through borrowings, equity offerings or other internal or external sources, the transfer of cash into the united states may incur an overall tax rate higher than our tax rates have been in the past and negatively impact after-tax earnings.
we have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.
we currently have outstanding debt as well as availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility. we may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.
our incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:
•   requiring a portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt;
•   increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•   reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry.
our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. in addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.
we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing shareholders.
we may need to seek additional financing for our general corporate purposes. for example, we may need to increase our investment in r&d activities or need funds to make acquisitions. we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our shareholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. if we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to further limitations on our operations and ability to pay dividends due to restrictive covenants.
adverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.
our cash and cash equivalents are invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition.
future investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our future plans.
we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans that cover many of our salaried and hourly employees. the federal pension protection act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of the u.s. plans, and there may be similar funding requirements in the plans outside the united states. because it is unknown what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time, no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition.
risks related to the separation our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly-traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.
the historical information about the company prior to fiscal year 2015 refers to our business as operated by and integrated with agilent. our historical financial information prior to fiscal year 2015 included in this form 10-k is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of agilent. accordingly, the historical financial information does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly-traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below:
•   prior to the separation, our business was operated by agilent as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. agilent or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us such as legal, treasury, accounting, auditing, human resources, corporate affairs and finance. our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from agilent for such functions and are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly-traded company. following the separation, we are responsible for the cost related to such functions previously performed by agilent;
•   generally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, have historically been satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of agilent. following the separation, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements; and
•   our historical financial information does not reflect the debt or the associated interest expense that we have incurred as part of the separation and distribution.
other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from agilent. for additional information about the past financial performance of our business
and the basis of presentation of the historical combined and consolidated financial statements, see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and the financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
potential indemnification liabilities to agilent pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the separation and distribution agreement provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for any liabilities associated with assets used by our business; our failure to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any such liabilities or contracts, in accordance with their respective terms, whether prior to, at or after the distribution; any guarantee, indemnification obligation, surety bond or other credit support agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding by agilent for our benefit, unless they are liabilities related to assets used in the agilent business; any breach by us of the separation agreement or any of the ancillary agreements or any action by us in contravention of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws; and any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, with respect to all information contained in the registration statement or any other disclosure document that describes the separation or the distribution or the company and its subsidiaries or primarily relates to the transactions contemplated by the separation and distribution agreement, subject to certain exceptions. if we are required to indemnify agilent under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities.
in connection with our separation from agilent, agilent will indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that agilent's ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with agilent, agilent agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. however, third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that agilent has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from agilent will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that agilent will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. in addition, agilent's insurers may attempt to deny us coverage for liabilities associated with certain occurrences of indemnified liabilities prior to the separation. moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from agilent or such insurance providers any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
we will be subject to continuing contingent liabilities of agilent following the separation.
after the separation, there are several significant areas where the liabilities of agilent may become our obligations. for example, under the internal revenue code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the agilent u.s. consolidated group during a taxable period or portion of a taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is severally liable for the u.s. federal income tax liability of the entire agilent u.s. consolidated group for that taxable period. consequently, if agilent is unable to pay the consolidated u.s. federal income tax liability for a prior period, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such tax, which could be substantial and in excess of the amount allocated to it under the tax matters agreement between us and agilent. other provisions of federal law establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.
a condition to the distribution is that agilent received an opinion of baker & mckenzie llp, tax counsel to agilent, regarding the qualification of the separation and the distribution as a reorganization within the meaning of sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(d) of the code. the opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from agilent and keysight, including those regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, agilent and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the opinion, and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion.
if the distribution were determined to be taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes, agilent and its shareholders that are subject to u.s. federal income tax could incur significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities. for example, if the distribution failed to qualify for tax-free treatment, agilent would for u.s. federal income tax purposes be treated as if it had sold the keysight common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and agilent's shareholders, who are subject to u.s. federal income tax, would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the keysight common stock received in the distribution. in addition, if the separation and distribution failed to qualify for tax-free treatment under federal,
state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, agilent (and, under the tax matters agreement described below, keysight) could incur significant tax liabilities under u.s. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law.
under the tax matters agreement between agilent and keysight, we are generally required to indemnify agilent against taxes incurred by agilent that arise as a result of our taking or failing to take, as the case may be, certain actions that result in the distribution failing to meet the requirements of a tax-free distribution under section 355 of the code. under the tax matters agreement between agilent and keysight, we may also be required to indemnify agilent for other contingent tax liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our financial position.
to preserve the tax-free treatment for u.s. federal income tax purposes to agilent of the separation and distribution, under the tax matters agreement that we have entered into with agilent, we are restricted from taking any action that prevents the separation and distribution from being tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes. under the tax matters agreement, for the two-year period following the distribution, we are prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from entering into acquisition, merger, liquidation, sale and stock redemption transactions with respect to our stock if such transactions, taken as a whole, would result in one or more persons acquiring forty percent (40%) or more of the outstanding keysight stock.
these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders or that might increase the value of our business. in addition, under the tax matters agreement, we may be required to indemnify agilent against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of keysight's stock or assets, even if we did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition.
certain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity interest in agilent.
the ownership by our executive officers and some of our directors of common shares of agilent may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest. because of their current or former positions with agilent, certain of our executive officers and directors own agilent common shares. the individual holdings of common shares may be significant for some of these persons compared to these persons' total assets. even though our board of directors consist of a majority of directors who are independent, and our executive officers ceased to be employees of agilent upon the separation, continuing ownership of agilent common shares by our executive officers and some of our directors could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if keysight and agilent pursue the same corporate opportunities or face decisions that could have different implications for keysight and agilent.
the one-time and ongoing costs of the spin-off may be greater than we expected.
we have and will continue to incur costs in connection with our transition to being a stand-alone public company that relate primarily to accounting, tax, legal and other professional costs; financing costs in connection with obtaining our financing as a stand-alone company; compensation, such as modifications to certain incentive awards as a result of spin-off; recruiting and relocation costs associated with hiring our senior management personnel; and costs to separate assets and information systems. these costs, whether incurred before or after the spin-off, may be greater than anticipated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
risks related to our common stock our share price may fluctuate significantly.
our common stock is listed on nyse under the ticker symbol "keys." the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:
•   actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;
•   success or failure of our business strategy;
•   our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;
•   announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;
•   changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;
•   the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;
•   changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;
•   the operating and share price performance of other comparable companies;
•   investor perception of our company;
•   overall market fluctuations;
•   changes in laws or regulations affecting our business; and
•   general economic conditions and other external factors.
stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
in addition, when the market price of a company's shares drops significantly, shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. a lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources.
we cannot guarantee the payment of dividends on our common stock, or the timing or amount of any such dividends.
we do not currently expect to pay dividends on our common stock. the payment of any dividends in the future, and the timing and amount thereof, to our shareholders will fall within the discretion of our board of directors. the board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, restrictive covenants in our debt, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. we cannot guarantee that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we commence paying dividends.
certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and of delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of the company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. these provisions include, among others:
•   the inability of our shareholders to call a special meeting;
•   the inability of our shareholders to act without a meeting of shareholders;
•   the right of our board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;
•   the division of our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term, and this classified board provision could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult;
•   the ability of our directors, and not shareholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors; and
•   the requirement that the affirmative vote of shareholders holding at least 80% of our voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (relating to the number, term and removal of our directors, the filling of our board vacancies, the advance notice to be given for nominations for elections of directors, the calling of special meetings of shareholders, shareholder action by written consent, the ability of the board of directors to amend the bylaws, elimination of liability of directors to the extent permitted by delaware law, exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders and amendments of the certificate of incorporation) and certain provisions in our amended and restated bylaws (relating to the calling of special meetings of shareholders, the business that may be conducted or considered at annual or special meetings, the advance notice of shareholder business and nominations, shareholder action by written consent, the number, tenure, qualifications and removal of our directors, the filling of our board vacancies, director and officer indemnification and amendments of the bylaws).
in addition, because we have not chosen to be exempt from section 203 of the delaware general corporation law (the "dgcl"), this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may favor. section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation (an "interested stockholder") shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder, unless (i) prior to such time, the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (ii) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced (excluding for purposes of
determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder) the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan); or (iii) on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder.
we believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. however, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of the company and our shareholders. these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.
in addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of section 355(e) of the code. under the tax matters agreement, we would be required to indemnify agilent for the resulting tax, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that some shareholders may consider favorable.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates that the state courts in the state of delaware or, if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the district of delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless the board of directors otherwise determines, the state courts in the state of delaware or, if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the district of delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to the company or our shareholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl or keysight's amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.

basis of presentation and separation from agilent keysight technologies, inc. ("we," "us," "keysight" or the "company"), incorporated in delaware on december 6, 2013, is a measurement company providing core electronic design and test solutions to communications and electronics industries. our fiscal year end is october 31. unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.
on november 1, 2014, keysight technologies, inc. ("we," "our," "keysight" or "the company") became an independent publicly-traded company through the distribution by agilent technologies, inc. ("agilent") of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of keysight to agilent's shareholders (the "separation"). each agilent shareholder of record as of the close of business on october 22, 2014, received one share of keysight common stock for every two shares of agilent common stock held on the record date. keysight was incorporated in delaware on december 6, 2013 and is comprised of agilent's former electronic measurement business. keysight's registration statement on form 10 was declared effective by the u.s. securities and exchange commission on october 6, 2014. keysight's common stock began trading "regular-way" under the ticker symbol "keys" on the new york stock exchange on november 3, 2014.
agilent transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of the electronic measurement business to keysight in august 2014 ("the capitalization"). combined financial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a stand-alone basis derived from agilent's consolidated financial statements and accounting records, including expenses that were allocated to us using estimates that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by us.
following the capitalization, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our subsidiaries. for the first half of fiscal year 2015, agilent provided some services on a transitional basis for a fee, which were partially offset by other operating income from keysight services provided to agilent. these services were received or provided under a transition services agreement. the net costs associated with the transition services agreement were not materially different than the historical costs that were allocated to us related to these same services.
we are incurring other incremental costs as an independent, publicly traded company as compared to the costs historically allocated to us by agilent. these incremental costs are estimated to be approximately $15 million on an annual pre-tax basis. in addition, for the years ended october 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized non-recurring separation and related costs of $20 million and $78 million, respectively. we expect to recognize additional non-recurring separation and related costs, which are currently estimated to range from $12 million to $17 million through fiscal 2016. these costs are expected to include primarily costs related to infrastructure resizing and optimization.
overview and executive summary we provide electronic measurement instruments and systems and related software, software design tools, and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment. related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. we also offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer's product lifecycle.
we plan to invest in product development to address the changing needs of the market and facilitate growth. we are investing in research and development to design measurement solutions that will satisfy the changing needs of our customers. these opportunities are being driven by the need for faster data rates and new form factors, and by evolving technology standards.
we have two reportable operating segments, measurement solutions and customer support and services. the measurement solutions segment is primarily the hardware and associated software businesses serving the electronic measurement market. the customer support and services segment provides repair and calibration of the hardware measurement solutions and the resale of used instrument equipment.
total orders in 2015 were $2,853 million, a decrease of 4 percent when compared to 2014. order declines in aerospace and defense and communications markets were partially offset by a slight increase in industrial, computer, and semiconductor market. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 4 percentage points on the year‐over‐year comparison. orders associated with acquisitions accounted for 1 percentage point of order growth for the year ended october 31, 2015 when compared to 2014. orders of $2,963 million in 2014 increased 3 percent when compared to 2013 with growth in all markets.
net revenue of $2,856 million in 2015 decreased 3 percent when compared to 2014, with communications market contributing 2 percentage points of the decrease and industrial, computer and semiconductor market contributing 1 percentage point of the decrease, while aerospace and defense market revenue was flat. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 4 percentage points on the year over year comparison. the revenue increase associated with acquisitions accounted for approximately 1 percentage point for the year ended october 31, 2015 when compared to 2014. net revenue of $2,933 million in 2014 increased 2 percent when compared to 2013, with industrial, computer and semiconductor market contributing 2 percentage points of the increase, and communications market contributing 1 percentage point of the increase, partially offset by a decline in aerospace and defense market revenue. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year over year comparison.
net income was $513 million in 2015 compared to net income of $392 million in 2014 and $457 million in 2013. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, we generated operating cash flows of $376 million, $563 million and $566 million, respectively.
looking forward, we believe the long-term growth rate of our markets is 2 to 3 percent, although current macroeconomic indicators remain mixed. we intend to leverage our unique formula of hardware plus software plus people to create value for our customers and shareholders. our focus is on delivering value through innovative electronic design and test solutions as well as improving our operational efficiency as an independent company.
we accelerated our efforts in both wireless communications and software by acquiring anite in august 2015. this acquisition expands our solutions offering in wireless communications design and test, specifically into the software layer for design and validation and provides an adjacent market opportunity in network test.
restructuring activities we initiated a targeted workforce reduction program in july 2015 that is expected to reduce keysight's total headcount by approximately 104 employees, representing approximately 1 percent of our global workforce. the timing and scope of workforce reductions will vary based on local legal requirements. this is a targeted workforce management program designed to restructure our operations and cost structure for optimization of resources and cost savings. in the current year, we recognized $8 million of expense associated with the headcount reduction under this workforce reduction program. as of october 31, 2015, approximately 70 employees have left and $5 million was paid in severance under the above actions.
we also announced a pre-retirement notification program for retirement-eligible employees to provide early notice of their planned retirement in return for severance benefits. the program is entirely voluntary and can be initiated only by an employee. approximately 160 employees of our total workforce opted for early retirement under this program as of october 31, 2015. in the current year, we recognized $8 million of expense associated with the headcount reductions and paid $6 million in severance under the pre-retirement notification program.
when completed, these programs are expected to result in operational efficiency and net annual savings of approximately $18 million, while maintaining our focus on growing the business. as of october 31, 2015, we have a remaining accrual of $6 million under these plans. we expect to complete a majority of these actions by the end of first quarter of fiscal year 2016.
acquisitions acquisition of anite. on august 13, 2015, we acquired all share capital of anite for a cash purchase price of $558 million, net of $43 million cash acquired. anite is a u.k.-based global company and a leading supplier of wireless test solutions with strong software expertise. this acquisition strengthens our wireless software design and test portfolio and its network test business expands our served addressable market. coupled with keysight's expertise in helping customers design and test hardware, we can now provide customers with more comprehensive wireless hardware and software solutions. anite's network test business will also enable us to provide innovative solutions that help customers deliver an outstanding experience for mobile users in the network. anite results are included in keysight's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and are reported in the measurement solutions segment. we financed the acquisition with available cash. for additional detail related to the acquisition of anite, see note 3, "acquisitions."
acquisition of electroservices. on august 28, 2015, we acquired all share capital of electroservices enterprises limited for a cash purchase price of $16 million, net of $1 million cash acquired. electroservices is a u.k.-based company, specializing in test equipment service and solutions. electroservices provides a broad range of electrical, mechanical and physical/dimensional calibration, repair and asset management services to defense, telecom and industrial customers. the electroservices acquisition supports our initiative to grow keysight services. electroservices results are included in keysight's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and are reported in the customer support and services segment.
investments in june 2015, we purchased $7 million of preferred stock of a privately held radio frequency microstructure company. we are accounting for this investment using the cost method. in 2015, other cost method investments with a carrying amount of $4 million were written down to their fair value of zero, resulting in an impairment charge of $4 million, which is included in other income (expense), net. there were no impairments recognized in 2014 and 2013.
currency exchange rate exposure our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. we hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short-term and anticipated basis. the result of the hedging has been included in our combined and consolidated statement of operations. we experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and combined and consolidated statement of operations because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis of up to a rolling twelve- month period. therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. to the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the u.s. dollar cost of the transaction.
orders and net revenue in general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months. revenue reflects the delivery and acceptance of the products and services as defined on the customer's terms and conditions. cancellations are recorded in the period received from the customer and historically have not been material.

net revenue the following table provides the percent change in revenue for the years ended october 31, 2015 and 2014 by geographic region, including and excluding the impact of currency changes, as compared to the respective prior year.
year over year % change
net revenue of $2,856 million in 2015 decreased 3 percent when compared to 2014. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 4 percentage points on the year-over-year compare. the revenue increase associated with acquisitions accounted for approximately 1 percentage point for the year ended october 31, 2015 when compared to 2014. revenue from the americas grew 3 percent, driven by strong aerospace and defense and industrial, computer and semiconductor markets, partially offset by a decline in the communications market. revenue from asia pacific excluding japan declined 5 percent due to weakness in communications and industrial, computer and semiconductor markets, partially offset by strength in the aerospace and defense market. europe revenue declined 8 percent with declines in aerospace and defense and communications markets, partially offset by growth in the industrial, computer and semiconductor markets. japan revenues declined 6 percent impacted by an unfavorable currency impact of 12 percentage points on the year-over-year compare. declines in the aerospace and defense market were partially offset by an increase in the communications market.
net revenue of $2,933 million for 2014 increased 2 percent as compared to 2013. foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the year-over-year compare. revenue from asia pacific excluding japan grew 8 percent, driven by growth in communications and industrial, computer and semiconductor markets. europe revenue increased 5 percent year-over-year from growth in the communications markets. revenue from the americas declined 3 percent year-over-year, with lower revenue from aerospace and defense and communications markets. japan revenues declined 9 percent year-over-year, impacted by an unfavorable currency impact of 9 percentage points. declines were primarily in the communications market.
communications market revenue, representing approximately 33 percent of total revenue for the year ended october 31, 2015, contributed 2 percentage points to the total revenue decline with decreases in wireless manufacturing partially offset by growth in broadband communications and wireless r&d. the decrease in wireless manufacturing reflects the difficult compares to last year's strength in 4g base station and infrastructure manufacturing for china. weakness in the smartphone/device manufacturing segment continued. wireless r&d grew year-over-year with lte and lte-advanced technology development continuing to drive investment. in 2014, communications market revenue, representing approximately 34 percent of total revenue, contributed 1 percentage point to the total revenue increase as compared to 2013 with increases in wireless manufacturing and the broadband communications business, partially offset by modest declines in wireless r&d.
aerospace and defense market revenue, representing approximately 23 percent of total revenue for the year ended october 31, 2015, increased 1 percent year-over-year with growth in americas and asia pacific excluding japan, partially offset by declines in europe and japan. in 2014, aerospace and defense market revenue, representing approximately 22 percent of total revenue, contributed a 1 percentage point decline in total revenue as compared to 2013, with declines in all regions, however we saw positive growth in the last half of fiscal 2014.
industrial, computer and semiconductor market revenue, representing approximately 44 percent of total revenue for the year ended october 31, 2015, contributed 1 percentage point to the total revenue decline as compared to 2014. declines in japan and asia pacific excluding japan were partially offset by growth in the americas and europe. in 2014, industrial, computer and semiconductor market revenue, representing approximately 44 percent of the total revenue, contributed 2 percentage points to the year-over-year increase compared to 2013. the computer and semiconductor increase was driven by investment in capacity growth and the overall strength in the semiconductor market. the industrial test business grew for the year with particular strength in the last fiscal quarter driven by growth in the americas and asia pacific, excluding japan.
backlog backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers.
at october 31, 2015, our unfilled backlog was approximately $779 million as compared to approximately $781 million at october 31, 2014. for the measurement solutions business, our backlog was approximately $653 million at october 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $627 million at october 31, 2014. within our customer services and support business, our backlog was approximately $126 million at october 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $154 million at october 31, 2014. the reduction in the customer services and support business backlog in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a change in our standard warranty term, which increased from one to three years for most of our products in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.  revenue associated with extended warranties, which provide coverage beyond the standard warranty term, is deferred and amortized over the extended period of coverage.  as a result of the extension of the standard warranty term, backlog associated with extended warranties has declined. three-year warranty is now included as part of the total solution, and the value is captured as part of the initial sales price.
we expect that a majority of the backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months. on average, our backlog represents approximately three months' of revenue. we believe backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.

gross margin remained flat in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower depreciation, warranty and inventory charges, offset by lower volume. gross margin declined 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 on slightly higher revenue. higher inventory charges and pricing pressure in the wireless manufacturing market were the primary reasons for the lower gross margin.
excess and obsolete inventory charges were $28 million in 2015, $33 million in 2014 and $21 million in 2013. sales of previously written-down inventory were $2 million in 2015 and $1 million in 2014 and 2013.
research and development expense increased 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. the increased expenditure was due to our continued investment in research and development programs and increased costs due to the acquisitions, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency movements. as a percentage of total revenue, research and development expenses increased 2 percentage points to 14 percent in 2015 from 12 percent in 2014. we expect investment in research and development to continue at current levels and have focused our development efforts on strategic growth opportunities. research and development expenses declined 4 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower infrastructure-related expenses. reductions in development spending, variable and incentive pay, and infrastructure-related expenses, and the favorable impact of currency movements were partially offset by investments in acquisitions and wage increases.
selling, general and administrative expenses were flat in 2015 when compared to 2014, primarily driven by lower separation costs and favorable impact of currency movements, offset by increases in share-based compensation, restructuring programs and increased costs due to acquisitions, primarily anite. selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to higher costs related to non-recurring pre-separation transaction costs and an increase in marketing expenses, partially offset by reductions in infrastructure costs and the favorable impact of currency movements.
other operating expense (income), net for 2015 was $(18) million, which includes primarily rental income.
operating margins declined 1 percentage point in 2015 compared to 2014 on lower revenue volume and increases in research and development expenses, restructuring programs, acquisition and integration related expenses, offset by decline in separation costs and the favorable impact of foreign currency. operating margins declined 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 driven primarily by one-time separation costs.
as of october 31, 2015, our headcount was approximately 10,250 compared to 9,600 in 2014 primarily as a result of the acquisition of anite.
provision (benefit) for income taxes   $(125     )         $83                 $44
for 2015, the effective tax rate was a benefit of 32 percent, which is lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the retroactive benefit of two tax incentives in singapore approved during 2015. also, the tax rate was lower than the u.s. statutory rate due to the mix of earnings in the non-u.s. jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates.
for 2014, the effective tax rate was 18 percent. the 18 percent effective tax is lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in non-u.s. jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates in particular singapore, where we benefited from tax incentives for the first three quarters of 2014, which resulted in $40 million lower income tax expense. the 2014 rate was also favorably impacted by a $55 million benefit from a prior year reserve release, which was offset by $62 million of tax expense as a result of the repatriation of foreign earnings.
for 2013, the effective tax rate was 9 percent. the 9 percent effective tax is lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in non-u.s. jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory tax rates in particular singapore, where we benefited from tax incentives.
we benefit from tax incentives in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in singapore, and several jurisdictions have granted or are anticipated to grant us tax incentives that require renewal at various times in the future. the tax incentives provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. the tax incentives are due for renewal between 2016 and 2023. the impact of the tax incentives decreased income taxes by $250 million, $40 million and $68 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the combined and consolidated statements of operations.
for the majority of our entities, the open tax years for the irs, state and most foreign audit authorities are from august 1, 2014, through the current tax year. for certain historical agilent foreign entities that keysight retained as part of the separation, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2005. for certain entities acquired during 2015, the tax years also remain open back to the year 2005. given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.
for fiscal 2014 and prior, we have calculated our taxes on a separate return basis. however, the amounts recorded for fiscal 2014 and prior are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had we been an entity that operated independently of agilent. consequently, our results after our separation from agilent may be materially different from our historical results.
segment overview we have two reportable operating segments, measurement solutions and customer support and services. the measurement solutions segment is primarily the hardware and associated software businesses serving the electronic measurement market. the customer support and services segment provides hardware repair and calibration and the resale of used instrument equipment.
the profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, investment gains and losses, interest income, interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, separation and related costs, acquisition-related fair value adjustments and non-cash amortization. in 2015, we began excluding share-based compensation expense in addition to the items noted above to derive segment profitability. prior year numbers have been revised to reflect the change.
measurement solutions business our measurement solutions business provides electronic measurement instruments and systems with related software and software design tools that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment. we provide start-up assistance, consulting, optimization and application support throughout our customer's product lifecycle. our electronic design and test solutions serve the following markets: communications, aerospace and defense, and industrial, computer and semiconductor.

gross margin in 2015 increased 2 percentage points when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower depreciation, warranty and inventory charges. gross margin in 2014 decreased 1 percentage point when compared to 2013 primarily due to higher inventory charges and pricing pressure in the wireless manufacturing market.
research and development expenses increased 7 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. increased expenditures were due to our continued investment in research and development programs and increased costs due to the anite acquisition, partially offset by the favorable impact of currency movements. research and development expenses decreased 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013 driven primarily by lower infrastructure costs. we expect investment in research and development to continue at current levels and have focused our development efforts on strategic growth opportunities.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, driven primarily by the increased costs related to the anite acquisition, higher infrastructure-related costs and advertising and marketing expenses, which are partially offset by lower people-related costs and favorable currency movements. selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. decreases in infrastructure costs were partially offset by increases in marketing and discretionary spending.
operating margin remained flat in 2015 compared to 2014 as higher gross margin was offset by increases in operating expenses, primarily due to increased costs related to the anite acquisition and investments in r&d programs. operating margin increased by 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013 on higher revenue and lower operating expenses.
income from operations income from operations in 2015 decreased by $21 million, or 4 percent, on revenue decline of $72 million. income from operations in 2014 increased by $24 million, or 5 percent, on a revenue increase of $40 million.
customer support and services business our customer support and services business provides hardware repair and calibration services and facilitates the resale of used equipment. our customer support and services business enables our customers to maximize the value from their electronic measurement equipment and strengthens customer loyalty. providing these services assures a high level of instrument performance and availability, while minimizing the cost of ownership and downtime.

gross margins in 2015 decreased 3 percentage points compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in people related costs, higher infrastructure-related costs and an unfavorable service mix. gross margins in 2014 decreased 2 percentage points compared to 2013. increased costs for extended warranty contracts and the service mix change with increased calibrations were the primary reasons for the lower gross margin.
research and development expenses for customer support and services represent the segment's share of centralized investment. research and development expenses were flat in both 2015 and 2014 as compared to respective prior year.
operating margins decreased by 5 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by flat revenues, higher infrastructure-related costs and field selling costs. operating margins decreased by 2 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013. revenue growth was more than offset by the reductions in gross margins.
income from operations income from operations in 2015 decreased by $21 million, or 22 percent on a revenue increase of $1 million. income from operations in 2014 increased by $6 million or 6 percent on a revenue increase of $5 million.
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our financial position as of october 31, 2015 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $483 million as compared to $810 million as of october 31, 2014.
as of october 31, 2015, approximately $338 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside of the u.s. in our foreign subsidiaries. much of the non-u.s. cash will be needed for non-u.s. growth and expansion. however, some non-u.s. cash could be repatriated to the u.s. under current law, such repatriation would be subject to u.s. federal and state income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. we continue to be in discussions with agilent regarding the allocation of certain deferred tax liability balances related to foreign unremitted earnings in accordance with the separation agreements. excess foreign tax credits associated with unremitted earnings are not recorded as an asset as they do not represent a separate deferred asset until earnings are remitted. we utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. all significant international locations have access to internal funding through an offshore cashpool for working capital needs, in addition to temporary local overdraft and short-term working capital lines of credit.
on august 13, 2015, we acquired all share capital of anite for a cash price of approximately $558 million, net of $43 million of cash acquired. as a result of the acquisition, anite has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of keysight. keysight funded the acquisition using existing cash. the acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance and the results of anite are included in keysight's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
we believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $376 million in 2015 as compared to $563 million provided in 2014 and $566 million provided in 2013. as compared to 2014, the $187 million decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to cash flows associated with separation from agilent and becoming an independent company, including payments to agilent of $28 million in 2015 as compared to payments from agilent of $23 million in 2014, interest payments of $46 million in 2015 as compared to zero in 2014, pension contributions of $48 million as compared to zero in 2014 and income tax payments of $40 million in 2015 as compared to $4 million in 2014.
key working capital accounts (accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory) had net cash outflows of $27 million in 2015, $24 million in 2014 and $33 million in 2013.
we did not contribute to our u.s. defined benefit plans in 2015. agilent contributed $15 million on our behalf to the u.s. multi-employer plans on our behalf in each of 2014 and 2013. we contributed $48 million to the non-u.s. defined benefit plans in 2015 and agilent contributed $41 million and $45 million on our behalf to the non-u.s. multi-employer plans in 2014 and 2013, respectively. there were no contributions to the u.s. post-retirement benefit plan or the u.s. multi-employer post-retirement health care plan in 2015, 2014 and 2013. at the capitalization, the assets and liabilities of the multi-employer plans that were allocable to keysight employees were transferred to keysight plans; therefore, the plans were no longer considered multi-employer plans.
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in 2015 was $671 million as compared to cash used of $82 million in 2014 and $85 million in 2013. purchases of property, plant and equipment were $92 million in 2015, $70 million in 2014 and $69 million in 2013. cash used for acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, net of cash acquired, was $574 million in 2015, $11 million in 2014 and $1 million in 2013. in 2015, we invested $7 million in preferred stock of a privately held radio frequency microstructure company. we are accounting for this investment using the cost method. we purchased investments of $15 million in 2013 as compared to zero in 2014. proceeds from the sale of investment securities were $1 million in 2015 and zero in each of the fiscal years 2014 and 2013.
net cash provided by/used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities in 2015 was $19 million compared to $335 million provided in 2014 and $481 million used in 2013. financing activities in the twelve months ended october 31, 2015 reflects $26 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock option plans and $49 million of cash returned to agilent in accordance with the separation and distribution agreement. we issued senior notes of $1.1 billion and made a repayment of capital of $940 million to agilent in the year ended october 31, 2014.
credit facility on september 15, 2014, we entered into a five-year credit agreement, which provides for a $300 million unsecured credit facility that will expire on november 1, 2019. on july 21, 2015, we entered into an accession agreement, increasing the credit facility from $300 million to $450 million. the company may use amounts borrowed under the facility for general corporate purposes. as of october 31, 2015, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the facility. we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility during the year ended october 31, 2015.
as a result of the anite acquisition, we have an overdraft facility of $39 million (£25 million) that will expire on july 31, 2016. as of october 31, 2015, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the facility.  we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility from the date of acquisition to october 31, 2015.
short-term debt on july 10, 2014, our wholly owned subsidiary in india entered into a short-term loan agreement with a financial institution, which provided up to $50 million of unsecured borrowings. on july 25, 2014, we borrowed $35 million against the loan agreement at an interest rate of 9.95 percent per annum. the loan was repaid in fiscal 2014 and as of october 31, 2014, no balance was outstanding.
long-term debt in october 2014, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes ("2019 senior notes"). the 2019 senior notes were issued at 99.902% of their principal amount. the notes will mature on october 30, 2019, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.30% per annum. the interest is payable semi-annually on april 30 and october 30 of each year.
in october 2014, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes ("2024 senior notes"). the 2024 senior notes were issued at 99.966% of their principal amount. the notes will mature on october 30, 2024, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.55% per annum. the interest is payable semi-annually on april 30 and october 30 of each year.
off balance sheet arrangements and other we have contractual commitments for non-cancellable operating leases. see note 18, "commitments and contingencies," to our combined and consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancellable operating leases.
our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. as a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.
the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october 31, 2015 (in millions). the amounts presented in the table do not reflect $21 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of october 31, 2015. we are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. however, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement.

interest on senior notes.    we have contractual obligations for interest payments on our senior notes. interest rates and payment dates are detailed above under "long-term debt."
operating leases.    commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property, see note 18, "commitments and contingencies."
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers.    we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us with the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on business needs prior to firm orders being placed. purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are typically non-cancellable. approximately 88 percent
of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancellable, and unconditional commitments. we expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.
in addition to the commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers referenced above, we record a liability for firm, non-cancellable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. as of october 31, 2015, the liability for our excess firm, non-cancellable and unconditional purchase commitments was $8 million, compared to $5 million as of october 31, 2014 and 2013. these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our combined and consolidated balance sheet.
retirement plans.    commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our non-u.s. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. contributions beyond the next year are impractical to estimate.
we also have benefit payments due under our defined benefit retirement plans and post-retirement benefit plan that are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid in the same period that benefits are provided. see item 8-financial statements and supplementary data, note 16, "retirement plans and post-retirement pension plan," for additional information.
other purchase commitments. other purchase commitments relate to contracts with professional services suppliers. we can typically cancel these contracts within 90 days without penalties. for those contracts that are not cancellable within 90 days without penalties, we are disclosing the amounts we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contract in that period before such contract can be canceled. as of october 31, 2015, our contractual obligations with these suppliers was approximately $51 million within the next fiscal year, as compared to approximately $33 million as of october 31, 2014.
we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of october 31, 2015 or october 31, 2014.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, allocation methods and allocated expenses from agilent, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, restructuring and accounting for income taxes.
revenue recognition.    we enter into agreements to sell products (hardware and/or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple-element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, for products, or when the service has been provided. revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. for sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. for products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. we allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. the selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence ("vsoe") if available, third-party evidence ("tpe") if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price ("esp") if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules. revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements.
we use vsoe of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists. vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately.
tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors, it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe. esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. we determine esp for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including, but not limited to customer type, geography, market conditions, competitive landscape, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by management. we may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future. as these pricing strategies evolve, changes may occur in esp. the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple-element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.
inventory valuation.    we assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.
allocations. prior to the capitalization, agilent allocated certain costs such as share-based compensation expense and retirement and post-retirement benefit plan expense relating to our employees and agilent's corporate and shared services employees. these expenses were subject to certain underlying assumptions mentioned below.
share-based compensation.    we account for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors. the fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model. shares granted under the ltp program were valued using a monte carlo simulation model. both the black-scholes and monte carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. the estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of keysight's common stock on the date of grant. prior to the separation, it was determined based on the market price of agilent's common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for expected dividend yield. we used the average historical volatility of eleven peer companies to estimate the volatility for our stock option awards. we considered our ability to find traded options of peer companies in the current market with similar terms and prices to our options. for the year ended october 31, 2014 and 2013, we used the historical volatility of agilent stock to estimate the volatility for stock option awards. in estimating the expected life of our options, we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executives, which we believe is representative of future behavior. a 10 percent increase in our estimated volatility from 31 percent to 41 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 26 percent if no other factors were changed.
retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.  prior to the capitalization, our combined and consolidated statements of operations include expense that was allocated to us based on keysight employees participating in these plans and our share of agilent's corporate and shared services employee costs. we consider the expense allocation methodology and results to be reasonable for all periods presented. at the capitalization, we established defined benefit retirement and post-retirement plans for our current and former employees. the defined benefit retirement and post-retirement obligations relating to those participants in these plans were transferred from agilent's plans to our defined benefit plans. a proportionate share of the defined benefit plan assets was allocated from the agilent pension trust in each applicable country to a newly established keysight pension trust. the share of assets allocated to us was in the same proportion as the projected benefit obligation of our participants to the total projected benefit obligation of agilent.
retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to keysight based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and investment portfolio composition. we evaluate these assumptions at least annually.
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date, which is october 31 for both u.s. and non-u.s. plans. the u.s. discount rates at october 31, 2015 and 2014 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. the non-u.s. discount rates at october 31, 2015 were determined using spot rates along the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates. in addition, we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost: service cost and interest cost. the non-u.s. discount rates at october 31, 2014 were generally based on published rates for high-quality corporate bonds. if we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be $4 million on u.s. net periodic benefit cost and $13 million on non-u.s. net periodic benefit cost. lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense.
the company uses alternate methods of amortization, as allowed by the authoritative guidance, that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. for u.s. plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime. for most non-u.s. plans and u.s. post-retirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. the expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. plan assets are valued at fair value. if we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $6 million on u.s. net periodic benefit cost and $13 million on non-u.s. net periodic benefit cost.
goodwill and other intangible assets. we review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. as defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. we aggregated components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. at the time of an acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
companies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing the two-step quantitative test is necessary. if an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. > 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. otherwise, no further testing will be required.
the guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. these examples include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. the qualitative indicators replace those previously used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required. if it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. in the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. the second step, if necessary, measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.
historically we conducted our business in a single operating segment and reporting unit. in fiscal 2014, in conjunction with the planned separation, we implemented changes in our organizational structure which resulted in the formation of two reportable operating segments. in fiscal year 2015, we assessed goodwill impairment for our two reporting units which consisted of our two segments, measurement solutions and customer support and services. we performed a qualitative test of goodwill impairment for both reporting units as of september 30, 2015. based on the results of our testing, it was determined that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting units are greater than their carrying amounts. there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended october 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated.
other intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks and customer relationships and are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 6 months to 15 years. no impairments of purchased intangible assets were recorded during the years ended october 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
we review other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. the authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. it allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. the qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. > 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. an organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any
period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. our indefinite-lived intangible assets are ipr&d intangible assets. due to specific cancellation of an ipr&d project, we recorded an impairment of $1 million in 2013. there were no impairments in fiscal years 2015 and 2014. in all other instances we used the qualitative test and concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that all other indefinite-lived assets were not impaired.
warranty.    our standard warranty term for most of our products from the date of delivery is typically three years, which increased from one year in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. we accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percentage of net product revenue. the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time related product revenue is recognized.
restructuring.  the main component of our restructuring plan is related to workforce reductions. workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated. if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded.
accounting for income taxes.    we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. when it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. we consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. we consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. at october 31, 2015, the company maintains a valuation allowance mainly related to deferred tax assets for acquired capital losses in the u.k. we intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.
we have provided for all u.s. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries for the portion of earnings we do not intend to reinvest permanently. for the amount of foreign earnings that we consider reinvested permanently, should we decide to remit this income to the u.s. in a future period, our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. in accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all u.s. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. we include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in the combined and consolidated statements of operations.
for fiscal 2014 and prior, we have calculated our taxes on a separate return basis. however, the amounts recorded for fiscal 2014 and prior are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had we been an entity that operated independent of agilent. consequently, our results after our separation from agilent may be materially different from our historical results.

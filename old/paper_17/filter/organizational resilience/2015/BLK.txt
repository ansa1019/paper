item 1a. risk factors as a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of blackrock's business. global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, fiduciary and investment risks, blackrock's business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the company's stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.
market and competition risks changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real estate, commodities, currency or other asset markets may cause assets under management ("aum"), revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real estate, commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests, could cause:
•   the value of aum, or the returns blackrock realizes on aum, to decrease;
•   the withdrawal of funds from blackrock's products in favor of products offered by competitors;
•   the rebalancing or reallocating of assets into blackrock products that yield lower fees;
•   an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•   a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.
the occurrence of any of these events may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its investment advisory business. the advisory or management contracts blackrock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of blackrock's investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of private investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove blackrock as a fund's investment advisor (or equivalent). blackrock also manages its u.s. mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds' respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the company. blackrock's fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be subject to reduction (including at the behest of a fund's board of directors). in addition, if a number of blackrock's clients terminate their contracts, remove blackrock from advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest blackrock earns could be reduced which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
the investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. blackrock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
failure to maintain aladdin's competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock's productivity and growth.
the sophisticated risk analytics that blackrock provides via the aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients are an important element of blackrock's competitive success.  aladdin's competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine sophisticated risk analytics with comprehensive portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform.  increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken aladdin's competitive position and may cause the company's revenue and earnings to decline.  in addition, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in aladdin.
the impairment or failure of other financial institutions may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages to many different industries and counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. transactions with counterparties expose the products and accounts blackrock manages to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. although blackrock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations. any such impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts managed by blackrock, which could lead to the loss of clients and may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause aum in similar blackrock products to decline irrespective of blackrock's performance.
many competitors offer similar products to those offered by blackrock and the failure or negative performance of competitors' products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar blackrock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
changes in the value of seed and co-investments that blackrock owns could affect its nonoperating income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.
at december 31, 2015, blackrock's net economic investment exposure of approximately $1.5 billion in its investments (see "item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-investments") primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real estate, commodities or alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments, increase the volatility of blackrock's earnings and may cause earnings to decline.
acts of terror and the continued threat of terrorism, as well as increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility, both within the united states and abroad, as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, loss of life, property damage, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. acts of terror may also result in increased border security between countries which could adversely affect trade, impede growth and exacerbate refugee crises arising out of civil or international conflicts. continued geopolitical unrest and terrorist activity that adversely affect the global economy or capital markets may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
risks related to investment performance poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
the company's management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum. poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:
•   client withdrawals in favor of better performing products;
•   the company earning reduced, minimal or no performance fees;
•   an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•   a decrease in investment returns on seed and co-investment capital.
performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.
a portion of blackrock's revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. performance fees represented $621 million, or 5%, of total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015. generally, the company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement pursuant to which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. if these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the company may not earn performance fees in future periods, which may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
failure to identify errors in the quantitative models blackrock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships.
blackrock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on blackrock's business and reputation.
technology and operational risks a failure in blackrock's operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could disrupt operations, damage the company's reputation and may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. moreover a significant portion of blackrock's critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including san francisco, new york, london and gurgaon. the failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of blackrock's business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside blackrock's control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic or other catastrophic event in any location at which blackrock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth. notwithstanding blackrock's efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the company's ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the company's ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.
a cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. an externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus, phishing scam or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information.
there have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. blackrock has been the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand to create fraudulent websites, and must continuously monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt blackrock's operations and cause financial losses. in addition, due to blackrock's interconnectivity with third-party vendors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, blackrock may be adversely affected if any of them are subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event. any information security incident or cyber-attack against blackrock or third parties with whom it is connected could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect aladdin operations and could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock's productivity and growth blackrock relies on its ability to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the aladdin platform. the analytical capabilities of aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into aladdin analytical calculations.  the failure of these third parties to provide such data or information, or disruption of such information flows, could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact blackrock's ability to provide services to its investment advisory and blackrock solutions clients.
operating risks associated with blackrock's securities lending program may result in client losses.
blackrock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. in these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. blackrock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. the failure of blackrock's controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the company's clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments), and blackrock may be held liable for any failure to manage any such risks.
blackrock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.
blackrock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. in the event of a borrower default, blackrock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client's account. borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower's default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. blackrock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities blackrock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. the amount of securities on loan as of december 31, 2015 and subject to indemnification was $169.3 billion. blackrock held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $179.6 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31, 2015. significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through capital or other credit support. such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. losses on such support, as well as regulatory restrictions on the company's ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products, may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause blackrock's aum, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.
blackrock's ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its ability to maintain and grow aum, its creditworthiness and operating cash flows. failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force blackrock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. blackrock's access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.
fraud, or the circumvention of controls and risk management policies, could have an adverse effect on blackrock's reputation, which may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
although blackrock has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks, it cannot assure that such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to its businesses. blackrock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with the company's controls, policies and procedures. persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on blackrock's reputation, which could cause costly regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions and may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose blackrock to additional costs or operational risk.
blackrock's financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services. the development and introduction of new products and services require continued innovative efforts on the part of blackrock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. a failure to continue to innovate to introduce new products and services or to successfully manage the risks associated with such products and services may cause blackrock's costs to fluctuate, which may cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
the failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the company's ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within blackrock. the market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect blackrock's ability to attract and retain such employees include the company's reputation, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals. blackrock's ability to attract and retain talent may also be affected if european regulations instituting bonus caps or limiting the amount of compensation that asset managers can pay to certain employees are enacted in the varying formats in which they have been proposed.
in addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that blackrock pays to its employees is tied to the company's share price. as such, if blackrock's share price were to decrease materially, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. if blackrock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the company's ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.
future inorganic transactions may harm the company's competitive or financial position if they are not successful.
blackrock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, and acquiring investment management businesses and other small and medium-sized companies. inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities. any failure to identify and mitigate these risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact blackrock's reputation, may cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline, and may harm the company's competitive position in the investment management industry. moreover, there can be no assurances that blackrock will be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from future inorganic transactions.
investments in real assets such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets may expose blackrock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.
investments in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose blackrock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. these may include:
•   construction risks, including labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;
•   accidents, adverse weather, force majeure or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond blackrock's control;
•   failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;
•   exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;
•   environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;
•   changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;
•   the financial resources of tenants; and
•   contingent liabilities on disposition of assets.
the above risks may expose blackrock's funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by blackrock's clients.  these risks could also result in direct liability for blackrock by exposing blackrock to regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which blackrock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of blackrock's clients. the occurrence of any such events may expose blackrock to reputational harm, divert management's time and attention away from blackrock's business activities or cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
operating in international markets increases blackrock's operational, political, regulatory and other risks.
as a result of blackrock's extensive international operations, the company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the company's control. the failure of the company's systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
risks related to key third-party relationships the failure of a key vendor to blackrock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on blackrock's reputation or business, which may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, risk analytics, market data, market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. blackrock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations; however, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, feasible alternative vendors available to blackrock in certain areas. the failure or inability of blackrock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could lead to operational and regulatory issues for the company, including with respect to certain of its products, which could result in reputational harm and may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. in particular, blackrock entered into a global distribution agreement with bank of america/merrill lynch in 2006, which is subject to renegotiation at the end of 2016. blackrock's ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors is material to the company's future performance. if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully, if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings may decline.
disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to blackrock's exchange traded fund ("etf") platform may adversely affect the prices at which etfs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.
blackrock is the largest provider of etfs globally. shares of etfs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the etf's most recent net asset value ("nav"). the nav of an etf is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the etf's holdings. the trading price of the etf's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. while an etf's creation/redemption feature and the arbitrage mechanism are designed to make it more likely that the etf's shares normally will trade at prices close to the etf's nav, exchange prices may deviate significantly from the etf's nav. etf market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, inability or unwillingness of market markers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an etf's arbitrage mechanism to function effectively, or significant market volatility. although blackrock and other large issuers of etfs are working with market participants to enhance u.s. equity market resiliency, there can be no assurance that structural reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion, or at all. moreover, if market events lead to incidences where etfs trade at prices that deviate significantly from an etf's nav, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in etf products and redeem their holdings, which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
legal and regulatory risks blackrock is subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.
blackrock's business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. these regulations subject blackrock's business activities to a pervasive array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly, time-consuming and complex. blackrock may be adversely affected by its failure to comply with current laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. in particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on blackrock's reputation or business and may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline. for a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which blackrock is subject, see "item 1 - business - regulation."
in recent years a number of proposals for regulatory reform have been introduced, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which blackrock is subject is expected to increase. see "item 1 - business - regulation." a number of regulatory reforms that have been proposed may require blackrock to alter its business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly and which may impede the company's growth and may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline. regulatory reform may also impact blackrock's banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to blackrock. key regulatory reforms that may impact the company include:
•   designation as a systemically important financial institution: both the fsb, working with iosco, and fsoc are considering potential systemic risk related to asset management. in july 2014, the fsoc issued a statement indicating that their review would focus on products and activities, and fsoc subsequently released a request for information addressing: market liquidity and fund redemption risk, the use of leverage, operational risk, and the resolution of asset managers including the transition of client assets. in june 2015, iosco issued a statement indicating they also favored a products and activities approach in their review of asset managers, and in july 2015, the fsb made a similar announcement. in september 2015, the fsb released a statement indicating that their review would focus on: market liquidity and fund redemption risk, the use of leverage, securities lending practices, operational risk, and risks from pension funds and sovereign wealth funds. although fsoc, iosco and fsb have shifted from a focus on designating firms and/or funds as systemically important (i.e., g-sifi or sifi designations), the process is ongoing and may lead to designations in the future. in the event that blackrock receives a sifi designation, under the dfa, the federal reserve system is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions and blackrock could become subject to its direct supervision. if blackrock were designated a sifi or g-sifi, it could become subject to enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements, concentration limits, a contingent capital requirement, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and overall risk management requirements. requirements such as these, which were designed to regulate banking institutions, would be extremely burdensome for blackrock, unless they were modified to be applicable to an asset manager. no proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers, if at all.
•   the volcker rule: provisions of the dfa referred to as the "volcker rule" created a new section of the bhc act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively "covered funds"). conformance with the volcker rule's requirements may reduce the level of market making and liquidity activities of several of blackrock's trading counterparties, which may adversely impact the liquidity and, in some cases, the pricing of various financial instruments in which blackrock client accounts invest. because the federal reserve currently treats blackrock as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc, blackrock may be required to conform its activities to the requirements of the volcker rule. on december 18, 2014, the federal reserve announced a second extension to the volcker rule conformance period, giving banking entities until july 21, 2016, to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to december 31, 2013 ("legacy covered funds"). the federal reserve also announced its intention to grant banking entities an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until july 21, 2017, to conform ownership interests in and relationships with these legacy covered funds. blackrock has chosen to commence a conformance program for covered funds, including legacy covered funds. the volcker rule's restrictions may, among other things, limit blackrock's ability to invest in covered funds and require blackrock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds. the volcker rule may also require blackrock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in covered funds, which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value, depending on market conditions.
•   money market mutual fund reform: approximately 3% of blackrock's aum as of december 31, 2015, consisted of assets in u.s. mmfs, of which institutional prime or institutional municipal mmfs (including offshore funds that feed into such mmfs) comprised approximately 2%. in july 2014, the sec adopted new rules designed to reform the regulatory structure governing mmfs and to address the perceived systemic risks that such funds present. the new rules, to which u.s. mmfs must conform by october 2016, require institutional prime and institutional municipal mmfs to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. retail mmfs may continue operating with a constant net asset value per share. the rules also provide for new tools for institutional and retail mmfs' boards designed to address market shocks, including liquidity fees and redemption gates. the new rules do not apply to government (non-municipal) mmfs, although such funds may "opt-in" to the new liquidity fee and redemption gate provisions if previously disclosed to investors. implementation of these new rules requires the development of new or additional systems by blackrock and the funds' service providers. blackrock has commenced efforts to move its mmfs into compliance in advance of the deadline. the impact of the rules that affect the structure of the funds on blackrock's business remains uncertain as clients must decide which products fit their investment needs. the new rules will, however, affect certain of blackrock's funds' investment strategies, portfolio liquidity and return potential. the new rules will also result in changes to blackrock's existing u.s. mmfs and may reduce the attractiveness of certain u.s. mmfs to investors.
•   regulation of swaps and derivatives: the implementation of dfa regulations, similar regulations in the eu and other global jurisdictions relating to swaps and derivatives could impact the manner in which blackrock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, increasing the costs of derivatives trading for blackrock's clients. various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require blackrock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. these rules will also introduce new central clearing requirements for certain swap transactions and will require that certain swaps be executed only on or through electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), with which blackrock will have to comply. in the united states, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are already subject to the dfa central clearing and electronic trading venue requirements, with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in 2016 and beyond. for swaps and security-based swaps that are not centrally cleared, u.s. bank regulators recently adopted rules that could require blackrock-advised funds and accounts to post margin payments when trading with a swap dealer that is regulated by one of the u.s. bank regulators. the cftc also recently adopted similar margin rules applicable when trading non-cleared swaps with swap dealers who are not regulated by one of the u.s. bank regulators. these rules have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for blackrock's clients. in emea, central clearing requirements will be implemented
in a phased manner and will apply to blackrock funds and accounts beginning in the latter half of 2016. the new rules and regulations may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase blackrock's operational and legal risks.
•   sec asset management industry initiatives: the sec and its staff continue to engage in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. during 2015, the sec proposed, among other things: enhanced reporting by investment advisors, enhanced reporting on registered mutual funds, new rules for liquidity risk management in registered funds, and new rules governing the use of derivatives and leverage by registered investment companies and business development companies. furthermore, in june 2015, the sec issued a request for comments regarding practices related to etfs, which is widely expected to result in a future rulemaking. the sec has also indicated an intention to propose new rules for the stress testing of registered investment companies and transition planning by asset managers, including the transfer of client assets. the sec's focus has also been directed toward risk identification and controls in various areas, including the use of derivatives and other trading practices (as reflected in the sec's late december 2015 rule proposal referenced in "item 1 - business - regulation - regulation of swaps and derivatives" above), cyber-security and the evaluation of systemic risks. while these proposals have yet to be finalized into new rules, any new rules, guidance or regulatory initiatives resulting from these efforts could require blackrock to alter its business or operating activities or fund management practices, or increase its public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be time-consuming and costly and which may impede blackrock's growth and may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
•   revised dol fiduciary rule: in april 2015, the dol proposed a new regulation defining the term "fiduciary" for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of title i of erisa and the prohibited transaction exercise tax provisions of the irs. the rule has been highly criticized by industry participants, particularly retail intermediaries, and blackrock is engaging with the dol, trade associations and industry participants in an effort to affect revisions to the proposed rule. to the extent the rule is enacted as written, it will require blackrock to re-paper a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for blackrock's distribution partners and may limit blackrock's ability to provide certain useful services and education to its clients.
•   increased international regulatory scrutiny: in addition to the extensive scrutiny blackrock faces from u.s.-based regulators, the company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies globally, in particular in europe and the asia-pacific region. these regulators have imposed numerous regulations, guidelines and standards on the activities of blackrock and its subsidiaries covering a variety of areas, including capital resources requirements, marketing activities, client and investor protections, senior management arrangements, and system and control requirements. in the event that blackrock or any of its subsidiaries fails to comply with these often complex guidelines, regulations and standards, the regulators have broad powers to suspend or revoke any licenses they may have granted and/or to impose fines and/or sanctions.
•   european union directives: in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the european commission ("ec") initiated a plan for eu financial reform, including a number of consultations and initiatives intended to improve retail investor protections, which the ec reflected in new or updated directives and regulations. the resulting review of mifid, introduction of aifmd, the introduction of mifid ii and the revision of the ucits directive have increased the compliance, disclosure and other obligations blackrock faces in the european economic area. once fully implemented, these directives will have significant and wide-ranging impacts on eu securities and derivative markets, products and distribution, and internal governance arrangements, which will directly and indirectly impact blackrock's eu regulated subsidiaries and other group companies.
•   reform of european retail distribution: blackrock must also comply with retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures by banning the payment of commissions to distributors and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. the rules were originally introduced in the united kingdom in 2012 and similar rules have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where blackrock operates such as the netherlands, and are under discussion elsewhere. similarly, mifid ii will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. these rules will lead to greater fragmentation of distribution rules and may lead to changes to blackrock's client servicing and distribution models, in particular affecting the fees blackrock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners.
blackrock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock's activities. certain of blackrock's subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the sec, federal reserve, occ, dol, cftc and fca. similarly, from time to time, blackrock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various u.s. and non-u.s. governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. these examinations, inquiries and proceedings, have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant regulator to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations. any such action may also result in litigation by investors in blackrock's funds, other blackrock clients or by blackrock's shareholders, which could harm the company's reputation and may cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the company being liable for damages.
in addition, when clients retain blackrock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that blackrock must observe in the provision of its services. a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose blackrock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.
as blackrock's business continues to grow, the company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. in addition, the sec and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts. blackrock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues. however, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the company fails, or appears to fail, to appropriately deal with any conflict of interest, it may face reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, or penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
as described in "item 1-business-regulation", pnc owns approximately 22% of blackrock's capital stock. based on the federal reserve's interpretation of the bhc act, the federal reserve takes the position that this ownership interest causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for purposes of the bhc act, thereby subjecting blackrock to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve. such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that a nonbank subsidiary may conduct. the federal reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries, including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that, in the federal reserve's opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice, and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. pnc is regulated as a "financial holding company" under the bhc act, which allows pnc and blackrock to engage in a much broader set of activities than would otherwise be permitted under the bhc act; any failure of pnc to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain blackrock activities and its growth.
in addition, blackrock's trust bank subsidiary, which is organized as a national bank, is separately subject to banking regulation by the occ. the occ has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over blackrock's trust bank subsidiary and also subjects it to capital requirements. being subject to banking regulation may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.
of note among the various international regulations to which blackrock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the company. the specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. blackrock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures. despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions will occasionally occur in the future. any such errors may expose blackrock to monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on blackrock's reputation and may cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
new tax legislation or changes in u.s. and foreign tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to blackrock's historical taxation practices may adversely affect blackrock's effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.
blackrock's businesses may be affected by new tax legislation or regulations, or the modification of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings, by u.s. or non-u.s. authorities. in particular, fatca and the crs have introduced new investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring persons with financial assets outside of their tax residence country pay appropriate taxes. fatca and crs will impact both u.s. and non-u.s. funds and subject blackrock to additional administrative burdens. similarly, certain eu member states have enacted ftts, which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions. several other eu member states continue to discuss introducing ftts. if introduced as proposed, ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock's financial results and on clients' performance results. in addition, in october 2015 the oecd released its final beps package in an effort to curb the use of certain tax regimes and elements of tax planning, primarily in a cross-border context. the final package was endorsed by the g20 and is subject to implementation. beps contains a number of provisions that may negatively impact cross-border investing using commingled investment vehicles. in addition, in january 2016, the european commission announced an anti-tax avoidance package ("eu package") for consideration by the european parliament and council containing measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning further and to boost tax transparency.  once implemented, the beps package and the eu package could curtail the amount of investments channeled by, and have unintended taxation consequences for, funds as well as the blackrock's overall tax position, which could adversely affect blackrock's financial condition and that of its clients.
the company also manages significant assets in products and accounts that have specific tax objectives, which could be adversely impacted by changes in tax law or policy, particularly with respect to u.s. municipal income, the u.s. individual income tax rate on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains and, globally, alternative products. the application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, u.s. and non-u.s. tax authorities may review and challenge blackrock's historical tax positions. these challenges may result in adjustments to blackrock's tax position, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect blackrock's effective tax rate and overall financial condition.
risks related to blackrock's significant shareholder pnc owns a large portion of blackrock's capital stock. future sales or distributions of blackrock's common stock in the public market by the company or pnc could adversely affect the trading price of blackrock's common stock.
as of december 31, 2015, pnc owned 22% of the company's capital stock. sales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of blackrock's common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales or distributions might occur, may cause the market price of blackrock's common stock to decline.
pnc has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock's board of directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of pnc.
as discussed in blackrock's proxy statement, pnc has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock's board of directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with blackrock. as a consequence, if the shares held by pnc constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determination of the blackrock board of directors. this arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over blackrock in its board of directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the board.
as discussed in blackrock's proxy statement, pursuant to blackrock's stockholder agreement with pnc, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office:
•   appointment of a new chief executive officer of blackrock;
•   any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of blackrock capital stock would be held by persons different than those currently holding such majority of the total voting power, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of blackrock;
•   any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of blackrock's consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of blackrock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of blackrock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;
•   any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business blackrock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of blackrock on a consolidated basis;
•   except for repurchases otherwise permitted under the stockholder agreement, any repurchase by blackrock or any subsidiary of shares of blackrock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase blackrock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of blackrock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;
•   any amendment to blackrock's certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or
•   any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the nyse.
additionally, blackrock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of pnc:
•   any sale of any subsidiary of blackrock, the annualized revenue of which, together with the annualized revenue of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenue of blackrock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;
•   for so long as blackrock is a subsidiary of pnc for purposes of the bhc act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the bhc act;
•   any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between blackrock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of blackrock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to pnc or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of blackrock capital stock than to pnc;
•   any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of blackrock's certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of pnc or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of blackrock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause pnc or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements this report, and other statements that blackrock may make, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act, with respect to blackrock's future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as "trend," "potential," "opportunity," "pipeline," "believe," "comfortable," "expect," "anticipate," "current," "intention," "estimate," "position," "assume," "outlook," "continue," "remain," "maintain," "sustain," "seek," "achieve," and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could," "may" and similar expressions.

gaap.    operating income of $4,664 million increased $190 million and operating margin of 40.9% increased 50 bps from 2014. operating income reflected growth in base fees and performance fees, partially offset by higher expense. the company's 2015 expense reflected higher revenue-related expense, including compensation, and distribution and servicing costs, partially offset by lower general and administration expense and lower amortization of intangible assets.  in connection with the barclays global investors ("bgi") acquisition, blackrock recorded a $50 million indemnification asset for unrecognized tax benefits. due to the resolution of outstanding tax matters in 2014, blackrock recorded $50 million of general and administration expense in 2014 to reflect the reduction of the indemnification asset and an offsetting $50 million tax benefit.  results for 2014 also included $11 million of closed-end fund launch costs. nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, decreased $20 million from 2014 due to lower net gains on investments in 2015.
income tax expense for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities, including the effect of tax legislation enacted in the united kingdom and state and local income tax changes and benefited from $75 million of nonrecurring items.  income tax expense for 2014 included $94 million of tax benefits, including the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above, a $9 million net noncash benefit, primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities as a result of domestic state and local tax changes, and a $73 million net tax benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items.
diluted earnings per common share rose $0.54, or 3%, compared with the prior year period, reflecting higher operating income and the benefit of share repurchases, partially offset by the impact of a higher 2015 effective tax rate and lower nonoperating income.
as adjusted.    operating income of $4,695 million increased $132 million from 2014 and the operating margin for both 2015 and 2014 was 42.9%. income tax expense on an as adjusted basis for 2015 included a $75 million net benefit and excluded the net noncash benefit of $54 million described above. general and administration expense for 2014 excluded the $50 million related to the reduction of the indemnification asset described above.  income tax expense for 2014 included a $73 million net benefit and excluded a $50 million tax benefit associated with the reduction of the same indemnification asset and $9 million of net noncash benefits described above.  diluted earnings per common share rose $0.26, or 1%, from 2014.
gaap. operating income of $4,474 million increased $617 million from 2013, reflecting growth in base fees and blackrock solutions and advisory revenue, partially offset by higher expense. the company's 2014 expense reflected higher revenue-related expense, including compensation and direct fund expense. expense for 2014 also included the previously mentioned $50 million general and administration expense related to the reduction of an indemnification asset and $11 million of closed-end fund launch costs. the 2013 expense included $124 million of expense related to the charitable contribution described below and $18 million of closed-end fund launch costs.
nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, decreased $146 million from 2013. expense for 2013 included a $39 million noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain related to the carrying value of the company's equity method investment as a result of an initial public offering of pennymac financial services, inc. (the "pennymac ipo"). in addition, in 2013, the company made a charitable contribution of approximately six million units of the company's investment in pennymac to a donor advised fund (the "charitable contribution"). in connection with the charitable contribution, the company also recorded a noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed investment. the decrease in nonoperating income (expense) also reflected net lower returns on the co-investment and seed portfolio and higher interest expense resulting from a long-term debt issuance in march 2014, partially offset by the positive impact of the monetization of a nonstrategic, opportunistic private equity investment during 2014.
income tax expense of $1,131 million included $94 million of tax benefits, including the $50 million tax benefit mentioned above. income tax expense for 2014 and 2013 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. income tax expense for 2014 included a $9 million net noncash benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes and a $73 million net benefit related to several favorable nonrecurring items. income tax expense for 2013 included a $69 million noncash benefit, primarily related to legislation enacted in the united kingdom and state and local income tax changes. in addition, 2013 income tax expense included a benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the charitable contribution, a benefit of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the realization of tax loss carryforwards, and benefits from certain nonrecurring items.
diluted earnings per common share rose $2.38, or 14%, from 2013 due to higher net income and the benefit of share repurchases.
as adjusted. operating income of $4,563 million and operating margin of 42.9% increased $539 million and 150 basis points, respectively, from 2013. results for 2014 excluded a $50 million general and administrative expense related to the reduction of an indemnification asset. the 2014 income tax expense included a $73 million net benefit and excluded a $50 million tax benefit associated with the reduction of the same indemnification asset and $9 million of net noncash benefits described above. the 2013 results excluded the financial impact of the charitable contribution, but included the $39 million pre-tax nonoperating gain related to the pennymac ipo. the 2013 income tax expense included a benefit of approximately $29 million and benefits from certain nonrecurring items and excluded the $69 million net noncash benefit, described above. diluted earnings per common share rose $2.76, or 17%, from 2013.

blackrock believes institutional results will be driven by strength in specialty areas, including defined contribution, financial institutions, official institutions and foundations, family offices and endowments; deepening client relationships through effective cross-selling efforts; enhancing blackrock's solutions-oriented approach and leveraging blackrock solutions' analytical and risk management expertise.
non-gaap financial measures blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with gaap; however, management believes evaluating the company's ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-gaap financial measures. management reviews non-gaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of blackrock's financial performance over time. management also uses non-gaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. non-gaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock's revenue and expense. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
management uses both gaap and non-gaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock's financial performance. adjustments to gaap financial measures ("non-gaap adjustments") include certain items management deems nonrecurring or occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:
(1) operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:
management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of blackrock's financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.
operating income, gaap basis                                                       $4,664                $4,474                $3,857
non-gaap expense adjustments:
compensation plans reduction of indemnification asset                                                      -                    50                     -
operating income, as adjusted                                                       4,695                 4,563                 4,024
operating income used for operating margin measurement                             $4,700                $4,574                $4,042
non-gaap adjustments:
amortization of deferred sales commissions                                            (48   )               (56   )               (52   )
revenue used for operating margin measurement                                     $10,944               $10,661                $9,775
operating margin, gaap basis                                                         40.9   %              40.4   %              37.9   %
operating margin, as adjusted                                                        42.9   %              42.9   %              41.4   %
•   operating income, as adjusted, includes non-gaap expense adjustments. the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans ("ltip") funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of blackrock stock held by pnc has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact blackrock's book value. compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense). in 2014, general and administration expense relating to the reduction of an indemnification asset has been excluded since it is directly offset by a tax benefit of the same amount and, consequently, does not impact blackrock's book value. in 2013, the $124 million expense related to the charitable contribution was excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature and because the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million directly related to the contributed pennymac investment is reported in nonoperating income (expense).
•   operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact blackrock's results until future periods.
revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties. management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue the company earns. for each of these items, blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenue.
(2) nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, as adjusted:
nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, as adjusted, equals nonoperating income (expense), gaap basis, less net income (loss) attributable to nci, adjusted for compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans. the compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. this compensation expense has been included in nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in nonoperating income (expense), gaap basis.
during 2013, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $80 million related to the contributed pennymac investment was excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, as adjusted due to its nonrecurring nature and because the more than offsetting associated charitable contribution expense of $124 million is reported in operating income.
nonoperating income (expense), gaap basis                                                    $(62       )       $(79       )           $116
nonoperating income (expense), net of nci                                                         (69   )            (49   )             97
compensation plans nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to nci, as adjusted       $(70       )       $(56       )             $7
non-gaap adjustments:
pnc ltip funding obligation, net of tax                                22                  25                  23
amount related to the charitable contribution, net of tax               -                   -                  (4   )
see the aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation and the charitable contribution.
for each period presented, the non-gaap adjustment related to the pnc ltip funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. amounts for 2013 included a tax benefit of approximately $48 million recognized in connection with the charitable contribution. the tax benefit has been excluded from net income attributable to blackrock, inc., as adjusted due to the nonrecurring nature of the charitable contribution.
non-gaap income tax matters adjustments for 2015, 2014 and 2013 reflected the revaluation of deferred income tax liabilities. the amount for 2015 included a $54 million net noncash benefit, primarily related to the impact of legislation enacted in the united kingdom and state and local income tax changes. the amount for 2014 included a $9 million net noncash tax benefit arising primarily from state and local income tax changes. the amount for 2013 included a $69 million noncash tax benefit, primarily related to the impact of legislation enacted in the united kingdom and state and local income tax changes. such amounts for 2015, 2014 and 2013 have been excluded from as adjusted results as they will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.

assets under management aum for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio aum.

aum decreased $6.5 billion to $4.645 trillion at december 31, 2015 from $4.652 trillion at december 31, 2014 driven largely by foreign exchange movements and net market depreciation that more than offset organic growth.
net market depreciation of $57.5 billion was driven by $35.3 billion from equity products due to lower u.s. and global equity markets and $12.1 billion from fixed income products.
aum decreased $101.1 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, the british pound and the canadian dollar.

aum increased $327.8 billion, or 8%, to $4.652 trillion at december 31, 2014 from $4.324 trillion at december 31, 2013. the increase in aum was driven by net market appreciation of $261.7 billion and net inflows of $193.8 billion, partially offset by foreign exchange movements.
net market appreciation of $261.7 billion included $140.8 billion of growth in equity products primarily due to higher u.s. equity markets, and appreciation of $98.8 billion and $21.0 billion in fixed income and multi-asset products, respectively, across the majority of strategies.
aum decreased $127.7 billion from foreign exchange movements, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, the british pound and the japanese yen.
discussion of financial results introduction blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed. such fees are primarily based on predetermined percentages of the market value of aum or percentages of committed capital during investment periods of certain alternative products and are affected by changes in aum, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-u.s. dollar denominated aum into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes.
blackrock also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. generally, the revenue earned is shared between blackrock and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed. historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand.
investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on aum. investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. as such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of blackrock's revenue and earnings. the magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either september 30 or december 31.
blackrock provides a variety of risk management, investment analytic and investment system and advisory services to financial institutions, pension funds, asset managers, foundations, consultants, mutual fund sponsors, real estate investment trusts and government agencies. these services are provided under the brand name blackrock solutions and include a wide array of risk management services, valuation services related to illiquid securities, disposition and workout assignments (including long-term portfolio liquidation assignments), strategic planning and execution, and enterprise investment system outsourcing to clients. the company's aladdin operating platform serves as the investment/risk solutions system for blackrock and other institutional investors. fees earned for blackrock solutions and advisory services are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met.
blackrock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. through its scale and diversity of products, it is able to provide its clients with customized solutions including fiduciary outsourcing for liability-driven investments and overlay strategies for pension plan sponsors, balance sheet management and related services for insurance companies and target date and target return funds, as well as asset allocation portfolios, for retail investors. blackrock is also able to service these clients via its aladdin platform to provide risk management and other outsourcing services for institutional investors and custom and tailored solutions to address complex risk exposures.
the company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions from acting as a broker-dealer in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. commissions related to transition management services are recorded on a trade-date basis as securities transactions occur.
the company also earns revenue related to certain strategic investments accounted for as equity method investments.
operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, amortization of deferred sales commissions, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.
•   employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs.
•   distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily aum driven, include payments made to merrill lynch-affiliated entities under a global distribution agreement, to pnc and barclays, as well as other third parties, primarily associated with obtaining and retaining client investments in certain blackrock products.
•   direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expense incurred by blackrock related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expense directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. these expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in aum, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.
general and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, closed-end fund launch costs and other general and administration expense, including the impact of foreign currency remeasurement. foreign currency remeasurement (gains) losses were $(8) million, $(11) million and $1 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
approximately 75% of the company's revenue is generated in u.s. dollars. the company's revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the euro and british pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the company's considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the united states.
nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments (excluding available-for-sale investments) and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. other comprehensive income includes changes in valuations related to available-for-sale investments. blackrock primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real estate. investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including federal reserve bank stock. blackrock does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.
in addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds. the portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to blackrock is allocated to nci on the consolidated statements of income.

balance sheet overview as adjusted balance sheet the following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a gaap basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment funds, including consolidated vies.
the company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders' equity or cash flows. management views the as adjusted balance sheet, a non-gaap financial measure, as an economic presentation of the company's total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
separate account assets and liabilities and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements separate account assets are maintained by blackrock life limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, which is a registered life insurance company in the united kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. the company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. the separate account assets are not available to creditors of the company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the company's assets. the net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the company's consolidated statements of income. while blackrock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, blackrock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
in addition, the company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under blackrock life limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. the collateral is not available to creditors of the company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the company's assets.
consolidated sponsored investment funds the company consolidates certain sponsored investment funds accounted for as voting rights entities ("vres") and vies, (collectively, "consolidated sponsored investment funds"). see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this form 10-k for further information of the company's consolidation policy.
the company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment funds to use in its operating activities. in addition, the company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment funds in order to obtain cash for use in the company's operations.

the following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a gaap basis. please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing. the discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on blackrock's stockholders' equity.
assets. cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2015 and 2014 included $100 million and $120 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment funds (see liquidity and capital resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2015).
accounts receivable at december 31, 2015 increased $117 million from december 31, 2014 due to an increase in unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within accounts payable and accrued liabilities) and higher performance fee receivables. investments were $1,578 million at december 31, 2015 (for more information see investments herein). goodwill and intangible assets increased $190 million from december 31, 2014, primarily due to the bkca, infraestructura institucional and futureadvisor acquisitions, partially offset by $128 million of amortization of intangible assets. other assets (including property, plant and equipment) increased $284 million from december 31, 2014, primarily related to an increase in property and equipment, higher earnings from certain strategic investments, and an increase in current taxes receivable.
liabilities. accrued compensation and benefits at december 31, 2015 increased $106 million from december 31, 2014, primarily due to 2015 incentive compensation accruals. accounts payable and accrued liabilities at december 31, 2015 increased $33 million from december 31, 2014 due to higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within accounts receivable) and increased accruals, partially offset by a decrease in current income taxes payable.
net deferred income tax liabilities at december 31, 2015 decreased $138 million, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with stock compensation, the bkca acquisition, realization of loss carryforwards, and goodwill and intangibles. other liabilities increased $147 million from december 31, 2014, primarily resulting from an increase in uncertain tax positions and consolidated funds liabilities.
investments and investments of consolidated vies the company's investments and investments of consolidated vies (collectively, "total investments") were $1,578 million and $1,030 million, respectively, at december 31, 2015. total investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment funds accounted for as vres and vies. management reviews blackrock's total investments on an "economic" basis, which eliminates the portion of total investments that does not impact blackrock's book value or net income attributable to blackrock. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
the company presents total investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of its total investments that is owned by the company, net of nci, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to blackrock.
the company further presents net "economic" investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another gauge for investors.  the economic impact of total investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is substantially offset by a change in compensation expense. the impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to blackrock's stockholders' equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. finally, the company's regulatory investment in federal reserve bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the company's net economic investment exposure.
total "economic" investment exposure                      $1,548                $1,319
(1)   amounts represent investments held in sponsored investment funds that are consolidated in accordance with gaap as either a vie or vre. see note 2, significant accounting policies, for further information on the company's consolidation policy and the 2015 adoption of asu 2015-02.
(2)   amount includes $81 million of carried interest (vies), which has no impact on the company's "economic" investment exposure.
the following table represents the carrying value of the company's economic investment exposure, by asset type, at december 31, 2015 and 2014:
total "economic" investment exposure            $1,548            $1,319

liquidity and capital resources blackrock cash flows excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds the consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the consolidated sponsored investment funds. the company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, as a supplemental non-gaap measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. the company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated
sponsored investment funds, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of blackrock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with gaap.
the following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of consolidated sponsored investment funds:

sources of blackrock's operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, revenue from blackrock solutions and advisory products and services, other revenue and distribution fees. blackrock uses its cash to pay all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on blackrock's capital stock, repurchases of the company's stock, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
cash flows from operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and other revenue offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
cash outflows from investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for 2015 were $309 million and primarily reflected $412 million of investment purchases, $221 million of purchases of property and equipment and $273 million related to certain acquisitions, partially offset by $531 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments.
cash outflows from financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment funds, for 2015 were $2,548 million, primarily resulting from $1.3 billion of share repurchases, including $1.1 billion in open-market transactions and $231 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions and $1.5 billion of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $126 million of proceeds from stock options and $105 million of excess tax benefits from vested stock-based compensation awards.
the company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. liquidity resources at december 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
total liquidity resources(3)                                                                            $9,983                $9,593
(1)   the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the company's u.s. subsidiaries was approximately 50% at both december 31, 2015 and 2014. see net capital requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.
(2)   the company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities.
(3)   amounts do not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals of approximately $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion for 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were paid in february of the following year.
total liquidity resources increased $390 million during 2015, primarily reflecting cash from operations, partially offset by cash payments of 2014 year-end incentive awards, share repurchases of $1.3 billion and cash dividend payments.
a significant portion of the company's $2,227 million of total investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
share repurchases. the company repurchased 3.1 million common shares in open market-transactions under the share repurchase program for approximately $1.1 billion during 2015. at december 31, 2015, there were 6.3 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.
net capital requirements. the company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. as a result, such subsidiaries of the company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions, including repatriation to the united states, may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
blackrock institutional trust company, n.a. ("btc") is chartered as a national bank that does not accept client deposits and whose powers are limited to trust activities. btc provides investment management services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional investors and other clients. btc is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the office of the comptroller of the currency.
at both december 31, 2015 and 2014, the company was required to maintain approximately $1.1 billion in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including btc, entities regulated by the financial conduct authority and prudential regulation authority in the united kingdom, and the company's broker-dealers. the company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2015, the company has not provided for u.s. federal and state income taxes on approximately $4.7 billion of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. the company's current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds.
2015 revolving credit facility. in april 2015, the company's credit facility was further amended to extend the maturity date to march 2020 and to increase the amount of the aggregate commitment to $4.0 billion (the "2015 credit facility"). the 2015 credit facility permits the company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2015 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5.0 billion. interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable london interbank offered rate plus a spread. the 2015 credit facility requires the company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at december 31, 2015. the 2015 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. at december 31, 2015, the company had no amount outstanding under the 2015 credit facility.
commercial paper program. the maximum aggregate amount for which the company could issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the "cp notes") on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4.0 billion as amended in april 2015. the commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2015 credit facility. at december 31, 2015, blackrock had no cp notes outstanding.
the carrying value of long-term borrowings at december 31, 2015 included the following:
during 2015, the company fully repaid $750 million of 1.375% notes at maturity. in may 2015, the company issued €700 million of 1.25% senior unsecured notes maturing in may 2025. upon conversion to u.s. dollars the company designated the €700 million debt offering as a net investment hedge to offset its currency exposure relating to its net investment in certain euro functional currency operations. for more information on company's borrowings, see note 12, borrowings, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this form 10-k.
contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at december 31, 2015:
operating leases                                                  134               133           131               125           120             560         1,203
contingent payments related to business acquisitions(1)            12                 8            21                10            12               -            63
(1)   the amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payment amounts using foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2015 under the terms of the business acquisition's agreement. the fair value of the contingent obligations is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition and is recorded within other liabilities.
(2)   at december 31, 2015, the company had approximately $350 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above.
operating leases. the company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2035. in connection with certain lease agreements, the company is responsible for escalation payments. the contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments. these leases are classified as operating leases and, as such, are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
purchase obligations. in the ordinary course of business, blackrock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of blackrock. purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. at december 31, 2015, the company's obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio services, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31, 2015.
investment commitments. at december 31, 2015, the company had $179 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment funds, including consolidated vies.  these funds include private equity funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds and opportunistic funds. this amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. in addition to the capital commitments of $179 million, the company had approximately $38 million of contingent commitments for certain funds which have investment periods that have expired. generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. these unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. these commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the company that are not yet legally binding. the company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
contingent distribution obligations. in november 2010, blackrock entered into a second amended and restated global distribution agreement with merrill lynch, which requires the company to make payments to merrill lynch contingent upon sales of products and level of aum maintained in certain blackrock products. the initial term of the agreement remained in effect until january 2014 and was renewed for one automatic three-year extension.
contingent payments related to business acquisitions. in connection with certain acquisitions, blackrock is required to make contingent payments, subject to the acquired businesses achieving specified performance targets over a certain period, subsequent to the applicable acquisition date.
the fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at december 31, 2015 is included in other liabilities and is not significant to the consolidated statement of financial condition.
carried interest clawback. as a general partner in certain investment funds, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. the company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. therefore, blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in total investments, or cash/cash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability/other liabilities of consolidated vies on its consolidated statements of financial condition. carried interest is recorded as performance fees on blackrock's consolidated statements of income upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable.
indemnifications. in the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, blackrock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. the terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31, 2015. see further discussion in note 13, commitments and contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this form 10-k.
on behalf of certain clients, the company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. in these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. blackrock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower's failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower's obligation under the securities lending agreement. at december 31, 2015, the company indemnified certain of its clients for their securities lending loan balances of approximately $169.3 billion. the company held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $179.6 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31, 2015. the fair value of these indemnifications was not material at december 31, 2015.
while the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower's obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. if the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the company has provided indemnification, blackrock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
compensation and benefit obligations. the company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. accrued compensation and benefits at december 31, 2015 totaled $1,971 million and included incentive compensation of $1,452 million, deferred compensation of $266 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $253 million. substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2016, while the deferred compensation obligations are generally payable over periods of up to five years.
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this form 10-k.
consolidation in the normal course of business, the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. the company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a vie or a vre. assessing whether an entity is a vie or a vre involves judgment and analysis. factors considered in this assessment include the entity's legal organization, the entity's capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. investments that are determined to be vres are consolidated if the company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. see note 4, consolidated voting right entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this form 10-k for more information. investments that are determined to be vies are consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary ("pb") of the entity.
at december 31, 2015, blackrock was determined to be the pb for certain investment products that were determined to be vies, which required blackrock to consolidate them. blackrock was deemed to be the pb because it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie. see note 5, variable interest entities, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this form 10-k for more information.
see note 2, significant accounting policies - accounting pronouncements adopted in 2015, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this form 10-k for more information on asu 2015-02.
investments equity method investments. for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee, and where it is not the pb of a vie, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the company follows the equity method of accounting. the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of blackrock's advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund's operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity.
blackrock's equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. therefore, under the equity method of accounting, blackrock's share of the investee's underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. blackrock's share of the investee's underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as other revenue for certain strategic investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock's core business.
at december 31, 2015, the company had $527 million and $265 million of equity method investments, including equity method investments held for deferred compensation, reflected within investments and other assets, respectively, and at december 31, 2014, the company had $654 million and $208 million of equity method investees reflected in investments and other assets, respectively.
impairments of investments. management periodically assesses equity method, available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and cost investments for other-than-temporary impairment ("otti"). if an otti exists, an impairment charge is recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of the income.
for equity method, held-to-maturity and cost method investments, if circumstances indicate that an otti may exist, the investments are evaluated using market values, where available, or the expected future cash flows of the investment. if the company determines an otti exists, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value.
for available-for-sale securities, when the fair value is lower than cost, the company considers, among other factors, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, the extent to which the security's fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the security's issuer and the company's ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. for equity securities, if the impairment is considered other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value. for debt securities, the company considers whether: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery; or (3) it expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. if the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the
security, the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value must be recognized in earnings.  if the company does not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security but the security has suffered an impairment related to credit, the credit loss will be bifurcated from the total decline in value and recorded in earnings with the remaining portion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
for the company's investments in clos, the company reviews cash flow estimates over the life of each clo investment. on a quarterly basis, if the present value of the estimated future cash flows is lower than the carrying value of the investment and there is an adverse change in estimated cash flows, an impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its estimated fair value.
evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income.
fair value measurements the company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this form 10-k for more information on fair value measurements.
changes in valuation. changes in value on $2,261 million of total investments will impact the company's nonoperating income (expense), $44 million will impact accumulated other comprehensive income, $203 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $100 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). at december 31, 2015, changes in fair value of approximately $1,649 million of such consolidated vies/vres will impact blackrock's net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income. blackrock's net exposure to changes in fair value of such consolidated sponsored investment funds was $1,268 million.
goodwill and intangible assets the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. in addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. in accordance with the applicable provisions of asc 350, intangibles - goodwill and other ("asc 350"), indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds with a specified termination date, are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at december 31, 2015, ranged from 1 to 9 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 3.7 years.
goodwill. the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company. the impairment assessment performed as of july 31, 2015 indicated no impairment charge was required. the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. at december 31, 2015, the company's common stock closed at $340.52, which exceeded its book value of approximately $172.12 per share.
indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate.
in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum, revenue basis points, projected aum growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. in addition, the company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity's services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) entity-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. if an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
for finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
in addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $128 million, $157 million and $161 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. the company determined that no impairment charges were required, the classification of indefinite-lived versus
finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles were required. the company continuously monitors various factors, including aum, for potential indicators of impairment.
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company's current estimates. at december 31, 2015, blackrock had $466 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $320 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. at december 31, 2015, the company had deferred tax assets of $20 million and net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $4,851 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company.
the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. the assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. the company's actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $166 million and current income taxes payables of $79 million at december 31, 2015.
revenue recognition investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed. such fees are primarily based on pre-determined percentages of the market value of aum or, in the case of certain real estate clients, net operating income generated by the underlying properties. investment advisory and administration fees are affected by changes in aum, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. investment advisory and administration fees for investment funds are shown net of fees waived pursuant to contractual expense limitations of the funds or voluntary waivers.
the company contracts with third parties and related parties for various fund distribution and shareholder servicing to be performed on behalf of certain funds the company manages. such arrangements generally are priced as a portion of the management fee paid by the fund. in certain cases, the fund takes on the primary responsibility for payment for services such that the company bears no credit risk to the third-party. the company accounts for such retrocession arrangements in accordance with asc 605-45, revenue recognition - principal agent considerations ("asc 605-45"), and records its management fees net of retrocessions. retrocessions for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $870 million, $891 million and $785 million, respectively. the company has additional contracts for similar services with third parties, which due to the terms of the contracts, are recorded as distribution and servicing costs and thus not netted on the consolidated statements of income.
the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. revenue is accounted for on an accrual basis. the securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. generally, the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed. for 2015, 2014 and 2013, securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled $513 million, $477 million and $447 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.
the company receives investment advisory performance fees or incentive allocations, from certain actively managed investment funds and certain smas. these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds. such fees are recorded upon completion of the measurement period, which varies by product or account, and could be monthly, quarterly, annually or longer.
in addition, the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. blackrock may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations depending upon future performance of these funds. therefore, blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in total investments or cash/cash of consolidated vies to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. carried interest is recorded as performance fee revenue upon the earlier of the termination of the investment fund or when the likelihood of clawback is considered mathematically improbable.
the company records a deferred carried interest liability to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the company had $143 million and $105 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities/other liabilities of consolidated vies on the consolidated statements of financial condition. a portion of the deferred carried interest liability will be paid to certain employees. the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue, if any, for these products is unknown.
the following table presents changes in the deferred carried interest liability (including the portion related to consolidated vies) for 2015 and 2014:
performance fee revenue recognized            (31   )            (72   )
for 2015, 2014 and 2013, performance fee revenue totaled $621 million, $550 million and $561 million, respectively.
fees earned for blackrock solutions, which include advisory services, are recorded as services are performed or when completed and are determined using some, or all, of the following methods: (i) percentages of various attributes of advisory aum or value of positions on the aladdin platform, (ii) fixed fees and (iii) performance fees if contractual thresholds are met. revenue earned on advisory assignments was comprised of one-time advisory and portfolio structuring fees and ongoing fees based on aum of the respective portfolio assignment. for 2015, 2014 and 2013, blackrock solutions and advisory revenue totaled $646 million, $635 million and $577 million, respectively.
adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock's investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance revenue until performance thresholds have been exceeded and the likelihood of clawback is mathematically improbable.

item 1a.   risk factors information provided by the company or its spokespersons, including information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, may from time to time contain forward-looking statements concerning projected financial performance, market and industry sector growth, product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations. such statements will be based on the assumptions and expectations of the company's management at the time such statements are made. the company cautions investors that its performance (and, therefore, any forward-looking statement) is subject to risks and uncertainties. various important factors, including, but not limited to, the following may cause the company's future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.
global economic conditions. the company's operations and performance depend significantly on foreign and domestic economic conditions. uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, as well as geopolitical conditions, have resulted in significant volatility in credit, equity and foreign currency markets. this volatility and the related economic conditions may
negatively impact the company as customers defer spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declining valuations of investments and other factors. in addition, certain of the company's customers' budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to purchase the company's products at the same level as they have in prior periods. customer spending levels may be impacted by decreased government spending in certain countries as concerns continue regarding economic conditions and government debt levels. these conditions may persist or further deteriorate for an extended period of time. as the global economy continues to experience volatility, the company may be exposed to impairments of certain assets as their values deteriorate.
tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish the company's future borrowing ability. the company's customers' ability to pay for the company's products and services may also be impaired, which may lead to an increase in the company's allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable. since the company is exposed to the majority of major world markets, uncertainty in any significant market may negatively impact the company's performance and results, particularly with respect to the company's largest geographic customer bases. the company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of changing economic conditions or the likelihood of additional uncertainty arising in any of the company's key markets. should these economic conditions result in the company not meeting its revenue growth objectives, the company's operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.
decline in customers' businesses. the company's sales are based significantly on end-user demand for products in key industrial sectors. many of these sectors periodically experience economic declines, which may be exacerbated by other economic factors. these factors may also adversely affect the company's business by extending sales cycles and reducing revenue. these economic factors may cause the company's customers to reduce the size of their workforce or cut back on operations and may lead to a reduction in renewals of licenses or maintenance contracts with the company. the company's customers may request discounts or extended payment terms on new products or seek to extend payment terms on existing contracts, all of which may cause fluctuations in the company's future operating results. the company may not be able to adjust its operating expenses to offset such fluctuations because a substantial portion of the company's operating expenses is related to personnel, facilities and marketing programs. the level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based, in significant part, on the company's expectation for future revenue.
risks associated with international activities. a majority of the company's business comes from outside the united states and the company has customers that supply a wide spectrum of goods and services in virtually all of the world's major economic regions. as the company continues to expand its sales presence in international regions, the portion of its revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase. if any of the foreign economies in which the company does business deteriorate or suffer periods of uncertainty, the company's business and performance may be negatively impacted through reduced customer spending, changes in purchasing cycles or timing, reduced access to credit for its customers, or other factors impacting the company's international sales and collections. the company's results may also be negatively impacted by geopolitical tensions, which may result in increased economic volatility.
as a result of its increasing international activities, the company has revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies. as a result, the company is subject to currency exchange risk. the company's revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the u.s. dollar weakens. as a result, changes in currency exchange rates will affect the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. in the event that there are economic declines in countries in which the company conducts transactions, the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may affect the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the company is most impacted by movements in and among the euro, japanese yen, south korean won, british pound, canadian dollar, indian rupee and u.s. dollar. the company seeks to reduce currency exchange transaction risks primarily through its normal operating and treasury activities, but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in reducing these risks.
additional risks inherent in the company's international business activities include imposition of government controls; export license requirements; restrictions on the export of critical technology, products and services; the violation of anti-corruption laws and regulations, which are applicable to the company, by third parties in countries where such conduct may be permissible or commonplace; political and economic instability; trade restrictions; changes in tariffs and taxes; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; changes in data privacy regulations; longer accounts receivable payment cycles; and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations. effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every foreign country in which the company sells its products and services. the company's business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially, adversely affected by any of these risks.
sales forecasts. the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts. the company's sales personnel continually monitor the status of all proposals, including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale, in order to forecast quarterly sales. these forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors, including global economic conditions and the performance of the company's customers. a variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause the company to plan or budget incorrectly and, therefore, could adversely affect the company's business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. the company's management team forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments, and integrates them through long-range planning into budgets, research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties. global economic conditions, and the effect those conditions and other disruptions in global markets have on the company's customers, may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the company's sales forecasts. these conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and the company's sales forecasts and, as a result, the company's performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions. this, in turn, may adversely affect the company's business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
stock market and stock price volatility. market prices for securities of software companies have generally been volatile. in particular, the market price of the company's common stock has been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations as a result of factors affecting the company, the software industry or the securities markets in general. such factors include, but are not limited to, declines in trading price that may be triggered by the company's failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors. moreover, the trading price could be subject to additional fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in the company's operating results, material announcements made by the company or its competitors, conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally, or other events and factors, many of which are beyond the company's control.
rapidly changing technology; new products; risk of product errors. the company operates in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions, which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable. a major factor in the company's future success will be its ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce, in a timely manner, enhancements to its existing products, products acquired in acquisitions and new products to meet those changes. if the company is unable to introduce new products and to respond quickly to industry changes, its business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially, adversely affected.
the introduction and marketing of new or enhanced products require the company to manage the transition from existing products in order to minimize disruption in customer purchasing patterns. there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, new products or product enhancements, that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that the company will successfully manage the transition from existing products. software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors when first introduced, or as new versions are released, and the likelihood of errors is increased as a result of the company's commitment to the frequency of its product releases. there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments. certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise. the ability of the company's sales channel, particularly the indirect channel, to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on the company's sales in future periods. any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to the company's reputation, or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on the company's business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
product quality. the company has separate quality systems and registrations under the iso 9001:2008 standard, in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations. the company's continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales. if the company was determined not to be compliant with various regulatory or iso 9001/9000 standards, its certificates of registration could be suspended, requiring remedial action and a time-consuming re-registration process. product quality issues or failures could result in the company's reputation becoming diminished, resulting in a material, adverse impact on revenue, operating margins, net income, financial position and cash flows.
competition. the company continues to experience competition across all markets for its products and services. some of the company's current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than the company, and some have well-established relationships with current and potential customers of the company. the company's current and possible future competitors also include firms that have competed or may in the future elect to compete by means of open source licensing. parties among the company's current or future strategic alliances may diminish or sever technical, software development and marketing relationships with the company for competitive purposes. these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and/or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.
changes in the company's pricing models. the intense competition the company faces in the sales of its products and services, and general economic and business conditions, can put pressure on the company to adjust its prices. if the company's competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services, or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, the company may need to lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. any such changes may reduce operating margins and could adversely affect operating results. the company's maintenance products, which include software license updates and product support fees, are generally priced as a percentage of its new software license fees. the company's competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support that could put pressure on the company to further discount its new license or product support prices.
any broad-based change to the company's prices and pricing policies could cause new software license and service revenues to decline or be delayed as its sales force implements and its customers adjust to the new pricing policies. some of the company's competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices, product implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions. these practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that the company can charge for certain products. if the company does not adapt its pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of its products or changes in customer demand, the company's new software license revenues could decrease. additionally, increased distribution of applications through application service providers, including software-as-a-service providers, may reduce the average price for the company's products or adversely affect other sales of the company's products, reducing new software license revenues unless the company can offset price reductions with volume increases. the increase in open source software distribution may also cause the company to adjust its pricing models.
dependence on senior management and key technical personnel. the company's success depends upon the continued services of the company's senior executives, key technical employees and other employees. each of the company's executive officers, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the company at any time. the loss of any of the company's senior executives might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the company's business objectives and could materially harm the company's business and customer relationships.
in addition, because of the highly technical nature of the company's products, the company must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel, many of whom are recruited from outside of the united states. the market for this talent is highly competitive. the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. if the company has less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel, the company's business, reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
dependence on proprietary technology. the company's success is highly dependent upon its proprietary technology. the company generally relies on contracts and the laws of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets to protect its technology. the company maintains a trade secrets program, enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and channel partners, and limits access to and distribution of its software, documentation and other proprietary information. there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology by third parties, or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technology independently. costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions. although the company is not aware that any of its technology infringes upon the rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that other parties will not assert technology infringement claims against the company or that, if asserted, such claims will not prevail.
risks associated with security of the company's products, source code and it systems. the company makes significant efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of its products, source code, computer systems and data. despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs, it is virtually impossible for the company to entirely mitigate this risk. there appears to be an increasing number of computer "hackers" developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs (such as viruses, worms and the like) that could attack the company's products and computer systems. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. like all software products, the company's software is vulnerable to such attacks. the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of the company's software products, cause errors in the output of its customers' work, allow unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary or confidential information of the company or its customers and result in other destructive outcomes. if this were to occur, the company's reputation may suffer, customers may stop buying products, the company could face lawsuits and potential liability, and the company's financial performance could be negatively impacted.
there is also a danger of industrial espionage, cyber-attacks, misuse, theft of information or assets (including source code), or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to the company's facilities, systems or information. such cybersecurity breaches, misuse or other disruptions could lead to the disclosure of portions of the company's product source code or other confidential information, improper usage and distribution of the company's products without compensation, illegal usage of the company's products which could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through its computer systems, and theft, manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary data, resulting in defective products and production downtimes. although the company actively employs measures to combat unlicensed copying, access and use of software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of the company's rights is inherently difficult. these events could adversely affect the company's financial results or could result in significant claims for damages against it. participating in lawsuits to protect against any such unauthorized access to, usage of or disclosure of any of the company's products or any portion of the company's product source code, or in prosecutions in connection with any such cybersecurity breach, could be costly and time-consuming, and may divert management's attention and adversely affect the market's perception of the company and its products.
policing the unauthorized distribution and use of the company's products is difficult, and software piracy (including online piracy) is a persistent problem. the proliferation of technology designed to circumvent typical software protection measures used in the company's products, and the possibility of methods that circumvent the techniques it employs in its products, may lead to an expansion in piracy or misuse of its products and intellectual property. as a result, and despite the company's efforts to prevent such activities and to prosecute instances of such activities, the company may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of its software, and management's attention may be diverted to address specific instances of piracy or misuse, or to address piracy and misuse in general.
a number of the company's core processes, such as software development, sales and marketing, customer service and financial transactions, rely on its it infrastructure and applications. the company also relies upon third-party products, which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities. malicious software, sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of the company's infrastructure, which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately to production downtime, recovery costs and customer claims. this could have a significant negative impact on the company's business, financial position, profit and cash flows.
the company has implemented a number of measures designed to ensure the security of its information, it resources and other assets. nonetheless, unauthorized users could gain access to its systems through cyber-attacks and steal, use without authorization, and sabotage the company's intellectual property and confidential data. any breach of its it security, misuse or theft could lead to loss of production, recovery costs or litigation brought by employees, customers or business partners, which could have a significant negative impact on the company's business, financial position, profit, cash flows and reputation.
dependence on channel partners. the company continues to distribute a meaningful portion of its products through its global network of independent, regional channel partners. the channel partners sell the company's software products to new and existing customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support. consequently, in certain geographies, the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the channel partners. difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners, such as failure to meet performance criteria or to promote the company's products as aggressively as the company expects, and differences in the handling of customer relationships, could adversely affect the company's performance. additionally, the loss of any major channel partner for any reason, including a channel partner's decision to sell competing products rather than the company's products, could have a material, adverse effect on the company. moreover, the company's future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of its channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote the company's portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base of the company's products. if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so, the company may be unable to sustain revenue growth.
the company has been increasing its number of channel partners, particularly in international locations. the business relationships with these channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for the company. these partners also have a less-established payment history with the company and revenue from these partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense.
during times of significant fluctuations in world currencies, certain channel partners may have solvency issues to the extent that effective hedge transactions are not employed or there is not sufficient working capital. in particular, if the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, certain channel partners who pay the company in u.s. dollars may have trouble paying the company on time or may have trouble distributing the company's products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on such channel partner's cash flows. this may impact the company's ability to distribute its products into certain regions and markets, and may have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations and cash flows.
reliance on perpetual licenses. although the company has historically maintained stable recurring revenue from the sale of software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions, it also has relied on sales of perpetual licenses that involve the payment of a single, up-front fee. historically, these licenses have been more typical in the computer software industry and remain as the preferred licensing approach in certain markets. while revenue generated from software lease licenses and software maintenance subscriptions currently represents a portion of the company's revenue, to the extent that perpetual license revenue continues to represent a significant percentage of total revenue, the company's revenue in any period will depend significantly on sales completed during that period. if customer purchasing patterns shift toward a stronger preference for lease licenses and fewer perpetual licenses, there could be a short-term, adverse impact on the company's revenue and profitability.
in addition, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, which supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. this update could affect the timing and amounts of revenue recognized for perpetual licenses, which could have an adverse impact on the company's revenue and results of operations.
renewal rates for annual lease and maintenance contracts. a substantial portion of the company's license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the company's license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized. as a result, the company's business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may also be adversely impacted during those periods.
risks associated with acquisitions. historically, the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support the company's long-term strategic direction, accelerate innovation, provide increased capabilities to existing products, supply new products and services, expand its customer base and enhance its distribution channels. the company has completed a number of acquisitions in recent years and expects to make additional acquisitions in the future, but may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or, if suitable candidates are identified, the company may not be able to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms. the process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources.
even if the company is able to consummate acquisitions that it believes will be successful, such transactions present many risks including, among others, difficulty in integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures and operations of the companies; failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases; difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with the company's existing product lines; difficulty in coordinating, establishing or expanding sales, distribution and marketing functions, as necessary; difficulty in training the global sales team to sell the acquired products; failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies; disruption of the company's ongoing business and diversion of management's attention to transition or integration issues; unanticipated and unknown liabilities; the loss of key employees, customers, partners and channel partners of the company or of the acquired company, resulting in the loss of key information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs; and difficulties implementing and maintaining sufficient controls, policies and procedures over the systems, products and processes of the acquired company. if the company does not achieve the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by the company's management and financial or industry analysts, there could be a material, adverse effect on the company's stock price, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
in addition, for companies acquired, limited experience will exist for several quarters following the acquisition relating to how the acquired company's sales pipelines will convert into sales or revenues, and the conversion rate post-acquisition may be quite different than the historical conversion rate. because a substantial portion of the company's sales are completed in the latter part of a quarter, and its cost structure is largely fixed in the short-term, revenue shortfalls may have a negative impact on the company's profitability. a delay in a small number of large, new software license transactions could cause the company's quarterly software license revenues to fall significantly short of its predictions.
the company may periodically be involved in business combinations with enterprises that are developmental in nature. while these entities have leading-edge technology, they may not have developed direct or indirect distribution channels and may not have software revenues which cover the ongoing expenses. therefore, the company may have a decrease in operating margin and profitability while these types of acquisitions are integrated and the distribution channel incorporates the new product offerings.
disruption of operations or infrastructure failures. a significant portion of the company's software development personnel, source code and computer equipment is located at operating facilities in the united states, canada, india, japan and throughout europe. the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unforeseen catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in the company's operations, services and product development activities. additionally, if the company experiences problems that impair its business infrastructure, such as a computer virus, telephone system failure or an intentional disruption of its information technology systems by a third party, these interruptions could have a material, adverse effect on the company's business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines. further, because the company's sales are not generally linear during any quarterly period, the potential adverse effects resulting from any of the events described above or any other disruption of the company's business could be accentuated if it occurs close to the end of a fiscal quarter.
risks associated with significant sales to existing customers. a significant portion of the company's sales includes follow-on sales to existing customers that invest in the company's broad suite of engineering simulation software and services. if a significant number of current customers were to become dissatisfied with the company's products and services, or choose to license or utilize competitive offerings, the company's follow-on sales, and recurring lease and maintenance revenues, could be materially, adversely impacted, resulting in reduced revenue, operating margins, net income and cash flows.
periodic reorganization of sales force. the company relies heavily on its direct sales force. from time to time, the company reorganizes and makes adjustments to its sales leadership and/or its sales force in response to such factors as management changes, performance issues, market opportunities and other considerations. these changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenue in future quarters. there can be no assurance that the company will not restructure its sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur.
income tax estimates. the company makes significant estimates in determining its worldwide income tax provision. these estimates involve complex tax regulations in a number of jurisdictions across the company's global operations and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. the final outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals. such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made.
the amount of income tax paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. these audits can result in additional assessments, including interest and penalties. the company's estimate for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the company's estimated tax liabilities, including estimates for uncertain tax positions, in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. as a result, the company's effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis.
the company allocates a portion of its purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets. impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax-deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded. the company has recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes. these deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded. any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced, and could have a material impact on the company's effective tax rate during that period.
regulatory compliance. like all other public companies, the company is subject to the rules and regulations of the sec, including those that require the company to report on and receive an attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm regarding the company's internal control over financial reporting. compliance with these requirements causes the company to incur additional expenses and causes management to divert time from the day-to-day operations of the company. while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements, if it is not able to comply with the reporting or attestation requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting, the company may be subject to sanctions by the sec or nasdaq. such sanctions could divert the attention of the company's management from implementing its business plan and could have an adverse effect on the company's business and results of operations.
as the company's stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market, the company is subject to the ongoing financial and corporate governance requirements of nasdaq. while the company anticipates being able to fully comply with these requirements, if it is not able to comply, the company's name may be published on nasdaq's daily non-compliant companies list until nasdaq determines that it has regained compliance or the company no longer trades on nasdaq. if the company were unable to return to compliance with the governance requirements of nasdaq, the company may be delisted from the nasdaq global select market, which could have an adverse effect on the market value of the company's equity securities and the ability to raise additional capital.
governmental revenue sources. the company's sales to the united states government must comply with federal acquisition regulations. failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties being assessed against the company or an order preventing the company from making future sales to the united states government. further, the company's international activities must comply with the export control laws of the united states and other countries, the foreign corrupt practices act, the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 and a variety of other laws and regulations of the united states and other countries in which the company operates. failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
in certain circumstances, the united states government, state and local governments and their respective agencies, and certain foreign governments may have the right to terminate contractual arrangements at any time, without cause. the united states, european union and certain other government contracts, as well as the company's state and local level contracts, are subject to the approval of appropriations or funding authorizations. certain of these contracts permit the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including, but not limited to, termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business, any of which could have an adverse effect on the company's results of operations and cash flows.
contingencies. the company is subject to various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits, alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters. each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could materially affect the company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
changes in existing financial accounting standards. changes in existing accounting rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements, or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements could have a significant, adverse effect on the company's results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business.
in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09). asu 2014-09, effective for annual periods beginning after december 15, 2017, supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. the company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of this update will have on its financial results upon adoption. this update will impact the timing and amounts of revenue recognized, including a potential impact on transactions completed prior to adoption, which could have a significant, adverse impact on the company's results of operations.
in addition, the company could incur significant costs for changes to its business systems, processes and internal controls as a result of the transition. these costs could have a significant, adverse impact on the company's results of operations and cash flows. the transition could also cause management to divert time from the day-to-day operations of the company, which could impact the company's business. if the company is unable to successfully transition its business systems, processes and internal controls before the guidance effective date, it could impact the ability to meet financial reporting deadlines.
changes in tax law. the company's operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which the company does business, including an increase in tax rates, an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which the company has significant deferred tax assets, could result in a material increase in tax expense. currently, a substantial portion of the company's revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states, and a substantial portion of assets are located outside the united states. united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for non-united states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. changes in existing taxation rules or practices, new taxation rules, or varying interpretations of current taxation practices could have a material, adverse effect on the company's results of operations or the manner in which the company conducts its business.
an indian subsidiary of the company received a formal inquiry after a service tax audit was held in 2011. the company could incur tax charges and related liabilities, including those related to the service tax audit case, of approximately $6 million. the service tax issues raised in the company's notice are very similar to the case, m/s microsoft corporation (i) (p) ltd. vs commissioner of service tax, new delhi, wherein the delhi customs, excise and service tax appellate tribunal (cestat) has passed a ruling favorable to microsoft. the company can provide no assurances on whether the microsoft case's favorable ruling will be challenged in higher courts or on the impact that the present microsoft case's decision will have on the company's audit case. the company is uncertain as to when the service tax audit will be completed.
other court cases are pending in india that could have a material impact on the company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows if the ultimate outcome of those cases is similarly inconsistent with tax positions taken by the company.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ansys, inc.'s results for the year ended december 31, 2015 reflect growth in revenue of 0.7%, operating income of 1.8% and diluted earnings per share of 2.2% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the company experienced higher revenue in 2015 due to growth in maintenance revenue, partially offset by decreased perpetual license revenue.
the company's non-gaap results for the year ended december 31, 2015 reflect increased revenue of 0.3%, decreased operating income of 0.8% and decreased diluted earnings per share of 0.3% as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the non-gaap results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustment to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. for further disclosure regarding non-gaap results, see the section titled "non-gaap results" preceding the section titled "liquidity and capital resources".

ansys develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers and students across a broad spectrum of industries and academia, including aerospace and defense, automotive, industrial equipment, electronics, biomedical, energy, materials and chemical processing, and semiconductors. headquartered south of pittsburgh, pennsylvania, the company employed approximately 2,800 people as of december 31, 2015. ansys focuses on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs directly on the desktop, providing a common platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to final-stage testing and validation. the company distributes its ansys suite of simulation technologies through a global network of independent channel partners and direct sales offices in strategic, global locations. it is the company's intention to continue to maintain this hybrid sales and distribution model.
the company licenses its technology to businesses, educational institutions and governmental agencies. growth in the company's revenue is affected by the strength of global economies, general business conditions, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer budgetary constraints and the competitive position of the company's products. please see the sub-sections entitled "global economic conditions", "decline in customers' businesses", "risks associated with international activities", "rapidly changing technology; new products; risk of product errors" and "competition" under item 1a. risk factors for a complete discussion of how these factors might impact the company's financial condition and operating results. the company believes that the features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products are as strong as they have ever been. however, the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles. these long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. the company makes many operational and strategic decisions based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts that are impacted not only by these long sales cycles, but also by current global economic conditions. as a result, the company believes that its overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results. please see the sub-section entitled "sales forecasts" under item 1a. risk factors for a complete discussion of the potential impact of the company's sales forecasts on the company's financial condition, cash flows and operating results.
the company's management considers the competition and price pressure that it faces in the short- and long-term by focusing on expanding the breadth, depth, ease of use and quality of the technologies, features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of its software products as compared to its competitors; investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increase the capabilities of its existing products; supplying new products and services; focusing on customer needs, training, consulting and support; and enhancing its distribution channels. from time to time, the company also considers acquisitions to supplement its global engineering talent, product offerings and distribution channels.
geographic trends the following table presents the company's geographic constant currency revenue growth during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014:
in north america, the company experienced strong performance in the electronics, high-tech, aerospace and defense, and automotive industries as companies continued to rely on ansys technology to meet the needs of energy and fuel efficiency, safety and comfort, and the cost-effective delivery of more innovative products in the face of evolving competition and customer requirements. the impact of low oil prices continued to negatively impact north american energy and energy-related customers as they held back on investments, reduced their workforce and considered consolidation and realignment. sales hiring, sales pipeline building and customer engagement activities in north america remained strong as demand for innovation continued to drive simulation investments across a broad array of industries.
europe continued to show progress, but with mixed results and pockets of lingering economic and geopolitical issues. germany continued to lead the region, which also experienced growth and steady progress in countries such as italy and the netherlands. however, the company's performance in europe continued to be adversely impacted as a result of weakness in markets such as france and russia. the company experienced comparable industry trends to those in north america, particularly within the automotive industry. sales hiring and sales pipeline building activities continued to be major areas of focus.
the results in the general international area, which primarily consists of the asia-pacific region, continued to demonstrate progress in japan and india. the growth was adversely impacted by performance in brazil. additionally, business momentum in the chinese state-owned enterprises was slower throughout 2015. throughout the region, the company experienced strength in the aerospace and defense, and high-tech industries. in the industrial equipment industry, continued focus on power generation had a positive impact. the company continued to focus on improving direct sales execution and the new business production of the channel partner network.

the company's revenue increased 0.7% during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the growth rate was adversely impacted by 7.0% due to a strengthening u.s. dollar and would have been 7.8% at currency exchange rates that were in effect for 2014. the growth rate was favorably impacted by the company's continued investment in its global sales, support and marketing organizations. annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 5.2%. this growth was primarily due to maintenance contracts sold with electronics products. perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, decreased 3.1% as compared to the prior year. while lease licenses, perpetual licenses and service revenue declined as compared to the prior year, all were higher in constant currency.
with respect to revenue, on average for the year ended december 31, 2015, the u.s. dollar was 12.5% stronger, when measured against the company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended december 31, 2014. the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of $65.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the impact on revenue was primarily driven by $42.7 million, $14.6 million, $2.9 million and $2.9 million of adverse impact due to a weakening euro, japanese yen, south korean won and british pound, respectively. the net overall strengthening of the u.s. dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of $38.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014.
a substantial portion of the company's license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts. these contracts are generally renewed on an annual basis and typically have a high rate of customer renewal. in addition to the recurring revenue base associated with these contracts, a majority of customers purchasing new perpetual licenses also purchase related annual maintenance contracts. as a result of the significant recurring revenue base, the company's license and maintenance revenue growth rate in any period does not necessarily correlate to the growth rate of new license and maintenance contracts sold during that period. to the extent the rate of customer renewal for lease and maintenance contracts is high, incremental lease contracts, and maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses, will result in license and maintenance revenue growth in constant currency. conversely, if the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, the company's license and maintenance growth will be adversely affected over the term that the revenue for those contracts would have otherwise been recognized.
the company is starting to experience an increased interest by its customers in enterprise license agreements that often include longer-term, time-based licenses involving a larger number of the company's software products. while these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price, the revenue from these contracts is typically deferred and recognized over the period of the contract, resulting in increased deferred revenue and backlog. to the extent these types of contracts replace sales of perpetual licenses, there could be a near-term adverse impact on software license and maintenance revenue growth.
international and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 62.4% and 37.6%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2015, and 65.8% and 34.2%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2014. the company derived 24.2% and 24.9% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the company's recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. as a result, the company's post-acquisition revenue will be
less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $1.7 million.

software licenses: the net decrease in costs of software licenses was primarily due to the following:
•   decreased stock-based compensation of $1.0 million.
•   cost reduction from foreign exchange translation of $0.9 million.
•   decreased salaries and incentive compensation of $0.9 million.
•   increased spaceclaim-related costs of software licenses of $0.6 million, primarily as a result of twelve months of spaceclaim activity in the current year as compared to eight months of activity in the prior year.
•   increased facilities and it-related maintenance of $0.4 million.
•   increased third-party royalties of $0.2 million.
amortization: the net increase in amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of trade names, partially offset by a cost reduction related to foreign exchange translation.
maintenance and service: the net decrease in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:
•   cost reduction related to foreign exchange translation of $7.6 million.
•   increased salaries and severance costs, each of $0.7 million.
•   increased third-party technical support costs of $0.6 million.
the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue and decrease in related cost of sales.

•   increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $18.4 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.
•   increased third-party commissions of $1.7 million.
•   increased business travel and meals of $1.6 million.
•   increased consulting costs of $1.4 million.
•   increased office lease and utility costs of $1.0 million.
•   cost reduction due to foreign exchange translation of $13.2 million.
•   decreased severance costs of $3.1 million.
the company anticipates that it will continue to make targeted investments in its global sales and marketing organizations and its global business infrastructure to enhance and support its revenue-generating activities.
research and development: the net increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries and other headcount-related costs of $7.5 million.
•   increased spaceclaim-related research and development costs of $1.8 million, primarily as a result of twelve months of spaceclaim activity in the current year as compared to eight months of activity in the prior year.
•   increased office lease and utility costs of $0.6 million.
•   increased facilities and it-related maintenance of $0.6 million.
•   cost reduction due to foreign exchange translation of $5.4 million.
•   decreased stock-based compensation of $1.8 million.
the company has traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intends to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of its broad portfolio of simulation software products. more specifically, this includes the evolution of its ansys workbench platform, expansion of high-performance computing capabilities, ansys aim immersive user interface, offerings on ansys enterprise cloud, robust design and ongoing integration of acquired technology.
amortization: the decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in the amortization of acquired customer lists and a cost reduction related to foreign exchange translation.
other income (expense), net: the company's other income (expense) consists of the following:
income tax provision: the company recorded income tax expense of $104.2 million and had income before income taxes of $356.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, representing an effective tax rate of 29.2%. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company recorded income tax expense of $93.4 million and had income before income taxes of $348.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 26.8%.
the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to a decrease in benefits related to legal entity restructuring activities. when compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate, the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 were favorably impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction, research and development credits and tax benefits associated with the merger of the company's japan subsidiaries in 2010. the quarterly benefit of approximately $3.1 million associated with the merger of the company's japan subsidiaries was fully amortized in the third quarter of 2015. there will be no additional ongoing benefit from this transaction. the rates were also favorably impacted by the recurring item of lower statutory tax rates in many of the company's foreign jurisdictions.
net income: the company's net income for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $252.5 million as compared to net income of $254.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. diluted earnings per share was $2.76 for the year ended december 31, 2015 and $2.70 for the year ended december 31, 2014. the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 91.5 million and 94.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

the company's revenue increased 8.7% during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013, including increases in all major revenue categories. the growth rate was adversely impacted by 0.9% due to a strengthening u.s. dollar and would have been 9.6% at currency exchange rates that were in effect for 2013. the growth rate was favorably impacted by the company's continued investment in its global sales and marketing organizations. revenue from lease licenses increased 6.8% as compared to the prior year due primarily to growth in lease license revenue of power analysis and electronics products. perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales, increased 6.6% as compared to the prior year. annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, along with maintenance contracts sold with new perpetual licenses in previous years, contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 12.2%.
with respect to revenue, on average for the year ended december 31, 2014, the u.s. dollar was 1.6% stronger, when measured against the company's primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended december 31, 2013. the net overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue of $7.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013. the impact on revenue was primarily driven by $9.8 million of adverse impact due to a weakening japanese yen, partially offset by $1.9 million of favorable impact due to a strengthening british pound. the net overall strengthening of the u.s. dollar also resulted in decreased operating income of $5.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2013.
international and domestic revenues, as a percentage of total revenue, were 65.8% and 34.2%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2014, and 66.1% and 33.9%, respectively, during the year ended december 31, 2013. the company derived 24.9% and 25.3% of its total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
in valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of the company's recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, the company applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to its historical carrying amount. as a result, the company's post-acquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by ansys and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. the impact on reported revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $5.4 million.

software licenses: the increase in costs of software licenses was primarily due to the following:
•   increased costs of software licenses of $0.8 million due to the acquisition of spaceclaim for the period from the acquisition date (april 30, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased salaries of $0.6 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.
amortization: the net decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a net decrease in the amortization of acquired technology, partially offset by an increase in trade name amortization.
maintenance and service: the increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries of $3.3 million.
•   increased third-party technical support of $1.1 million.
the improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue offset by a smaller increase in related cost of sales.

•   increased salaries, incentive compensation and other headcount-related costs of $11.0 million, primarily due to an increase in headcount.
•   increased selling, general and administrative costs of $4.6 million due to the acquisition of spaceclaim for the period from the acquisition date (april 30, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased severance costs of $3.3 million.
•   increased selling, general and administrative costs of $2.4 million due to the acquisition of reaction design for the period from the acquisition date (january 3, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased third-party commissions of $2.1 million.
research and development: the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following:
•   increased salaries and other headcount-related costs of $6.1 million.
•   increased research and development costs of $2.3 million due to the acquisition of spaceclaim for the period from the acquisition date (april 30, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased research and development costs of $2.3 million due to the acquisition of reaction design for the period from the acquisition date (january 3, 2014) through december 31, 2014.
•   increased stock-based compensation of $1.2 million.
amortization: the net increase in amortization expense was primarily due to a net increase in the amortization of customer lists, partially offset by a net decrease in the amortization of contract backlog.
interest expense: the company's interest expense consists of the following:
amortization of debt financing costs           -                     149
other expense, net: the company's other expense consists of the following:
income tax provision: the company recorded income tax expense of $93.4 million and had income before income taxes of $348.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, representing an effective tax rate of 26.8%. during the year ended december 31, 2013, the company recorded income tax expense of $77.2 million and had income before income taxes of $322.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 23.9%.
in december 2013, the company received notice from the irs that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the company's tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010. an $11.0 million tax benefit was recognized in the company's 2013 financial results as the company had effectively settled uncertainty regarding the realization of refund claims filed in connection with the 2009 and 2010 returns.
in the u.s., which is the largest jurisdiction where the company receives such a tax credit, the availability of the research and development credit expired at the end of the 2011 tax year. in january 2013, the u.s. congress passed legislation that reinstated the research and development credit retroactive to 2012. the income tax provision for the year ended december 31, 2013 includes approximately $2.3 million related to the reinstated research and development credit for 2012 activity. the research and development credit also expired at the end of the 2013 tax year, but the u.s. congress reinstated the credit in december 2014 for the 2014 tax year.
the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the release of an uncertain tax position and the reinstatement of the u.s. research and development credit mentioned above impacting the prior year rate.
net income: the company's net income for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $254.7 million as compared to net income of $245.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. diluted earnings per share was $2.70 for the year ended december 31, 2014 and $2.58 for the year ended december 31, 2013. the weighted average shares used in computing diluted earnings per share were 94.2 million and 95.1 million for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
non-gaap results the company provides non-gaap revenue, non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share as supplemental measures to gaap regarding the company's operational performance. these financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with gaap. a detailed explanation and a reconciliation of each non-gaap financial measure to its most comparable gaap financial measure are described below.

note: the 2013 gaap and non-gaap net income and earnings per share data reflected above include $11.0 million of incremental tax benefits, or $0.12 per diluted share, related to the notification received from the irs that the joint committee on taxation took no exception to the company's tax returns that were filed for 2009 and 2010, thus effectively settling the uncertainty regarding refund claims filed in connection with those returns.
non-gaap measures management uses non-gaap financial measures (a) to evaluate the company's historical and prospective financial performance as well as its performance relative to its competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and its employees. in addition, many financial analysts that follow the company focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-gaap financial measures. the company believes that it is in the best interest of its investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-gaap financial information. moreover, investors have historically requested and the company has historically reported these non-gaap financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.
while management believes that these non-gaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-gaap financial measures. these non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap, are not reported by all of the company's competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of the company's competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. the company compensates for these limitations by using these non-gaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measures.
the adjustments to these non-gaap financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:
acquisition accounting for deferred revenue and its related tax impact. historically, the company has consummated acquisitions in order to support its strategic and other business objectives. in accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on the company's business or cash flow, it adversely impacts the company's reported gaap revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. in order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, the company provides non-gaap financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. the company believes that this non-gaap financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past and future reports of financial results of the company as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related annual lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.
amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions and its related tax impact. the company incurs amortization of intangible assets, included in its gaap presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions it has made. management excludes these expenses and their related tax impact for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. accordingly, management does not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating the performance of the company during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and it excludes such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare past reports of financial results of the company as the company has historically reported these non-gaap financial measures.
stock-based compensation expense and its related tax impact. the company incurs expense related to stock-based compensation included in its gaap presentation of cost of software licenses; cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. although stock-based compensation is an expense of the company and viewed as a form of compensation, management excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company. specifically, the company excludes stock-based compensation during its annual budgeting process and its quarterly and annual assessments of the company's and management's performance. the annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby the company allocates resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. additionally, the annual review by the board of directors during which it compares the company's historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. in evaluating the performance of senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. in fact, the company records stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. in this way, management is able to review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
transaction costs related to business combinations. the company incurs expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in its gaap presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. these expenses are generally not tax-deductible. management excludes these acquisition-related transaction expenses for the purpose of calculating non-gaap operating income, non-gaap operating profit margin, non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted earnings per share when it evaluates the continuing operational performance of the company, as it generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of its continuing operations. the company believes that these non-gaap financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the company's operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by management to review the company's operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in the company's financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.
non-gaap financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, gaap. the company's non-gaap financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap.
the company has provided a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures as listed below:
gaap reporting measure       non-gaap reporting measure revenue                      non-gaap revenue operating income             non-gaap operating income operating profit margin      non-gaap operating profit margin net income                   non-gaap net income diluted earnings per share   non-gaap diluted earnings per share
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31,   change
working capital                                            $592,280                $617,240        $(24,960      )        (4.0   )
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market mutual funds and deposits held at major banks. short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain foreign subsidiaries of the company with original maturities of three months to one year. the following table presents the company's foreign and domestic holdings of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments:
as of december 31,
(in thousands, except percentages)              2015        % of total   2014                       % of total domestic                                $539,031                  68.7          $556,328                  70.5
if the foreign balances were repatriated to the u.s., they would be subject to domestic tax, resulting in a tax obligation in the period of repatriation. in general, it is the practice and intention of the company to repatriate previously taxed earnings and to reinvest all other earnings of its non-u.s. subsidiaries. the amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the company's consolidated balance sheet.
cash flows from operating activities year ended december 31,   change
net cash provided by operating activities          $367,523                $385,307                $332,983        $(17,784      )             $52,324
net cash provided by operating activities decreased during the current fiscal year due to decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $18.2 million, primarily due to a $26.8 million refund received in 2014 related to the company's 2009 and 2010 federal income tax years.
net cash provided by operating activities increased during the prior fiscal year due to increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $38.1 million, including the aforementioned $26.8 million tax refund, and increased net income (net of non-cash operating adjustments) of $14.2 million.
cash flows from investing activities year ended december 31,                                                                                change
net cash used in investing activities decreased during the current fiscal year due primarily to decreased acquisition-related net cash outlays of $56.9 million and decreased capital expenditures of $9.9 million. the company currently plans capital spending of $20 million to $25 million during fiscal year 2016 as compared to the $16.1 million that was spent in 2015. the level of spending will be dependent upon various factors, including growth of the business and general economic conditions.
net cash used in investing activities increased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased acquisition-related net cash outlays of $98.8 million related to the acquisitions of spaceclaim and reaction design, partially offset by decreased capital spending of $2.8 million.

net cash used in financing activities increased during the current fiscal year due primarily to increased stock repurchases of $104.1 million.
net cash used in financing activities increased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased stock repurchases of $117.7 million, partially offset by decreased principal payments on long-term debt of $53.1 million. the company paid the outstanding balance of its term loan at maturity on july 31, 2013.
other cash flow information during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015, the company completed various acquisitions to accelerate the development of new and innovative products to the marketplace while lowering design and engineering costs for customers. the acquisitions were not individually significant. the combined purchase price of the acquisitions was approximately $49.7 million, which included cash and equity. the operating results of each acquisition have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements since each respective date of acquisition.
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of $784.2 million, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet the company's working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months. the company's cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings. there can be no assurance that such financings can be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.
under the company's stock repurchase program, the company repurchased shares as follows:
number of shares repurchased                  3,833                   2,977                   1,494
in february 2016, the company's board of directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase to a total of 5.0 million shares under the stock repurchase program. as of december 31, 2015, 2.1 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program.
the company continues to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believes that the best uses of its excess cash are to invest in the business and repurchase stock in order to both offset dilution and return capital, in excess of its requirements, to stockholders with the goal of increasing stockholder value. additionally, the company has in the past, and expects in the future, to acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, services and technologies. any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, credit facilities, or the issuance of additional securities.
off-balance-sheet arrangements the company does not have any special-purpose entities or off-balance-sheet financing.
contractual obligations the company's significant contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015 are summarized below:
(in thousands)                                                                                      total            within 1 year           2 - 3 years           4 - 5 years       after 5 years global headquarters operating lease(1)                                                        $45,137                $4,278                 $8,556                $8,742             $23,561
other operating leases(2)                                                                      32,692                11,017                 12,254                 5,974             3,447
(1)   on september 14, 2012, the company entered into a lease agreement for 186,000 square feet of rentable space located in an office facility in canonsburg, pennsylvania, which serves as the company's headquarters. the lease was effective as of september 14, 2012, but because the leased premises were under construction, the company was not obligated to pay rent until three months following the date that the leased premises were delivered to ansys, which occurred on october 1, 2014. the term of the lease is 183 months, beginning on october 1, 2014. the company has a one-time right to terminate the lease effective upon the last day of the tenth full year following the date of possession (december 31, 2024), by providing the landlord with at least 18 months' prior written notice of such termination.
(2)   other operating leases primarily include noncancellable lease commitments for the company's other domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment.
(3)   unconditional purchase obligations primarily include software licenses and long-term purchase contracts for network, communication and office maintenance services, which are unrecorded as of december 31, 2015.
(4)   the company has $17.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, that have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with income tax accounting guidance for which the company is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. as a result, such amounts are excluded from the table above.
(5)   other long-term obligations primarily include deferred compensation of $13.1 million (including estimated imputed interest of $290,000 within 1 year and $250,000 within 2-3 years) and pension obligations of $6.2 million for certain foreign locations of the company.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition:  revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts. revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys, provided that acceptance has occurred and a signed contractual obligation has been received, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectibility of the receivable is probable. the company determines the fair value of post-contract customer support ("pcs") sold together with perpetual licenses based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately. revenue from pcs contracts is classified as maintenance and service revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
revenue for software lease licenses is classified as license revenue and is recognized over the period of the lease contract. typically, the company's software leases include pcs which, due to the short term (principally one year or less) of the company's software lease licenses, cannot be separated from lease revenue for accounting purposes. as a result, both the lease licenses and pcs are recognized ratably over the lease period. due to the short-term nature of the software lease licenses and the frequency with which the company provides major product upgrades (typically every 12-18 months), the company does not believe that a significant portion of the fee paid under the arrangement is attributable to the pcs component of the arrangement and, as a result, includes the revenue for the entire arrangement within software license revenue in the consolidated statements of income.
many of the company's semiconductor products are typically licensed via longer term leases of 24-36 months. the company recognizes revenue for these licenses over the term of the lease contract. because the company does not have vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value of these leases, the company also recognizes revenue from perpetual licenses over the term of the lease contract during the infrequent occurrence of these licenses being sold with semiconductor leases in multiple-element arrangements.
revenue from training, support and other services is recognized as the services are performed. the company applies the specific performance method to contracts in which the service consists of a single act, such as providing a training class to a customer, and the proportional performance method to other service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple acts (for example, both training and consulting). in applying the proportional performance method, the company typically utilizes output-based estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials, and estimates output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract. input-based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials, utilizing direct labor as the input measure.
the company also executes arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute the company's software products to end users of the company's products and services in specified territories. in sales facilitated by channel partners, the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end-user customer. the company recognizes revenue from transactions with channel partners when the channel partner submits a written purchase commitment, collectibility from the channel partner is probable, a license agreement signed by the end-user customer is received and delivery has occurred, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to the company by the channel partners. this amount includes a fee for pcs that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user, which is based on the rate charged for pcs when sold separately, and is recognized over the period that pcs is to be provided. the company does not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of its channel partners.
non-income related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses. the collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses.
the company warrants to its customers that its software will substantially perform as specified in the company's most current user manuals. the company has not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support, which the company is already obligated to provide. consequently, the company has not established reserves for warranty obligations.
the company's agreements with its customers generally require it to indemnify the customer against claims that the company's software infringes third-party patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights. such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry-standard respects, including the company's right to replace an infringing product. as of december 31, 2015, the company had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims with respect thereto were outstanding. the company does not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations, and, consequently, the company has not established any related reserves.
allowance for doubtful accounts:  the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful. provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices from both value and delinquency perspectives. for those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates based upon the age of the receivable and the geographic area of origin. in determining these percentages, the company considers its historical collection experience and current economic trends in the customer's industry and geographic region. if the historical data used to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected.
income taxes: the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.
the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. in making such determination, the company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. in the event the company determines that it will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value, the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes.
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more-likely-than-not threshold. otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income. accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: the company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount. goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level. this requires the company to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested, including business plans, anticipated future cash flows, economic projections and other market data. because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors, significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact the company's future financial results. during the first quarter of 2015, the company completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date, january 1, 2015. the company tested a previously unamortized trade name that was determined to have a finite life for impairment during the first quarter of 2015 and determined that its fair value exceeded its carrying value, so no impairment was recorded. no other events or circumstances changed during the twelve months ended december 31, 2015 that would indicate that the fair values of the company's reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset are below their carrying values.
contingencies: the company is involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits, alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters. the company reviews the status of these matters, assesses its financial exposure and records a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation, claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. as a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates, the company may have to revise its estimates as facts and circumstances change. the revision of these estimates could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations.
stock-based compensation: the company grants options and other stock awards to employees and directors under the company's stock option and grant plan. eligible employees can also purchase shares of the company's common stock at a discount under the company's employee stock purchase plan. the benefits provided under these plans are share-based payments subject to the provisions of share-based payment accounting guidance. the company uses the fair value method to apply the provisions of share-based payment accounting guidance. stock-based compensation expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $34.0 million, $36.9 million and $35.3 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to unvested stock options and awards granted prior to that date was $52.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.
the value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant, or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination, using the black-scholes option pricing model ("black-scholes model"). the determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by the company's stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. these variables include the company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. the table below presents the weighted average input assumptions used and resulting fair values for options granted or issued in business combinations during each respective year. the stock-based compensation expense for options is recorded ratably over the requisite service period. the interest rate assumptions were determined by using the five-year u.s. treasury note yield on the date of grant or date of acquisition.
risk-free interest rate                      1.18% to 1.65%          1.49% to 1.76%          0.68% to 1.48%

the company issues various restricted stock awards which contain a market condition, a performance condition, a service condition, or any combination of the three. restricted stock awards are valued based on the grant-date fair value of the award. stock compensation expense is recognized over the employee's requisite service period for awards with only a service condition. for awards with a performance condition, stock-based compensation expense is recorded from the service inception date through the conclusion of the measurement period based on management's estimates concerning the probability of vesting.
vesting of restricted stock awards with a market condition is based on the company's performance as measured by total shareholder return relative to the median percentage appreciation of a specified stock index over the measurement period, subject to each participant's continued employment with the company through the conclusion of the measurement period. the fair value of the restricted stock awards with a market condition is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model. the determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and a number of variables, each of which has been identified in the chart below for awards granted during each respective period. share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is being recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period.
risk-free interest rate                                      1.1%               0.7%               0.4%
expected volatility-ansys stock price                         23%                25%                25%
expected volatility-nasdaq composite index                    14%                15%                20%
expected term                                           2.8 years          2.8 years          2.8 years correlation factor                                           0.60               0.70               0.70
the company also grants deferred stock units to non-affiliate independent directors, which are rights to receive shares of common stock upon termination of service as a director. the deferred stock units are issued in arrears and vest immediately.
to the extent the company changes the terms of its stock-based compensation programs, experiences market volatility in the pricing of its common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the black-scholes model, refines different
assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from current estimates, or assumes stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than the company's stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods.
estimates of stock-based compensation expense are significant to the company's financial statements, but this expense is based on the aforementioned option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by the company. for this reason, and because the company does not view stock-based compensation as related to its operational performance, the board of directors and management exclude stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the company's underlying business performance.

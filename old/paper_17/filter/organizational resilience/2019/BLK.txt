item 1a. risk factors as a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of blackrock's business. global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. while blackrock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, fiduciary and investment risks, blackrock's business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the company's stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.
market and competition risks changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets may cause assets under management ("aum"), revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of aum and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests, could cause:
•   the value of aum, or the returns blackrock realizes on aum, to decrease;
•   the withdrawal of funds from blackrock's products in favor of products offered by competitors;
•   the rebalancing or reallocating of assets into blackrock products that yield lower fees;
•   an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•   a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.
the occurrence of any of these events may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
changes in interest or foreign exchange rates and/or divergent beta may cause blackrock's aum and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the company's net income and operating cash flows.
in recent years, there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates, interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates. blackrock's business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. similarly, due to the global nature of blackrock's operations, a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. any failure by blackrock to manage movements in foreign exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar or its exposure to interest rates may cause blackrock's aum to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the company's base fees, net income and operating cash flows.
in addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of blackrock aum weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in blackrock's effective fee rate. divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of aum and base fees.
blackrock's investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.
blackrock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. the advisory or management contracts blackrock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of blackrock's investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove blackrock as a fund's investment advisor (or equivalent). blackrock also manages its us mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds' respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the company. blackrock's fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund's board of directors). in addition, if a number of blackrock's clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove blackrock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest blackrock earns could be reduced, which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
the failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause aum in similar blackrock products to decline irrespective of blackrock's performance.
many competitors offer similar products to those offered by blackrock and the failure or negative performance of competitors' products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar blackrock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
the investment management industry is highly competitive and blackrock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, the level of fees charged, the quality and breadth of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. in addition, the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, have altered the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require blackrock to spend more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with products and services offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
failure to maintain aladdin's competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede blackrock's productivity and growth.
the sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution and investment operations that blackrock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and aladdin clients are important elements of blackrock's competitive success. aladdin's competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform flexibility or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken aladdin's competitive position and may cause the company's revenue and earnings to decline. in addition, to the extent that aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than blackrock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market, lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings, blackrock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share, which may impede its productivity and growth. moreover, although blackrock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in aladdin.
blackrock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose blackrock to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk.
blackrock's financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. conversely, the development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of products with a focus on environmental, social and governance ("esg") matters, requires continued innovative effort on the part of blackrock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. there can be no assurance that blackrock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timescale they require. any failure to develop new products and services, or successfully manage associated operational risks, could harm blackrock's reputation and expose the company to additional costs, which may cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
changes in the value of seed and co-investments that blackrock owns could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.
at december 31, 2019, blackrock's net economic investment exposure of approximately $2.7 billion in its investments (see "item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-investments") primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as other minority investments, increase the volatility of blackrock's earnings and cause earnings to decline.
blackrock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.
blackrock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. in the event of a borrower default, blackrock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client's account. borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower's default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. blackrock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities blackrock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. the amount of securities on loan as of december 31, 2019 and subject to this type of indemnification was $210 billion. in the company's capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $226 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31, 2019. significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the company's revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
while not legally mandated, blackrock may, at its option, from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. losses on such support, as well as regulatory restrictions on the company's ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products, may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
increased geopolitical unrest and other events outside of blackrock's control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
geopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension, european fragmentation, unrest in the middle east, brexit negotiations and terrorist activity, as well as acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. similarly, other events outside of blackrock's control, including natural disasters, pandemics or health crises (such as the coronavirus), may arise from time to time. any such events, and responses thereto, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the company's products, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
risks related to investment performance poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
the company's management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of aum. poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:
•   client withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors;
•   reduced, minimal or no performance fees;
•   an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or
•   a decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investment capital.
performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.
a portion of blackrock's revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. performance fees represented $450 million, or 3%, of total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2019. generally, the company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. if these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the company may not earn performance fees in future periods. the volatility of the company's future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the company's performance fee generating assets. in particular, as blackrock takes on more advisory assignments for illiquid investments, performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products.
failure to identify errors in the quantitative models blackrock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships.
blackrock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions, as well as any failure of blackrock's governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models or model assumptions, could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on blackrock's business and reputation.
technology and operational risks a failure in, or disruption to, blackrock's operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the company's reputation and cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. moreover, a significant portion of blackrock's critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including san francisco, new york, london, budapest and gurgaon. the failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of blackrock's business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside blackrock's control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic, health crisis (such as the coronavirus) or other catastrophic event, or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt blackrock's operations in any location at which blackrock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth.
in addition, despite blackrock's efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the company's ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the company's ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.
a cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm, which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them. an externally caused information security incident, such as a cyber-attack including a phishing scam, malware, or denial-of-service attack, or an internally caused incident, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. moreover, developments in blackrock's use of process automation, as well as the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies, could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond blackrock's control. blackrock's growing exposure to the public internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt blackrock's operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information. in addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available.
there have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information and the unauthorized transfer of customer funds, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including nation state actors and terrorist organizations. blackrock has been the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and must monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt blackrock's operations and cause financial losses. although blackrock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures involving significant expense, to strengthen its computer systems, processes, software, technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective. moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of blackrock's systems, the process of upgrading or patching the company's protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, blackrock's systems.
in addition, due to blackrock's interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, blackrock may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. blackrock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. the company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. however, blackrock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information.
any information security incident or cyber-attack against blackrock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect aladdin operations, which could cause reputational harm, lead to a loss of clients and impede blackrock's productivity and growth.
blackrock must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the aladdin platform. in so doing, it relies in part on certain third-party service providers. for example, aladdin's data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to aladdin's growth. in addition, the analytical capabilities of aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into aladdin's analytical calculations. although blackrock has implemented internal controls and procedures, and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the aladdin platform, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective. any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with aladdin's size and growth, or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities, could compromise aladdin's resilience, result in operational difficulties, cause reputational harm and adversely impact blackrock's ability to provide services to its investment advisory and aladdin clients.
continuing enhancements to aladdin's capabilities, as well as the expansion of the aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in aladdin's processing scale, which may expose blackrock to reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks.
the operation of blackrock's aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, developing, testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements. these updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in aladdin's processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose blackrock to additional cyber- and information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. if blackrock is unable to manage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, blackrock may experience client attrition, reduced business, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
in addition, the highly regulated business activities of many aladdin clients may expose blackrock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. for example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which aladdin clients are based has required blackrock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client's home location. operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose blackrock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions.
failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause blackrock's aum, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.
blackrock's ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force blackrock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. blackrock's access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause blackrock's aum, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.
operating risks associated with blackrock's securities lending program may result in client losses.
blackrock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. in these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. blackrock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. the failure of blackrock's controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the company's clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments), and blackrock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks.
inorganic transactions may harm the company's competitive or financial position if they are not successful.
blackrock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses. inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for blackrock to realize the benefit of such transactions. the success of blackrock's inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. blackrock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. there can be no assurance that blackrock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy. moreover, the challenges associated with blackrock's inorganic strategy may be heightened when acquired businesses are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products or business lines or are delivered via technology that differs from that employed by blackrock. any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions through due diligence, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could have an adverse effect on blackrock's reputation or cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the company's competitive position in the investment management industry.
client investments in real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose blackrock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.
blackrock makes investments on behalf of its clients in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, that may expose blackrock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. these may include:
•   construction risks, including labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;
•   accidents, adverse weather, force majeure or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond blackrock's control;
•   failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;
•   exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;
•   environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;
•   changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;
•   the financial resources of tenants; and
•   contingent liabilities on disposition of assets.
the above risks may expose blackrock's funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by blackrock's clients. these risks could also result in direct liability for blackrock by exposing blackrock to losses, regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which blackrock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of blackrock's clients. the occurrence of any such events may expose blackrock to reputational harm, divert management's attention away from blackrock's other business activities or cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
operating in international markets increases blackrock's operational, political, regulatory and other risks.
as a result of blackrock's extensive international operations, the company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the company's control. operating outside the united states ("us") may also expose blackrock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher compliance costs to comply with us and non-us anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. the failure of the company's systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
risks related to human capital the potential for human error in connection with blackrock's operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the company's reputation and may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
many of blackrock's operations are highly complex and are dependent on the company's ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. although blackrock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the company, blackrock's operations are dependent on its employees. from time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. these can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or report issues, or errors in judgment. human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on blackrock's reputation, which may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
although blackrock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks, it cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks. blackrock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the company's controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on blackrock's reputation, which could cause adverse publicity, regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions and may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
the failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the company's ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within blackrock. the global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect blackrock's ability to attract and retain such employees include the company's reputation and workplace culture, the immigration policies in the jurisdictions in which blackrock has offices, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals.
in addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that blackrock pays to its employees is tied to the company's share price. as such, if blackrock's share price were to decrease, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. if blackrock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the company's ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.
risks related to key third-party relationships the impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that blackrock manages, which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock's investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. transactions with counterparties expose blackrock's clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults.  although blackrock maintains a robust vendor management program and regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations. in addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that blackrock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple blackrock clients.  any such operational issue, impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts that blackrock manages for its clients, which may lead to client attrition and, in turn, cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
the failure of a key vendor to blackrock to fulfill its obligations or a failure by blackrock to maintain its relationships with key vendors could have a material adverse effect on blackrock's growth, reputation or business, which may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market data, market indices, technology and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. blackrock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients' investment decisions. the index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. this industry structure may limit blackrock's ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all. while blackrock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. moreover, in situations where blackrock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of blackrock's arrangement with a
vendor requires a long term-commitment, blackrock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services.
blackrock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one vendor to another. key contract transfers may be costly and complex, and expose blackrock to heightened operational risks. any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to blackrock and its clients. the failure or inability of blackrock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients' investment management agreements, have an adverse financial impact on blackrock products or lead to operational and regulatory issues for the company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain blackrock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. blackrock's ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the company's future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of blackrock products and services being marketed or distributed. moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the company's products and services and fee compression. if blackrock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings may decline. in addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to blackrock.
disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to blackrock's exchange-traded fund ("etf") platform may adversely affect the prices at which etfs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility.
blackrock is the largest provider of etfs globally. shares of etfs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the etf's most recent net asset value. the net asset value of an etf is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the etf's holdings. the trading price of the etf's shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. while an etf's creation/redemption feature and the arbitrage mechanism are designed to make it more likely that the etf's shares normally will trade at prices close to the etf's net asset value, exchange prices may deviate significantly from the etf's net asset value. etf market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, inability or unwillingness of market markers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an etf's arbitrage mechanism to function effectively, or significant market volatility. although blackrock and other large issuers of etfs are working with market participants to seek to enhance us equity market resiliency, there can be no assurance that structural reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion, or at all. moreover, if market events lead to incidences where etfs trade at prices that deviate significantly from an etf's net asset value, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in etf products and redeem their holdings, which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
legal and regulatory risks blackrock is subject to extensive regulation around the world.
blackrock's business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. these regulations subject blackrock's business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex. in addition, many of blackrock's legal entities may be subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the us foreign corrupt practices act, the usa patriot act, the bank secrecy act, the uk bribery act, sanctions imposed by the us treasury's office of foreign assets control, the united nations and the european union ("eu") and its member states, as well as those imposed by other countries in which blackrock operates. blackrock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. furthermore, many jurisdictions in which blackrock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the general data protection regulation, which expands data protection rules for individuals within the eu and for personal data exported outside the eu. any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions against the company, as well as reputational harm. moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if blackrock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the company's financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted.
blackrock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. in particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of blackrock's bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on blackrock's reputation or business and may cause the company's aum, revenue and earnings to decline. for a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which blackrock is subject and regulated by, see "item 1 - business - regulation."
regulatory reforms in the united states expose blackrock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
in recent years a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the united states, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which blackrock is subject has increased. further changes to financial services regulation may arise, including in connection with the executive order issued in february 2017 (the "executive order") directing the us department of the treasury ("treasury") to identify laws, treaties, regulations and other policies that promote or inhibit certain core principles for financial regulation, that may directly or indirectly impact blackrock's business or operating activities. blackrock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. while blackrock is, or may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the united states, see "item 1 - business - regulation," key regulatory reforms that may impact the company include:
•   securities and exchange commission ("sec") rulemakings for us registered funds and investment advisers: the sec and its staff are engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. these efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. the sec has adopted rules that include (i) new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain us registered funds; (ii) enhanced reporting regimes for investment advisers; and (iii) implementing liquidity risk management programs for etfs and open-end funds, other than money market funds. these rules increase, and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the sec's efforts may increase, blackrock's public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede blackrock's growth.
•   sec etf rule: in september 2019, the sec adopted rule 6c-11 under the investment company act of 1940 (the "investment company act") known as the "etf rule". the etf rule will allow etfs that satisfy certain conditions to operate without first obtaining individual exemptive relief from the sec. the etf rule is designed to create a clear and consistent regulatory framework for most etfs operating today and will impact all blackrock etfs registered under the investment company act (including ishares etfs). the etf rule and related form amendments became effective in december 2019. the form amendments will have a transition period of one year following the effective date. in addition, the etf rule rescinds, one year after its effective date, the existing exemptive relief for all eligible etfs (including ishares etfs).
•   standards of conduct rulemaking: in june 2019, the sec adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations addressing investment adviser and broker-dealer standards of conduct. the package includes new rules requiring registered advisers and registered broker-dealers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors, a new rule establishing a standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers, and two new interpretations under the investment advisers act of 1940 (the "advisers act"). the rulemakings and interpretations could increase blackrock's disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between blackrock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for blackrock's distribution partners and limit blackrock's ability to provide certain other services to its clients. the department of labor ("dol") has also indicated it intends to propose a standards of conduct rule in 2020.
•   sec derivatives rule for us registered funds: in november 2019, the sec proposed a rule designed to enhance the regulation of the use of derivatives by registered investment companies, including mutual funds (other than money market funds), etfs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. the proposed rule would permit such funds to use derivatives, such as forwards, futures, swaps and written options, that create future payment obligations, provided that the funds comply with certain conditions including adopting a derivatives risk management program and complying with a limit on the amount of leverage-related risk that a fund may obtain, based on value-at-risk. if adopted without change, the proposed rule would increase blackrock's disclosure and compliance obligations and may impact certain funds' usage of derivatives and investment strategy.
•   sec guidance on proxy voting responsibilities of investment advisors: in august 2019, the sec published guidance to assist investment advisers with their proxy voting responsibilities under the advisers act. the guidance confirmed that investment advisers' fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to their clients apply to proxy voting and encouraged advisors with voting authority to review their policies and procedures in detail and consider whether more analysis may be required under certain circumstances, including when a proxy advisory firm's services are retained. this guidance could impact voting arrangements between blackrock and its clients, and lead to additional compliance, operational and disclosure obligations for blackrock.
•   the volcker rule: provisions of dodd-frank referred to as the "volcker rule" created a new section of the bank holding company act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively "covered funds"). the bank holding company act by its terms does not currently apply to blackrock. the federal reserve has taken the position that pnc's ownership interest in blackrock, which is approximately 22%, in combination with certain other factors, causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for the purpose of the bank holding company act and that blackrock is subject to banking regulation. based on this interpretation of the bank holding company act, the federal reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that pnc controls blackrock under the terms of the bank holding company act. any such determination, if successful, would subject blackrock to current and future regulatory requirements under the bank holding company act, including the volcker rule. conformance with the volcker rule may require blackrock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in its covered funds, which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions.
•   designation as a systemically important financial institution ("sifi"): the financial stability oversight council ("fsoc") has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as sifis. in july 2014, the fsoc pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management. in december 2019, the fsoc re-affirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. this reduces the risk of an entity-level designation, however the fsoc retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. in the event that blackrock is designated as a sifi under dodd-frank, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the federal reserve.
regulatory reforms in the united states could require blackrock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be costly, impede the company's growth and cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline. regulatory reform may also impact blackrock's banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to blackrock.
international regulatory reforms expose blackrock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty.
blackrock's business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the united states and the company may be affected by a number of proposed or fully or partially implemented reform initiatives in emea and the asia-pacific region, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty, including:
•   british exit from the eu: the uk left the eu on january 31, 2020 and entered an eleven-month transition period during which the uk, and uk-based entities, will retain the rights and obligations of eu membership. substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the uk and eu, but the uk government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the eu before the end of the transition period rather than continuing single market or customs union membership. blackrock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including there being no agreement in place when the transition period expires. these steps, many of which are time consuming and costly, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the eu, and engaging in client communications, and are expected to add complexity to blackrock's european operations. in addition, depending on the terms of the future relationship between the uk and the eu, blackrock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its european operations during the transition period and post-brexit, which may impede the company's growth or impact its financial performance.
•   reform of investment markets: in europe, the markets in financial instruments directive ("mifid") governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, "mifid ii"). the regulation's requirements generally apply consistently across the eu. the mifid ii reforms, which came into force in january 2018, are substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the company. new disclosure and reporting obligations have been introduced, together with restrictions on how research may be funded and the nature of payments that may be provided to distributors. mifid ii, together with other market structure reforms, force more derivatives to be traded on-exchange, introduce new commodity derivatives position limits and significantly enhance reporting obligations associated with individual trades. the broad nature of the mifid ii reforms impact blackrock's product development, client servicing and distribution models. in particular, additional disclosures are required to be made in respect of costs and fees blackrock charges to certain of its clients. mifid ii also impacts the ability of certain of blackrock's distribution partners to accept commissions from blackrock for distributing blackrock funds. similar reforms have been introduced in switzerland and australia.
•   revised eu capital requirements for investment firms: in december 2017, the european commission published a proposal for a new directive and regulation on prudential requirements for mifid investment firms. the proposal passed the eu legislative process and the final texts of the regulation and directive were published in december 2019. the new legislative package, which comes into effect in 2021, will result in changes to the amount of regulatory capital blackrock is required to hold in the eu and how such capital is calculated, as well as introduce revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms.
•   eu market access: in 2019, the european commission commenced a review of the alternative investment fund managers directive to assess, among other things, the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes. to the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and eu market access rights for asset management firms with non-eu operations, blackrock's ability to access eu-based clients may be adversely affected.
•   senior managers and certification regime: in the uk, the fca extended the senior managers and certification regime ("smcr") to all financial services firms in december 2019. the regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of uk financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. smcr impacts nearly all staff of the company in the uk, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.
•   uk asset management market study: the fca has adopted requirements for uk fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer "value" to investors. beginning in 2020, the company will be required annually to disclose the conclusions of its assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. if "value" has not been provided to consumers, the company will need to address any identified deficiencies. the fca also requested that the uk's competition and markets authority ("cma") assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. the cma's final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and the uk regulatory regime will be revised in 2020 to introduce mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and new standards of disclosure of fees and performance. the cma's remedies could have a significant impact on the company's ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with uk pension fund clients.
•   eu sustainability regulation: in 2018, the european commission introduced a number of regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investments products, and issuers; and require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors. rules arising from the reform proposals will come into effect beginning in 2021.
•   macroprudential policies for asset managers: certain european policymakers continue to raise concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector. these concerns may lead to macroprudential policy measures being applied to open-ended investment funds broadly, or regulation being introduced that requires changes to the
structural features of certain open-ended investment funds. either eventuality could limit blackrock's ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to blackrock.
international regulatory reforms could require blackrock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, impede the company's growth and cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline. regulatory reform may also impact blackrock's internationally-based clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to blackrock.
blackrock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock's activities. certain of blackrock's subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the securities exchange commission, office of the comptroller of the currency ("occ"), dol, commodity futures trading commission, financial conduct authority and federal reserve. similarly, from time to time, blackrock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various us and non-us governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. these examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. any such action may also result in litigation by investors in blackrock's funds, other blackrock clients or blackrock's shareholders, which could harm the company's reputation and may cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the company being liable for damages.
in addition, when clients retain blackrock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that blackrock must observe in the provision of its services. a failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose blackrock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.
as blackrock's business continues to grow, the company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. in addition, the sec and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts. blackrock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues. however, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the company fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, or penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock is subject to us banking regulations that may limit its business activities.
blackrock's trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the occ, is subject to occ regulation and capital requirements. the occ has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over blackrock's trust bank. being subject to banking regulation may put blackrock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations. in addition, as described in "item 1-business-regulation", as of december 31, 2019, pnc owned approximately 22% of blackrock's capital stock, which may subject blackrock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc. the bank holding company act by its terms does not currently apply to blackrock. the federal reserve has taken the position that this ownership interest, in combination with certain other factors, causes blackrock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of pnc for the purpose of the bank holding company act and that blackrock is subject to banking regulation. based on this interpretation of the bank holding company act, the federal reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that pnc controls blackrock under the terms of the bank holding company act. any such determination, if successful, would subject blackrock to current and future regulatory requirements under the bank holding company act, including the volcker rule, that are more restrictive than those the company is subject to under other applicable laws, as well as the enforcement authority of the federal reserve, which includes the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. any effort by blackrock to contest a control determination by the federal reserve may be costly and complex and may not result in a reversal of such determination.
of note among the various international regulations to which blackrock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the company. the specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. blackrock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. any such errors may expose blackrock to monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on blackrock's reputation and may cause its aum, revenue and earnings to decline.
blackrock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about index investing and common ownership.
as a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, blackrock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as "common ownership". the commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices. additional commentary focuses on competition issues associated with common ownership and purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain concentrated industries managed by asset managers with higher consumer prices and executive compensation, among other things. in the us, the ftc over the course of late 2018 held hearings on competition and consumer protection in the 21st century, one of which included a discussion of common ownership. the hearings may be the subject of a report in 2020. in the eu, the european parliament committee on economic and monetary affairs is expected to publish a report on common ownership, and the european commission may do so in 2020. there is substantial literature highlighting the
benefits of index investing, as well as casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with common ownership arguments. some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on stakes managed by asset managers that, if enacted into policy measures, could have a negative impact on the capital markets, increase transaction costs and limit the availability of products for investors. this may, in turn, adversely affect blackrock.
new tax legislation or changes to existing us and non-us tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to blackrock's historical taxation practices may adversely affect blackrock's effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.
blackrock's businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by us or non-us tax authorities.
in the us, legislation has been proposed in the house and senate to enact a financial transaction tax ("ftt") on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. in the eu, certain member states have also enacted similar ftts and the european commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of eu-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) eu member states. if enacted as proposed, ftts could have an adverse effect on blackrock's financial results and clients' performance results.
the application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business us and non-us tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by blackrock. these challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect blackrock's effective tax rate and overall financial condition. similarly, the company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by blackrock or to specific tax rules. to the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by blackrock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and blackrock may suffer financial or reputational harm.
risks related to blackrock's significant shareholder pnc owns 22% of blackrock's capital stock. future sales or distributions of blackrock's common stock in the public market by the company or pnc could adversely affect the trading price of blackrock's common stock.
as of december 31, 2019, pnc owned 22% of the company's capital stock. sales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of blackrock's common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales or distributions might occur, may cause the market price of blackrock's common stock to decline.
pnc has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock's board of directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of pnc.
as discussed in blackrock's proxy statement, pnc has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of blackrock's board of directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with blackrock. as a consequence, if the shares held by pnc constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determination of the blackrock board of directors. this arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over blackrock in its board of directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the board.
as discussed in blackrock's proxy statement, pursuant to blackrock's stockholder agreement with pnc, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office:
•   appointment of a new chief executive officer of blackrock;
•   any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of blackrock capital stock would be held by persons different than the persons holding such majority of the total voting power prior to the occurrence of any such merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of blackrock;
•   any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of blackrock's consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of blackrock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of blackrock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;
•   any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business blackrock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of blackrock on a consolidated basis;
•   except for repurchases otherwise permitted under the stockholder agreement, any repurchase by blackrock or any subsidiary of shares of blackrock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase blackrock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of blackrock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;
•   any amendment to blackrock's certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or
•   any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the new york stock exchange.
additionally, blackrock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of pnc:
•   any sale of any subsidiary of blackrock, the annualized revenue of which, together with the annualized revenue of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenue of blackrock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;
•   for so long as blackrock is deemed a subsidiary of pnc for purposes of the bank holding company act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the bank holding company act;
•   any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between blackrock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of blackrock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to pnc or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of blackrock capital stock than to pnc;
•   any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of blackrock's certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of pnc or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of blackrock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause pnc or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward-looking statements this report, and other statements that blackrock may make, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act, with respect to blackrock's future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as "trend," "potential," "opportunity," "pipeline," "believe," "comfortable," "expect," "anticipate," "current," "intention," "estimate," "position," "assume," "outlook," "continue," "remain," "maintain," "sustain," "seek," "achieve," and similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could," "may" and similar expressions.

substantial uncertainty remains surrounding the future relationship between the uk and eu, but the uk government has indicated its preference for negotiating a trade deal with the eu before the end of the transition period rather than continuing single market or customs union membership. blackrock is implementing a number of steps to prepare for various outcomes, including there being no agreement in place when the transition period expires. these steps, many of which are time consuming and costly, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving licenses and permissions in the eu, and engaging in client communications, and are expected to add complexity to blackrock's european operations. in addition, depending on the terms of the future relationship between the uk and the eu, blackrock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its european operations during the transition period and post-brexit, which may impede the company's growth or impact its financial performance.
acquisition on may 10, 2019, the company acquired 100% of the equity interests of efront holding sas ("efront transaction" or "efront"), a leading alternative investment management software and solutions provider for approximately $1.3 billion, excluding the settlement of efront's outstanding debt. the acquisition of efront expands aladdin's illiquid alternative capabilities and enables blackrock to provide individual alternative or whole-portfolio technology solutions to clients.
business outlook blackrock's framework for long-term value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. blackrock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning blackrock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management.
blackrock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of aum and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which blackrock invests on behalf of clients, could impact blackrock's aum, revenue and earnings.
blackrock manages $3.8 trillion of equity assets across markets globally. beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of blackrock aum weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in blackrock's effective fee rate. divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of aum and base fees.
blackrock's highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments. blackrock is positioned to provide alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies. in addition, blackrock leverages its world-class risk management, analytics and technology capabilities, including the aladdin platform, on behalf of clients. blackrock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, including investors in ishares etfs, maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus. the diversity of blackrock's platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments, and as client preferences evolve. client demand continues for etfs and illiquid alternatives, which are two areas of focus for blackrock.
the index investing industry has been growing rapidly - with etfs as a major beneficiary - driven by structural tailwinds including the migration from commission-based to fee-based wealth management, clients' focus on value for money, the use of etfs as alpha tools and the growth of all-to-all networked trading. ishares etfs' growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments, including core, strategic, which includes fixed income, factors, sustainable and megatrends etfs, and precision exposures.
as the wealth management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a whole-portfolio approach, blackrock's retail strategy is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions. this includes having a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and alternative products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. digital wealth tools are an important component of blackrock's retail strategy, as blackrock scales and customizes model portfolios, extends aladdin wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally, and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management, powered by aladdin.
blackrock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. in 2019, blackrock completed the acquisition of efront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider. efront, in combination with aladdin, will provide clients with an ability to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform.
across blackrock, more clients are focusing on the impact of sustainability on their portfolios. this shift has been driven by an increased understanding of how sustainability-related factors can affect economic growth, asset values, and financial markets as a whole. as a fiduciary, blackrock is committed to helping clients build more resilient portfolios. since sustainable investment options have the potential to offer clients better outcomes, we are making sustainability integral to the way blackrock manages risk, constructs portfolios, designs products, and engages with companies. over the past several years, blackrock has been deepening the integration of sustainability into technology, risk management, and product choice across blackrock, and plans to accelerate those efforts.

gaap.  operating income of $5,551 million increased $94 million from 2018. operating income growth reflected higher base fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and higher general and administration expense. operating income for 2019 also included $61 million of product launch costs associated with the close of the $1.4 billion blackrock science and technology trust ii, a closed-end active equity fund. operating income for 2018 included a restructuring charge of $60 million from an initiative to modify the size and shape of the workforce. nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests ("nci"), increased $262 million from 2018 driven by higher marks on unhedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain minority investments. nonoperating results for 2018 included a $40 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of the company's minority interest in dsp blackrock investment managers pvt. ltd. to the dsp group ("dsp transaction").
income tax expense for 2019 included $28 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to stock-based compensation awards. income tax expense for 2018 included $145 million of discrete tax benefits, primarily related to changes in the company's organizational entity structure and stock-based compensation awards. see income tax expense within discussion of financial results for more information.
diluted earnings per common share increased $1.85, or 7%, from 2018, reflecting higher operating and nonoperating income, and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the current year.
as adjusted.  operating income of $5,551 million increased $20 million from 2018. in 2018, the pre-tax restructuring charge of $60 million described above has been excluded from as adjusted results. diluted earnings per common share increased $1.55, or 6%, from 2018, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
see non-gaap financial measures for further information on as adjusted items.
for further discussion of blackrock's revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see discussion of financial results herein.
non-gaap financial measures blackrock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap"); however, management believes evaluating the company's ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-gaap financial measures. management reviews non-gaap financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating blackrock's financial performance over time. management also uses non-gaap financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. non-gaap measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of blackrock's revenue and expense. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap. non-gaap measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
management uses both gaap and non-gaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock's financial performance. adjustments to gaap financial measures ("non-gaap adjustments") include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact blackrock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:
(1) operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted:
management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of blackrock's financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the company's long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. the company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the company's financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the company's senior-level employees. furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the company's relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers.
operating income, gaap basis                                       $5,551                 $5,457
non-gaap expense adjustments:
operating income, as adjusted                                       5,551                  5,531
operating income used for operating margin measurement             $5,612                 $5,544
non-gaap adjustments:
revenue used for operating margin measurement                     $12,854                $12,523
operating margin, gaap basis                                         38.2   %               38.4   %
operating margin, as adjusted                                        43.7   %               44.3   %
•   operating income, as adjusted, includes non-gaap expense adjustments. in 2018, a restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of blackrock's ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. in 2018, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans ("ltip") funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of blackrock stock held by pnc has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact blackrock's book value.
•   operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact blackrock's results until future periods.
•   revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the company's distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. for certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. for other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. however, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. the amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of aum during the period. these fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. in addition, the company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.
non-gaap adjustments:
restructuring charge, net of tax                                      -              47
pnc ltip funding obligation, net of tax                               -              12
management believes net income attributable to blackrock, inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of blackrock's profitability and financial performance. net income attributable to blackrock, inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to blackrock, inc., gaap basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact blackrock's book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.
see aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the pnc ltip funding obligation and restructuring charge.
for each period presented, the non-gaap adjustment related to the restructuring charge and pnc ltip funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefits) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.
(3) nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
assets under management aum for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio aum.

(1)   amount represents net aum impact from the tcp transaction, the citibanamex transaction, the aegon transaction and the dsp transaction.
(2)   foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-us dollar denominated aum into us dollars for reporting purposes.
(3)   average aum is calculated as the average of the month-end spot aum amounts for the trailing thirteen months.
aum decreased $312.4 billion to $5.98 trillion at december 31, 2018 from $6.29 trillion at december 31, 2017 driven by net market depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by positive long-term net flows, led by ishares etfs, active multi-asset and illiquid alternatives, and net aum added from strategic transactions.
net market depreciation of $384.1 billion was driven by lower global equity markets.
aum decreased $79.4 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar, largely against the british pound and euro.
discussion of financial results introduction the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company. fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. such fees are affected by changes in aum, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-us dollar denominated aum into us dollars for reporting purposes.
the company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. the securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. generally, the revenue earned is shared between the company and the funds or accounts managed by the company from which the securities are borrowed. historically, securities lending revenue in the second quarter exceeds revenue in the other quarters during the year driven by higher seasonal demand.
investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on aum. investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. as such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of the company's revenue and earnings. the magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on alternative products; however, the third and fourth quarters have a greater number of nonalternative products with performance measurement periods that end on either september 30 or december 31.
the company offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. clients include banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors. fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform, or on a fixed-rate basis.  revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.
the company earns distribution and service fees for distributing investment products and providing support services to investments portfolios. the fees are based on aum and are recognized when the amount of fees is known.
the company advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities across a range of risk, regulatory, capital markets and strategic services. fees earned for advisory services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are determined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over time as the related services are completed.
the company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. commissions related to transition management services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur.
operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.
•   employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs.
•   distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily aum driven, include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain company products.
•   direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expenses incurred by the company related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, and audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. these expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in aum, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.
•   general and administration expense includes marketing and promotional, occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services), technology, professional services, communications, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, the impact of foreign currency remeasurement, and other general and administration expense. foreign currency remeasurement losses were $31 million and $16 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.
approximately 75% of the company's revenue is generated in us dollars. the company's revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the euro and british pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the company's considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the united states.
nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. the company primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real assets. investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including federal reserve bank stock. the company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.
in addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment funds. the portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to the company is allocated to nci on the consolidated statements of income.
revenue the following table presents detail of revenue for 2019 and 2018 and includes the product type mix of investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue (collectively "base fees") and performance fees.

investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $11,777 million in 2019 increased $224 million from $11,553 million in 2018, reflecting the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements, organic growth and acquisitions, partially offset by the negative impact of strategic price changes to certain products. securities lending revenue of $617 million in 2019 compared with $627 million in 2018.
investment advisory performance fees of $450 million in 2019 increased $38 million from $412 million in 2018, primarily reflecting higher revenue from illiquid and liquid alternative products, partially offset by lower revenue from long-only equity products.
technology services revenue of $974 million for 2019 increased $189 million from $785 million in 2018, primarily reflecting the impact of the efront transaction and higher revenue from aladdin.
advisory and other revenue of $269 million in 2019 decreased $24 million from $293 million in 2018, primarily reflecting lower fees from advisory assignments.

gaap. expense increased $247 million, or 3%, from 2018, primarily driven by higher employee compensation and benefits expense, higher general and administration expense and expense linked to the efront transaction.
employee compensation and benefits expense increased $150 million, or 3%, to $4,470 million in 2019 from $4,320 million in 2018, primarily reflecting higher headcount, higher performance fees and higher deferred compensation expense. employees at december 31, 2019 totaled approximately 16,200 compared with approximately 14,900 at december 31, 2018.
general and administration expense increased $120 million from 2018, reflecting higher technology expense, higher product launch costs, the impact of the efront transaction and the impact of foreign exchange remeasurement expense, partially offset by lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions and lower marketing and promotional, and portfolio services expense.
amortization of intangible assets expense increased $47 million, or 94%, to $97 million in 2019, primarily reflecting amortization of intangible assets associated with the efront transaction.

balance sheet overview the following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a gaap basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and consolidated sponsored investment products.
the company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or noncontrolling interests that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders' equity or cash flows. management views the as adjusted balance sheet, which contains non-gaap financial measures, as an economic presentation of the company's total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
separate account assets and liabilities and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements separate account assets are maintained by blackrock life limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that is a registered life insurance company in the united kingdom, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. the company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. the separate account assets are not available to creditors of the company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the company's assets. the net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. while blackrock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, blackrock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
in addition, the company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under blackrock life limited securities lending arrangements as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. the collateral is not available to creditors of the company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the company's assets.
consolidated sponsored investment products the company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as vies and voting rights entities ("vres"), (collectively, "consolidated sponsored investment products"). see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information on the company's consolidation policy.
the company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by consolidated sponsored investment products to use in its operating activities. in addition, the company cannot readily sell investments held by consolidated sponsored investment products in order to obtain cash for use in the company's operations.

(2)   amounts represent the portion of assets and liabilities of consolidated sponsored investment products attributable to nci.
(4)   amount includes approximately $4.2 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles. see note 25, income taxes, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
the following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a gaap basis. please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing. the discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on blackrock's stockholders' equity.
assets. cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2019 and 2018 included $141 million and $245 million, respectively, of cash held by consolidated sponsored investment products (see liquidity and capital resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2019).
accounts receivable at december 31, 2019 increased $522 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to higher base fees, technology services and performance fee receivables. investments were $5,489 million at december 31, 2019 (for more information see investments herein). goodwill and intangible assets increased $1,566 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to the efront transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. other assets (including operating lease right-of-use ("rou") assets and property and equipment) increased $237 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to the initial recognition of the operating lease rou assets related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and an increase in certain corporate minority investments, property and equipment, and unit trust receivables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities), partially offset by a decrease in other assets of consolidated sponsored investment products.
liabilities. accrued compensation and benefits at december 31, 2019 increased $69 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to higher 2019 deferred compensation accruals. other liabilities increased $207 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to the initial recognition of the operating lease liabilities related to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance and higher unit trust payables (substantially offset by an increase in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets), partially offset by a decrease in contingent liability in connection with certain prior acquisitions, and restructuring liability payments and a decrease in other liabilities of consolidated sponsored investment products. net deferred income tax liabilities at december 31, 2019 increased $163 million from december 31, 2018, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with the efront transaction and investment income.
investments the company's investments were $5,489 million and $4,476 million at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. investments include consolidated investments held by sponsored investment products accounted for as vies and vres. management reviews blackrock's investments on an "economic" basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact blackrock's book value or net income attributable to blackrock. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with gaap.
the company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the company, net of nci, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to blackrock.
the company further presents net "economic" investment exposure, net of deferred compensation investments and hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. the economic impact of investments held pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements is offset by a change in compensation expense. the impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to blackrock's stockholders' equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. finally, the company's regulatory investment in federal reserve bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the company's net economic investment exposure.
total "economic" investment exposure                                      $2,707                $2,385
(1)   amount included $514 million and $369 million of carried interest (vies) as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which has no impact on the company's "economic" investment exposure.
the following table represents the carrying value of the company's economic investment exposure, by asset type, at december 31, 2019 and 2018:
total "economic" investment exposure            $2,707            $2,385
(1)   other alternatives primarily include hedge funds/funds of hedge funds.
(2)   other investments primarily include seed investments in fixed income, equity and multi-asset mutual funds/strategies as well as uk government securities, primarily held for regulatory purposes.

(1)   amount includes distributions representing return of capital and return on investments.
liquidity and capital resources blackrock cash flows excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products the consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the consolidated sponsored investment products. the company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, as a supplemental non-gaap measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. the company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment products, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of blackrock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. blackrock's management does not advocate that investors consider such non-gaap measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with gaap.

sources of blackrock's operating cash primarily include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory revenue and distribution fees. blackrock uses its cash to pay for all operating expense, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on blackrock's capital stock, repurchases of the company's stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.
for details of the company's gaap cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
cash flows provided by operating activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, primarily include the receipt of investment advisory and administration fees, securities lending revenue and performance fees offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive compensation accrued for in the prior year.
cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for 2019 were $1,904 million and primarily reflected $1.5 billion of cash outflow related to the efront transaction, $693 million of investment purchases and $254 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $417 million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of certain investments.
cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of consolidated sponsored investment products, for 2019 were $4,152 million, primarily resulting from $1.9 billion of share repurchases, including $400 million in open market transactions, a $1.3 billion private transaction and $245 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, $2.1 billion of cash dividend payments, and $1 billion of repayments of long-term borrowings, partially offset by $992 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings.
the company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. liquidity resources at december 31, 201 and 201 were as follows:
total liquidity resources(3)                                                               $8,688               $10,243
(1)   the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the company's us subsidiaries was approximately 45% and 50% at december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. see net capital requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries.
(2)   the company cannot readily access such cash to use in its operating activities.
(3)   amounts do not reflect a reduction for year-end incentive compensation accruals of approximately $1.4 billion for both 2019 and 2018, which are paid in the first quarter of the following year.
total liquidity resources decreased $1,555 million during 2019, primarily reflecting cash dividend payments of $2.1 billion, share repurchases of $1.9 billion, reflecting the impact of a $1.3 billion private transaction, and approximately $1.5 billion of cash outflow related to the efront transaction, partially offset by cash flows from operating activities.
a significant portion of the company's $3,995 million of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.
share repurchases. in january 2019, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional seven million shares under the company's existing share repurchase program for a total up to approximately 9.9 million shares of blackrock common stock.
during 2019, the company repurchased 4.0 million common shares under the share repurchase program for approximately $1.7 billion, including a $1.3 billion private transaction that closed on march 25, 2019. at december 31, 2019, there were 5.9 million shares still authorized to be repurchased.
net capital requirements. the company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. as a result, such subsidiaries of the company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.
blackrock institutional trust company, n.a. ("btc") is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. btc provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. btc is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the office of the comptroller of the currency.
at december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company was required to maintain approximately $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including btc, entities regulated by the financial conduct authority and prudential regulation authority in the united kingdom, and the company's broker-dealers. the company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. as a result of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act and the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, us income taxes were provided on the company's undistributed foreign earnings. the financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries remains indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. the company will continue to evaluate its capital management plans throughout 2020.
2019 revolving credit facility. the company's credit facility has an aggregate commitment amount of $4 billion and was amended in march 2019 to extend the maturity date to march 2024 (the "2019 credit facility"). the 2019 credit facility permits the company to request up to an additional $1 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, increasing the overall size of the 2019 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $5 billion. interest on borrowings outstanding accrues at a rate based on the applicable london interbank offered rate plus a spread. the 2019 credit facility requires the company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at december 31, 2019. the 2019 credit facility provides back-up liquidity to fund ongoing working capital for general corporate purposes and various investment opportunities. at december 31, 2019, the company had no amount outstanding under the credit facility.
commercial paper program.  the company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the "cp notes") on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. the commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2019 credit facility. at december 31, 2019, blackrock had no cp notes outstanding.
long-term borrowings the carrying value of long-term borrowings at december 31, 2019 included the following:
(1)   the carrying value of the 1.25% notes is calculated using the eur/usd foreign exchange rate as of december 31, 2019.
in april 2019, the company issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on april 30, 2029 (the "2029 notes"). the net proceeds of the 2029 notes were used for general corporate purposes, which included a portion of the purchase price of the efront transaction, repayment of a portion of the $1 billion 5.00% notes in december 2019 and repayment of borrowings under its commercial paper program. interest is payable semi-annually on april 30 and october 30 of each year, which commenced on october 30, 2019, and is approximately $33 million per year. the 2029 notes may be redeemed prior to january 30, 2029 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the company, at a "make-whole" redemption price or at par thereafter. the unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2029 notes.
in december 2019, the company fully repaid $1 billion of 5.00% notes at maturity.
in january 2020, the company issued $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.40% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on april 30, 2030 (the "2030 notes"). the net proceeds of the 2030 notes will be used for general corporate purposes. interest of approximately $24 million per year will be payable semi-annually on april 30 and october 30 of each year, commencing april 30, 2020. the 2030 notes may be redeemed prior to january 30, 2030 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the company, at a "make-whole" redemption price or at 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 notes thereafter. the discount and debt issuance costs will be amortized over the term of the 2030 notes.
for more information on company's borrowings, see note 15, borrowings, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies by year of payment at december 31, 2019:
operating leases                                                  158               152               141           125               110           1,682         2,368
contingent payments related to business acquisitions(2)           189                19                 -             -                 -               -           208
(1)   the amount of principal and interest payments for the 1.25% notes (issued in euros) represents the expected payment amounts using the eur/usd foreign exchange rate as of december 31, 2019.
(2)   the amount of contingent payments reflected for any year represents the expected payments using foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31, 2019. the fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at december 31, 2019 totaled $193 million and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
(3)   at december 31, 2019, the company had approximately $618 million of net unrecognized tax benefits. due to the uncertainty of timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, this amount has been excluded from the table above.
operating leases. the company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2043. in connection with certain lease agreements, the company is responsible for escalation payments. the contractual obligations table above includes only guaranteed minimum lease payments for such leases and does not project potential escalation or other lease-related payments.
in may 2017, the company entered into an agreement with 50 hymc owner llc, for the lease of approximately 847,000 square feet of office space located at 50 hudson yards, new york, new york. the term of the lease is twenty years from the date that rental payments begin, expected to occur in may 2023, with the option to renew for a specified term. the lease requires annual base rental payments of approximately $51 million per year during the first five years of the lease term, increasing every five years to $58 million, $66 million and $74 million per year (or approximately $1.2 billion in base rent over its twenty-year term). in november 2019, the company exercised its initial expansion option with respect to two additional floors of approximately 122,000 square feet of office space. the additional space requires approximately $185 million in base rent over its twenty-year term.
for more information on the company's operating leases, see note 13, leases, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
purchase obligations. in the ordinary course of business, blackrock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of blackrock. purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. at december 31, 201, the company's obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio services, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31, 2019.
investment commitments. at december 31, 2019, the company had $553 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including consolidated sponsored investment products. these products include private equity funds, real assets funds and opportunistic funds. this amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. these unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. these commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the company that are not yet legally binding. the company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.
contingent payments related to business acquisitions. in connection with certain acquisitions, blackrock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets, which may include revenue related to acquired contracts or new capital commitments for certain products. the fair value of the remaining aggregate contingent payments at december 31, 2019 totaled $193 million, and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
carried interest clawback. as a general partner in certain investment products, including private equity partnerships and certain hedge funds, the company may receive carried interest cash distributions from the partnerships in accordance with distribution provisions of the partnership agreements. the company may, from time to time, be required to return all or a portion of such distributions to the limited partners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a return as specified in the various partnership agreements. therefore, blackrock records carried interest subject to such clawback provisions in investments, or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, and as a deferred carried interest liability on its consolidated statements of financial condition. carried interest is recorded as performance fees on blackrock's consolidated statements of income when fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
indemnifications. in the ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements, blackrock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances. the terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote and, therefore, has not been included in the table above or recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition at december 31, 2019. see further discussion in note 16, commitments and contingencies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing.
on behalf of certain clients, the company lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. in these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. in connection with securities lending transactions, blackrock has agreed to indemnify certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower's failure to fulfill its obligations under the securities lending agreement should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower's obligation under the securities lending agreement. the amount of securities on loan as of december 31, 2019 and subject to this type of indemnification was $210 billion. in the company's capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling $226 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december 31, 2019. the fair value of these indemnifications was not material at december 31, 2019.
while the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower's obligations to return securities borrowed and any other amounts owing to the lender under the relevant securities lending agreement, in the event of a borrower default, the company can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. if the amount of such pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill such obligations to a client for whom the company has provided indemnification, blackrock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall. these indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not in any way guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested.
compensation and benefit obligations. the company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the contractual obligations and commitments table above. accrued compensation and benefits at december 31, 2019 totaled $2,057 million and included annual incentive compensation of $1,372 million, deferred compensation of $399 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $286 million. substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2020, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over various periods, with the majority payable over periods of up to three years.
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements. for a summary of these and additional accounting policies see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this filing, including information regarding the adoption of accounting standards update 2016-02, leases.
consolidation in the normal course of business, the company is the manager of various types of sponsored investment vehicles. the company performs an analysis for investment products to determine if the product is a vie or a vre. assessing whether an entity is a vie or a vre involves judgment and analysis. factors considered in this assessment include the entity's legal organization, the entity's capital structure and equity ownership, and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. investments that are determined to be vres are consolidated if the company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. investments that are determined to be vies are consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary ("pb") of the entity. blackrock is deemed to be the pb of a vie if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the vie. the company generally consolidates vies in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such vies once equity ownership falls below 10%. see note 6, consolidated sponsored investment products, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
investments equity method investments. for equity investments where blackrock does not control the investee, and where it is not the pb of a vie, but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, the company follows the equity method of accounting. the evaluation of whether the company exerts control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment. factors considered in these evaluations may include the type of investment, the legal structure of the investee, the terms and structure of the investment agreement, including investor voting or other rights, the terms of blackrock's advisory agreement or other agreements with the investee, any influence blackrock may have on the governing board of the investee, the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund's operating documents and the relationship between blackrock and other investors in the entity.
blackrock's equity method investees that are investment companies record their underlying investments at fair value. therefore, under the equity method of accounting, blackrock's share of the investee's underlying net income predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investees. blackrock's share of the investee's underlying net income or loss is based upon the most currently available information and is recorded as nonoperating income (expense) for investments in investment companies, or as advisory and other revenue for certain corporate minority investments, which are recorded in other assets, since such investees are considered to be an extension of blackrock's core business.
at december 31, 2019, the company had $943 million and $531 million of equity method investments, included in investments and other assets, respectively, and at december 31, 2018, the company had $781 million and $459 million of equity method investments included in investments and other assets, respectively.
other nonequity method corporate minority investments.  other nonequity method corporate minority investments are recorded within other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. at december 31, 2019 and 2018, these investments totaled $282 million and $199 million, respectively, and included investments in equity securities, which are generally measured at fair value or under the measurement alternative to fair value for nonmarketable securities. changes in value of these securities are recorded in nonoperating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
impairments of investments. evaluation of impairments involves significant assumptions and management judgments, which could differ from actual results, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of income. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information.
fair value measurements the company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements.
changes in valuation. changes in value on $5,489 million of investments will impact the company's nonoperating income (expense), $342 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $528 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). at december 31, 2019, changes in fair value of $3,270 million of consolidated sponsored investment products will impact blackrock's net income (loss) attributable to nci on the consolidated statements of income. blackrock's net exposure to changes in fair value of consolidated sponsored investment products was $1,776 million.
leases the company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. the identification of whether a contract contains a lease requires judgment, including determining whether there are identified assets in the contract that the company has control over for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration.
fixed lease payments are included in the measurement of rou assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition. the company recognizes rou assets and lease liabilities based on the present value of these future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date discounted using the company's incremental borrowing rate ("ibr"). management judgment is required in determining the company's ibr, including assessing the company's credit rating using various financial metrics, such as revenue, operating margin and revenue growth, and, as appropriate, performing market analysis of yields on publicly traded bonds (secured or unsecured) of comparable companies. see note 2, significant accounting policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information on leases.
goodwill and intangible assets the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage aum in proprietary open-end investment funds as well as collective trust funds without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. the assignment of indefinite lives to such investment fund contracts is based upon the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these funds due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost. in addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized.
finite-lived management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds, investor/customer relationships, and technology related assets that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the company for a specified period of time are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at december 31, 2019 ranged from 1 to 11 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of 7.8 years.
goodwill. the company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the company. the impairment assessment performed as of july 31, 2019 indicated no impairment charge was required. the company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. at december 31, 2019, the company's common stock closed at $502.70, which exceeded its book value of approximately $216.15 per share.
indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. the company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate.
in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, blackrock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including aum, revenue basis points, projected aum growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. in addition, the company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity's services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) the company-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. if an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
for finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. if the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.
in addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $97 million, $50 million and $89 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
in 2019, 2018 and 2017, the company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. the company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles. the company continuously monitors various factors, including aum, for potential indicators of impairment.
contingent consideration liabilities in connection with certain acquisitions, blackrock is required to make contingent payments, subject to achieving specified performance targets. the fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated at the time of acquisition closing and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. as the fair value of the expected payments amount subsequently changes, the contingent consideration liability is adjusted, resulting in contingent consideration fair value adjustments recorded within general and administration expense of the consolidated statements of income. cash payments up to the acquisition date fair value amount of the contingent consideration liability are reflected as financing activities with excess (if any) cash payments classified in operating activities. any cash payments made soon after the acquisition date will be classified in investing activities.
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised services to customers in an amount to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. the company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. management judgment is required to identify distinct services and involves assessing such factors as whether the promised services significantly modify or customize one another or are highly interdependent or interrelated. management judgment may be also required when determining the following: when variable consideration is no longer probable of significant reversal (and hence can be included in revenue); whether certain revenue should be presented gross or net of certain related costs; when a promised service transfers to the customer; and the applicable method of measuring progress for services transferred to the customer over time. many of blackrock's promised services represent a series of distinct services (e.g., investment advisory services) in which the associated variable consideration (e.g., management fees) is allocated to specific days of service as opposed to over the entire contract term.
investment advisory and administration fees are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the company. fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of aum and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. such fees are affected by changes in aum, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. aum represents the broad range of financial assets the company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. in general, reported aum reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset values).
the company earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. the securities loaned are secured by collateral, generally ranging from 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. for 2019, 2018 and 2017, securities lending revenue earned by the company totaled $617 million, $627 million and $597 million, respectively, and is recorded in investment advisory, administration and securities lending revenue on the consolidated statements of income. investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue are reported together as the fees for these services often are agreed upon with clients as a bundled fee.
the company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. these performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which may vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods.
performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund's investment or when the amount of aum becomes known as of the end of a specified measurement period). given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. significant judgement is involved in making such determination. performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. consequently, a portion of the fees the company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. at each reporting date, the company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. these factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the fees are dependent on the market and thus are highly susceptible to factors outside the company's influence; (2) the fees have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to invest or reinvest their sales proceeds.
the company is allocated carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. the company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these funds. carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition.
the company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. at december 31, 2019 and 2018, the company had $483 million and $293 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. a portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. the ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, for these products is unknown. see note 17, revenue, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2019 and 2018.
fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed and are generally determined using the value of positions on the aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis. revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights.
distribution and service fees earned for distributing investment products and providing support services to investment portfolios, are based on aum, and are recognized when the amount of fees is known.
adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of blackrock's investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on aum and since the company does not record performance fee revenue until: (1) performance thresholds have been exceeded and (2) management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal.
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the company's current estimates. at december 31, 2019, blackrock had $900 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $513 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.
management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. at december 31, 2019, the company had deferred income tax assets of $175 million and deferred income tax liabilities of $3,734 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the company.
the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. the assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
the company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. the company's actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. the company had current income taxes receivables of approximately $282 million and current income taxes payables of $293 million at december 31, 2019.

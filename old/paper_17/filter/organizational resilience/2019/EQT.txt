item 1a.       risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. note that additional risks not presently known to us or that are currently considered immaterial may also have a negative impact on our business and operations. if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.
natural gas, ngls and oil price volatility, or a prolonged period of low natural gas, ngls and oil prices, may have an adverse effect upon our revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, liquidity and financial position.
our revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, liquidity and financial position depend upon the prices for natural gas, ngls and oil. the prices for natural gas, ngls and oil have historically been volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. the prices are affected by a number of factors beyond our control, which include:
•   weather conditions and seasonal trends;
•   the domestic and foreign supply of and demand for natural gas, ngls and oil;
•   prevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which we operate and expectations about future commodity prices;
•   national and worldwide economic and political conditions;
•   new and competing exploratory finds of natural gas, ngls and oil;
•   changes in u.s. exports of natural gas, ngls and oil;
•   the effect of energy conservation efforts;
•   the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels;
•   the availability, proximity, capacity and cost of pipelines, other transportation facilities, and gathering, processing and storage facilities and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices;
•   technological advances affecting energy consumption and production;
•   the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries;
•   the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including commodity price speculators and others;
•   the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting natural gas, ngls and oil;
•   the level of global inventories;
•   risks associated with drilling, completion and production operations; and
•   domestic, local and foreign governmental regulations, tariffs and taxes, including environmental and climate change regulation.
the daily spot prices for nymex henry hub natural gas ranged from a high of $4.12 per mmbtu to a low of $1.82 per mmbtu from january 1, 2019 through december 31, 2019, and the daily spot prices for nymex west texas intermediate crude oil ranged from a high of $66.24 per barrel to a low of $46.31 per barrel during the same period. in addition, the market price for natural gas in the appalachian basin continues to be lower relative to nymex henry hub as a result of the significant increases in the supply of natural gas in the northeast united states in recent years. because our production and reserves predominantly consist of natural gas (approximately 95% of equivalent proved developed reserves), changes in natural gas prices have significantly greater impact on our financial results than oil prices. ngls are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics, which adds further volatility to the pricing of ngls. due to the volatility of commodity prices, we are unable to predict future potential movements in the market prices for natural gas, ngls and oil at the company's ultimate sales points and thus cannot predict the ultimate impact of prices on our operations.
prolonged low, and/or significant or extended declines in, natural gas, ngls and oil prices may adversely affect our revenues, operating income, cash flows and financial position, particularly if we are unable to control our development costs during periods of lower natural gas, ngls and oil prices. declines in prices could also adversely affect our drilling activities and the amount of natural gas, ngls and oil that we can produce economically, which may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to the value of our assets and could cause us to incur non-cash impairment charges to earnings. reductions in cash flows from lower commodity prices may require us to incur additional borrowings or to reduce our capital spending, which could reduce our production and our reserves, negatively affecting our future rate of growth. lower prices for natural gas, ngls and oil may also adversely affect our credit ratings and result in a reduction in our borrowing capacity and access to other capital. see "impairment of oil and gas properties" in item 7., "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and "natural gas, ngls and oil price declines, and changes in our development strategy, have resulted in impairment of certain of our assets. future declines in commodity prices, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance or additional changes in our development strategy may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, including long-lived intangible assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods." we are also exposed to the risk of non-performance by our hedge counterparties in the event that changes, positive or negative, in natural gas prices result in our derivative contracts having a positive fair value in our favor. further, adverse economic and market conditions could negatively affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our hedge counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection.
increases in natural gas, ngls and oil prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs, increased production taxes, increased lease operating expenses, increased volatility in seasonal gas price spreads for our storage assets and increased end-user conservation or conversion to alternative fuels. significant natural gas price increases may subject us to margin calls on our commodity price derivative contracts (hedging arrangements, including swap, collar and option agreements and exchange-traded instruments), which would potentially require us to post significant amounts of cash collateral with our hedge counterparties. the cash collateral provided to our hedge counterparties, which is interest-bearing, is returned to us in whole or in part upon a reduction in forward market prices, depending on the amount of such reduction, or in whole upon settlement of the related derivative contract. in addition, to the extent we have hedged our current production at prices below the current market price, we are unable to benefit fully from an increase in the price of natural gas.
drilling for and producing natural gas and oil are high-risk and costly activities with many uncertainties. our future financial position, cash flows and results of operations will depend on the success of our development and acquisition activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable natural gas or oil production or that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells.
many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:
•   delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements, including limitations resulting from permitting, wastewater disposal, discharge of greenhouse gases, and limitations on hydraulic fracturing;
•   shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, rigs, materials and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;
•   equipment failures, accidents or other unexpected operational events;
•   lack of available gathering and water facilities or delays in construction of gathering and water facilities;
•   lack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;
•   adverse weather conditions, such as flooding, droughts, freeze-offs, slips, blizzards and ice storms;
•   issues related to compliance with environmental regulations;
•   environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;
•   declines in natural gas, ngls and oil market prices;
•   limited availability of financing at acceptable terms;
•   title, surface access, coal mining and right of way problems; and
•   limitations in the market for natural gas, ngls and oil.
any of these risks can cause a delay in our development program or result in substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties.
further, our decisions to purchase, explore or develop prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see "our proved reserves are estimates that are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves." in addition, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences.
our drilling locations are scheduled out over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling. in addition, we may not be able to raise the substantial amount of capital that would be necessary to drill our drilling locations.
our management team has specifically identified and scheduled certain well locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. these well locations represent a significant part of our business strategy. our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including natural gas, ngls and oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, topography, gathering system and pipeline transportation costs and constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, coordination with coal mining, regulatory approvals and other factors. because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas, ngls or oil from these or any other drilling locations. in addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. further, certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling or unitization with adjacent leaseholds controlled by third parties. if these third parties are unwilling to pool or unitize such leaseholds with ours, the total locations we can drill may be limited. as such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.
in addition, we will require significant additional capital over a prolonged period in order to pursue the development of these locations, and we may not be able to raise or generate the capital required to do so. any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these potential locations may not be successful, may not increase our overall production levels and proved reserves or may result in a downward revision of our estimated proved reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our future business and results of operations. for more information on our drilling locations, see item 1., "business."
the amount and timing of actual future natural gas, ngls and oil production is difficult to predict and may vary significantly from our estimates, which may reduce our earnings.
because the rate of production from natural gas and oil wells, and associated ngls, generally declines as reserves are depleted, our future success depends upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to optimize existing well production, and our failure to do so may reduce our earnings. additionally, a failure to effectively and efficiently operate existing wells may cause production volumes to fall short of our projections. our drilling and subsequent maintenance of wells can involve significant risks, including those related to timing, cost overruns and operational efficiency, and these risks can be affected by the availability of capital, leases, rigs, equipment, a qualified work force, and adequate capacity for the treatment and recycling or disposal of waste water generated in our operations, as well as weather conditions, natural gas, ngls and oil price volatility, government approvals, title and property access problems, geology, equipment failure or accidents and other factors. drilling for natural gas and oil can be unprofitable, not only from dry wells, but from productive wells that perform below expectations or do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit. low natural gas, ngls and oil prices may further limit the types of reserves that we can develop and produce economically.
except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. future natural gas, ngls and oil production, therefore, is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves that are economically recoverable. we cannot be certain that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an acceptable cost. without continued successful development or acquisition activities, together with efficient operation of existing wells, our reserves and production, together with associated revenues, will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production.
our proved reserves are estimates that are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. any significant change in these underlying assumptions will greatly affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.
reserve engineering is a subjective process involving estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas, ngls and oil and assumptions concerning future prices, production levels and operating and development costs, some of which are beyond our control. these estimates and assumptions are inherently imprecise, and we may adjust our estimates of proved reserves based on changes in these estimates or assumptions. as a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate. any significant variance from our assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas, ngls and oil, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows. to the extent we experience a sustained period of reduced commodity prices, there is a risk that a portion of our proved reserves could be deemed uneconomic and no longer be classified as proved. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, actual production, revenues and costs to develop reserves will likely vary from estimates and these variances could be material. numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of natural gas, ngls and oil we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates.
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas, ngls and crude oil reserves.
you should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas, ngls and crude oil reserves. in accordance with sec requirements, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the preceding twelve months without giving effect to derivative transactions. actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by factors such as the actual prices we receive for natural gas, ngls and oil, the amount, timing and cost of actual production and changes in governmental regulations or taxation. the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. in addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating the standardized measure may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our operations or the natural gas, ngls and oil industry in general.
we are under the leadership of a substantially reconstituted board of directors and a new executive management team who have implemented a variety of operational, organizational, cultural and other changes to our business and reserves development strategy, and we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the transformation plan or reserves development strategy.
our board of directors was substantially reconstituted at our annual meeting of shareholders on july 10, 2019 and, following that meeting, toby z. rice was appointed as president and chief executive officer. thereafter, our new executive management team implemented a detailed transformation plan designed to effect operational, organizational, cultural and other changes to our business in order to lower operating costs and increase free cash flow generation through improved efficiency, well performance and the use of technology, with a primary focus on repositioning the company to effectively execute on large-scale combo-development projects, which consist of developing multiple wells and pads simultaneously. we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from this transformation plan. additionally, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully execute combo-development projects at the pace and scale that we project, which may delay or reduce our production and our reserves, negatively affecting our associated revenues.
strategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial position and reduce our future prospects.
our future prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business. in developing our business plan, we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our business, including well development, reserve acquisitions, corporate items, leasehold maintenance and other alternatives. we also considered our likely sources of capital. notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our business plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. if we fail to identify and execute optimal business strategies, including the appropriate corporate structure and appropriate rate of reserve development, or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial position and growth rate may be adversely affected. moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.
we may not be able to successfully execute our plan to deleverage our business or otherwise reduce our debt level.
in the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced the deleveraging plan. there can be no assurance that we will be able to find attractive asset monetization opportunities or that any such transactions will be completed on our anticipated timeframe, if at all. furthermore, our estimated value for the assets to be monetized under the deleveraging plan involves multiple assumptions and judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain; accordingly, there can be no assurance that the resulting net cash proceeds from asset monetization transactions will be as anticipated, even if such transactions are consummated. some of the factors that could affect our ability to successfully execute the deleveraging plan include changes in the financial condition or prospects of prospective purchasers and the availability of financing to potential purchasers on reasonable terms, the number of prospective purchasers, the number of competing assets on the market, unfavorable economic conditions, industry trends and changes in laws and regulations. if we are not able to successfully execute the deleveraging plan or otherwise reduce absolute debt to a level we believe appropriate, our credit ratings may be lowered, we may reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or investments, and we may revise or delay our strategic plans.
our exploration and production operations have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms.
our business is capital intensive. we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the development and acquisition of natural gas, ngls and oil reserves. we typically fund our capital expenditures with existing cash and cash generated by operations and, to the extent our capital expenditures exceed our cash resources, from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other external sources of capital. if we do not have sufficient borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, we may seek alternate debt or equity financing, sell assets or reduce our capital expenditures. the issuance of additional indebtedness would require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. the actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, natural gas prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments.
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:
•   our level of proved reserves and production;
•   the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;
•   our access to, and the cost of accessing, end markets for our production;
•   the levels of our operating expenses; and
•   our ability to access the public or private capital markets or borrow under our revolving credit facility.
if our cash flows from operations or the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to fund our capital expenditures and we are unable to obtain the capital necessary for our planned capital budget or our operations, we could be required to curtail our operations and the development of our properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.
as of december 31, 2019, our senior notes were rated "baa3" with a "negative" outlook by moody's investors services (moody's), "bbb-" with a "negative" outlook by standard & poor's ratings service (s&p) and "bbb-" with a "negative" outlook by fitch ratings service (fitch). in january 2020, moody's downgraded our senior notes rating to "ba1" with a "negative" outlook. in february 2020, s&p downgraded our senior notes rating to "bb+" with a "negative" outlook, and fitch downgraded our senior notes rating to "bb" with a "negative" outlook. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the downgrades on our financial statements subsequent to december 31, 2019. although we are not aware of any current plans of moody's, s&p or fitch to further downgrade its rating of our senior notes, we cannot be assured that one or more will not further downgrade or withdraw entirely their rating of our senior notes. low prices for natural gas, ngls and oil, an increase in the level of our indebtedness or a failure to significantly execute our deleveraging plan may result in moody's, s&p or fitch further downgrading its rating of our senior notes. if there are further downgrades to our credit rating, our access to the capital markets may be impacted, the cost of short-term debt through interest rates and fees under our lines of credit may increase, the interest rate on our term loan facility and adjustable rate notes (each defined in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements) will increase, the rates available on new long-term debt may increase, our pool of investors and funding sources may decrease, the borrowing costs and margin deposit requirements on our derivative instruments may increase and we may be required to provide additional credit assurances, including collateral, in support of our midstream service contracts, joint venture arrangements or construction contracts, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.
risks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately $5,293 million of debt outstanding, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. increases in our level of indebtedness may:
•   require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments, which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities;
•   limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making certain investments, and paying dividends;
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt service obligations;
•   depending on the levels of our outstanding debt, limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes; and
•   increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business or the economy, including declines in prices for natural gas, ngls and oil.
our debt agreements also require compliance with certain covenants. if the price that we receive for our natural gas, ngls and oil production deteriorates from current levels or continues for an extended period, it could lead to reduced revenues, cash flow and earnings, which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance. for more information about our debt agreements, read "capital resources and liquidity" in item 7., "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
we are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks.
our business and operating results can be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or other increases in the cost of capital resulting from a reduction in our credit rating or otherwise. these changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow used for operating and capital expenditures and place us at a competitive disadvantage.
disruptions or volatility in the financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. a significant reduction in the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve favorable operating results. in addition, we are exposed to credit risk related to our revolving credit facility to the extent that one or more of our lenders may be unable to provide necessary funding to us under our existing revolving line of credit if it experiences liquidity problems.
uncertainty related to the libor calculation process and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations.
loans to us under our credit facility may be base rate loans or libor loans. libor is calculated by reference to a market for interbank lending, and it's based on increasingly fewer actual transactions. this increases the subjectivity of the libor calculation process and increases the risk of manipulation. actions by the regulators or law enforcement agencies, as well as ice benchmark administration (the current administrator of libor), may result in changes to the manner that libor is determined or the establishment of alternative reference rates. for example, on july 27, 2017, the u.k. financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021. u.s. dollar libor will likely be replaced by the secured overnight financing rate (sofr) published by the federal reserve bank of new york; however, the timing of this shift is currently unknown. sofr is an overnight rate instead of a term rate, making sofr an inexact replacement for libor, and there is not an established process to create robust, forward-looking, sofr term rates. changing the benchmark rate for libor loans from libor to sofr requires calculations of a spread. industry organizations are attempting to structure the spread calculation in a manner that minimizes the possibility of value transfer between counterparties, borrowers, and lenders by the transition, but there is no assurance that the calculated spread will be fair and accurate. at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to libor that may be implemented. if libor ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit facility to determine the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that is established. as such, the potential effect of any such event on our interest expense cannot yet be determined.
derivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks.
to manage our exposure to price risk, we currently and may in the future enter into derivative arrangements, utilizing commodity derivatives with respect to a portion of our future production. such hedges are designed to lock in prices in order to limit volatility and increase the predictability of cash flow. these transactions limit our potential gains if natural gas, ngls and oil prices rise above the price established by the hedge. in addition, derivative transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:
•   an event materially impacts natural gas, ngls or oil prices or the relationship between the hedged price index and the natural gas, ngls or oil sales price.
we cannot be certain that any derivative transaction we may enter into will adequately protect us from declines in the prices of natural gas, ngls or oil. furthermore, where we choose not to engage in derivative transactions in the future, we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas, ngls or oil prices than our competitors who engage in derivative transactions. lower natural gas, ngls and oil prices may also negatively impact our ability to enter into derivative contracts at favorable prices.
derivative transactions also expose us to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract or enters bankruptcy or encounters some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint. in this case, we may not be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities. during periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.
we are subject to risks associated with the operation of our wells and facilities.
our business is subject to all of the inherent hazards and risks normally incidental to drilling for, producing, transporting and storing natural gas, ngls and oil, such as fires, explosions, slips, landslides, blowouts, and well cratering; pipe and other equipment and system failures; delays imposed by, or resulting from, compliance with regulatory requirements; formations with abnormal or unexpected pressures; shortages of, or delays in, obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities; adverse weather conditions, such as freeze offs of wells and pipelines due to cold weather; issues related to compliance with environmental regulations; environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized releases of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the environment, especially those that reach surface water or groundwater; inadvertent third-party damage to our assets, and natural disasters. we also face various risks or threats to the operation and security of our or third parties' facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants, compressor stations and pipelines. any of these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, equipment and natural resources, pollution or other environmental damage, loss of hydrocarbons, disruptions to our operations, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of our operations, repair and remediation costs, and loss of sensitive confidential information. moreover, in the event that one or more of these hazards occur, there can be no assurance that a response will be adequate to limit or reduce damage. as a result of these risks, we are also sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. there can be no assurance that the insurance policies we maintain to limit our liability for such losses will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or to cover all risks. in addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable, and we may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
cyber incidents targeting our systems or natural gas and oil industry systems and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations.
our business and the natural gas and oil industry in general have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications, and the maintenance of our financial and other records has long been dependent upon such technologies. we depend on this technology to record and store data, estimate quantities of natural gas, ngls and oil reserves, analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally. computers control nearly all of the natural gas, ngls and oil distribution systems in the u.s., which are necessary to transport our products to market.
the u.s. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. we can provide no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks in the future. deliberate attacks on, or unintentional events affecting, our systems or infrastructure, the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in production or delivery of natural gas, ngls and oil, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, communication interruptions, environmental damage, personal injury, property damage, other operational disruptions and third-party liability. further, as cyber incidents continue to evolve and cyber attackers become more sophisticated, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. the cost to remedy an unintended dissemination of sensitive information or data may be significant. furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention. to the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.
failure to timely develop our leased real property could result in increased capital expenditures and/or impairment of our leases.
mineral rights are typically owned by individuals who may enter into property leases with us to allow for the development of natural gas. such leases expire after an initial term, typically five years, unless certain actions are taken to preserve the lease. if we cannot preserve a lease, the lease terminates. approximately 24% of our net undeveloped acres are subject to leases that could expire over the next three years. lack of access to capital, changes in government regulations, changes in future development plans, reduced drilling activity, or the reduction in the fair value of undeveloped properties in the areas in which we operate could impact our ability to preserve, trade, or sell our leases prior to their expiration resulting in the termination and impairment of leases for properties that we have not developed.
capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated at least annually for recoverability on a prospective basis. indicators of potential impairment include changes brought about by economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy employed by management and historical experience. the likelihood of an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties increases as the expiration of a lease term approaches and drilling activity has not commenced. for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded lease impairments and expirations of $556.4 million, $279.7 million and $7.6 million, respectively. refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.
our inability to cure any title defects in our leases in a timely and cost-efficient manner may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest, which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. the existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
substantially all of our producing properties are concentrated in the appalachian basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in one major geographic area.
substantially all of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the appalachian basin. as a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in these areas caused by, and costs associated with, governmental regulation, state and local political activities, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages or other weather-related conditions, interruption of the processing or transportation of natural gas, ngls or oil and changes in state and local laws, judicial precedents, political regimes and regulations. such conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
in addition, a number of areas within the appalachian basin have historically been subject to mining operations. for example, third parties may engage in subsurface coal and other mining operations near or under our properties, which could cause subsidence or other damage to our properties, adversely impact our drilling operations or adversely impact third-party midstream activities on which we rely. in such event, our operations may be impaired or interrupted, and we may not be able to recover the costs incurred as a result of temporary shut-ins or the plugging and abandonment of any of our wells. furthermore, the existence of mining operations near our properties could require coordination to avoid adverse impacts as a result of drilling and mining in close proximity. these restrictions on our operations, and any similar restrictions, could cause delays or interruptions or prevent us from executing our business strategy, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
further, insufficient takeaway capacity in the appalachian basin could cause significant fluctuations in our realized natural gas prices. the appalachian basin has recently experienced periods in which production has surpassed local takeaway capacity, resulting in substantial discounts in the price received by producers such as us and others at times being possibly shut in. although additional appalachian basin takeaway capacity has been added in recent years, the existing and expected capacity may not be sufficient to keep pace with the increased production caused by accelerated drilling in the area in the short term.
due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of natural gas properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties.
natural gas, ngls and oil price declines, and changes in our development strategy, have resulted in impairment of certain of our assets. future declines in commodity prices, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance or additional changes in our development strategy may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, including long-lived intangible assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.
we review the carrying values of our proved oil and gas properties and goodwill for indications of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. in addition, we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations because the results are based on estimated future events and estimated future cash flows. the estimated future cash flows used to test our proved oil and gas properties for recoverability are based on proved and, if determined reasonable by management, risk-adjusted probable reserves, utilizing assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions used by our management for internal planning and budgeting purposes. key assumptions used in our analyses, include, among other things, the intended use of the asset, the anticipated production from reserves, future market prices for natural gas, ngls and oil, future operating costs, inflation and the anticipated proceeds that may be received upon divestiture if there is a possibility that the asset will be divested prior to the end of its useful life. commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of the five-year nymex forward strip prices and assumptions related to gas quality, locational basis adjustments and inflation. proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are written down to fair value, which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rate assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. additionally, when testing goodwill for impairment, we also consider the market value of our common stock and other valuation techniques when determining the fair value of our single reporting unit.
during the fourth quarter of 2019, there were indicators that the carrying values of certain of our properties may be impaired due to depressed natural gas prices and changes in our development strategy, including our contemplation of a potential asset monetization of certain of our non-strategic exploration and production assets. as a result of our 2019 impairment evaluation, we recorded total impairment of $1,124.4 million, of which $1,035.7 million was associated with our non-strategic assets located in the ohio utica and $88.7 million was associated with our pennsylvania and west virginia utica assets. it is possible that we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods as a result of the above indicators or otherwise. in particular, future declines in natural gas, ngls or oil prices, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance, among other things, may result in our having to make significant future downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and/or could result in additional non-cash impairment charges to write-down the carrying amount of our assets, including other long-lived intangible assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods. any impairment of our assets, including other long-lived intangible assets, would require us to take an immediate charge to earnings. such charges could be material to our results of operations and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. see "impairment of oil and gas properties" in item 7., "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
the unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, completion services, equipment, supplies, personnel, and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.
the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other professionals in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices, causing periodic shortages or higher costs. historically, there have been shortages of personnel and equipment as demand for personnel and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. we cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. such shortages could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
our ability to drill for and produce natural gas and oil is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for drilling and completion operations and access to water and waste disposal or recycling services at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules. restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of produced water and other waste may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
the hydraulic fracture stimulation process on which we depend to drill and complete natural gas and oil wells requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water. our ability to access sources of water and the availability of disposal alternatives to receive all of the water produced from our wells and used in hydraulic fracturing may affect our drilling and completion operations. our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, or to timely obtain water sourcing permits or other rights, could adversely affect our operations. additionally, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to obtain water or dispose of waste, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations, which could result in decreased cash flows.
in addition, federal and state regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for natural gas and oil waste disposal and increased seismic activity in certain areas. in some cases, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity in the states where we operate could lead to restrictions on our disposal well injection volumes and increased scrutiny of and delay in obtaining new disposal well permits, which could result in increased operating costs, which could be material, or a curtailment of our operations.
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic, operational and financial plans.
our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. in addition, the success of our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain experienced personnel. there is competition within our industry for experienced technical personnel and certain other professionals, which could increase the costs associated with identifying, attracting and retaining such personnel. if we cannot identify, attract, develop and retain our technical and professional personnel or attract additional experienced technical and professional personnel, our ability to compete in our industry could be harmed.
competition in our industry is intense, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do, which could adversely affect our competitive position.
competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense. major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable oil and gas properties, as well as for the capital, equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties. many of our competitors have financial resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours. these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. in addition, these companies may be able to expend greater resources on existing and changing processes and may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation.
we depend on third-party midstream providers for a significant portion of our midstream services, and our failure to obtain and maintain access to the necessary infrastructure to successfully deliver natural gas, ngls and oil to market on competitive terms may adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and results of operations.
our delivery of natural gas, ngls and oil depends upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, other transportation facilities and gathering and processing facilities primarily owned by third parties, and our ability to contract with these third parties at competitive rates or at all. the capacity of transmission, gathering and processing facilities may be insufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells, which may result in substantial discounts in the prices we receive for our natural gas, ngls and oil or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. competition for access to pipeline infrastructure within the appalachian basin is intense, and our ability to secure access to pipeline infrastructure on favorable economic terms could affect our competitive position.
we are dependent on third-party providers to provide us with access to midstream infrastructure to get our produced natural gas, ngls and oil to market. to the extent these services are delayed or unavailable, we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production. access to midstream assets may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons. in addition, at current commodity prices, construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may occur more slowly. a lack of access to needed infrastructure, or an extended interruption of access to or service from third-party pipelines and facilities for any reason, including vandalism, sabotage or cyber-attacks on such pipelines and facilities or service interruptions due to gas quality, could result in adverse consequences to us, such as delays in producing and selling our natural gas, ngls and oil.
finally, in order to ensure access to certain midstream facilities, we have entered into agreements that obligate us to pay demand charges to various pipeline operators. we also have commitments with third parties for processing capacity. we may be obligated to make payments under these agreements even if we do not fully use the capacity we have reserved, and these payments may be significant.
the substantial majority of our midstream and water services are provided by one provider, eqm midstream partners lp (eqm), an affiliate of equitrans midstream. therefore, any regulatory, infrastructure, or other events that materially adversely affect eqm's business operations will have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business and operating results as compared to similar events experienced by our other third-party service providers. additionally, our midstream services contracts with eqm involve significant long-term financial and other commitments on our part, which hinders our ability to diversify our slate of midstream service providers and seek better economic and other terms for the midstream services that are provided to us. we have no control over equitrans midstream's or eqm's business decisions and operations, and neither equitrans midstream nor eqm is under any obligation to adopt a business strategy that favors us.
historically, we have received the substantial majority of our natural gas gathering, transmission and storage and water services from eqm. additionally, on february 26, 2020, we executed a new gas gathering agreement with eqm (the new eqm gathering agreement), which, among other things, consolidated the majority of our prior gathering agreements with eqm into a single agreement, established a new fee structure for gathering and compression fees charged by eqm, increased our minimum volume commitments with eqm, committed certain of our remaining undedicated acreage to eqm and extended our and eqm's contractual obligations with each other to 2035. because we have significant long-term contractual commitments with eqm, we expect to receive the majority of our midstream and water services from eqm for the foreseeable future. therefore, any event, whether in our areas of operations or otherwise, that adversely affects eqm's operations, water assets, pipelines, other transportation facilities, gathering and processing facilities, financial condition, leverage, results of operations or cash flows will have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business and operating results as compared to similar events experienced by our other third-party service providers. accordingly, we are subject to the business risks of eqm, including the following:
•   federal, state and local regulatory, political and legal actions that could adversely affect eqm's operations, assets and infrastructure, including potential further delays associated with obtaining regulatory approval for the construction of the mountain valley pipeline and the mvp southgate project;
•   construction risks associated with the construction or repair of eqm's pipelines and other midstream infrastructure, such as delays caused by landowners or advocacy groups opposed to the natural gas industry, environmental hazards, adverse weather conditions, the performance of third-party contractors, the lack of available skilled labor, equipment and materials and the inability to obtain necessary rights-of-way or approvals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis or at all (and maintain such rights-of-way, approvals and permits once obtained);
•   acts of cybersecurity, sabotage or eco-terrorism that could cause significant damage or injury to eqm's personnel, assets or infrastructure or lead to extended interruptions of eqm's operations;
•   risks associated with eqm failing to properly balance supply and demand for its services, on a short-term, seasonal and long-term basis, which could result in eqm being unable to provide its customers, including us, with sufficient access to pipeline and other midstream infrastructure and water services as needed; and
•   risks associated with eqm's leverage and financial profile, which could result in eqm being financially deterred or prohibited from providing services to its customers, including us, on a timely basis or at all.
in addition, many of our midstream services contracts with eqm are "firm" commitments, under which we have reserved an agreed upon amount of pipeline or storage capacity with eqm regardless of the capacity that we actually use during each month, and we are generally obligated to pay a fixed, monthly charge, at an amount agreed upon in the contract. because these contracts involve significant long-term financial and other commitments on our part that lock us into prices at the time the contract is entered into, they could reduce our cash flow during periods of low prices for natural gas, ngls and oil when we may have lower volumes of natural gas and ngls and therefore less of a need for capacity and storage, or the market prices for such pipeline and storage capacity services may be lower than what we are contractually obligated to pay to eqm. further, although the new eqm gathering agreement provides for a reduced fee structure for the gathering and compression fees charged by eqm, this new fee structure does not take effect until the mountain valley pipeline's in-service date, which is currently expected to be january 1, 2021; however, there can be no assurance that the mountain valley pipeline's in-service date will not be delayed beyond such date, which would consequently delay the effective date of the fee reductions contemplated in the new eqm gathering agreement. neither equitrans midstream nor eqm is under any obligation to renegotiate their contracts with us in the event of a prolonged depressed commodity price environment or if the mountain valley pipeline's in-service date is delayed. our failure to obtain these services on competitive terms could materially harm our business.
negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, the explosion of natural gas transmission and gathering lines, oil spills, and concerns raised by advocacy groups or the media about hydraulic fracturing, greenhouse gas or methane emissions or fossil fuels in general, or about royalty payment and surface use issues, may lead to increased litigation and regulatory, legislative and judicial scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new local, state and federal laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations in safety, environmental, royalty and surface use areas. these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, challenged or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.
we are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.
our operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. laws, regulations and other legal requirements have increased the cost to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon wells and related infrastructure. our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including regulations related to the location of wells; the method of drilling, well construction, well stimulation, hydraulic fracturing and casing design; water withdrawal and procurement for well stimulation purposes; well production; spill prevention plans; the use, transportation, storage and disposal of water and other fluids and materials, including solid and hazardous wastes, incidental to natural gas and oil operations; surface usage and the reclamation of properties upon which wells or other facilities have been located; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the calculation, reporting and disbursement of royalties and taxes; and the gathering of production in certain circumstances.
our operations are also subject to conservation and correlative rights regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or field rule units; setbacks; the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit or in close proximity to other wells; drilling in the vicinity of coal mining operations and certain other structures; and the unitization or pooling of properties. some states allow the statutory pooling and unitization of tracts to facilitate development and exploration, as well as joint development of existing contiguous leases. in addition, state conservation and natural gas and oil laws generally limit the venting or flaring of natural gas and may set production allowances on the amount of annual production permitted from a well.
environmental, health and safety legal requirements govern discharges of substances into the air, ground and water; the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; the clean-up of contaminated sites; groundwater quality and availability; plant and wildlife protection; locations available for drilling; environmental impact studies and assessments prior to permitting; restoration of drilling properties after drilling is completed; and work practices related to employee health and safety.
to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. maintaining compliance with the laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business and any delays in obtaining related authorizations may affect the costs and timing of developing our natural gas, ngls and oil resources. these requirements could also subject us to claims for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. in addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. such costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. our failure to comply with the laws, regulations and other legal requirements applicable to our business, even if as a result of factors beyond our control, could result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties and damages as well as corrective action costs.
in december 2017, changes to certain federal income tax laws were signed into law that impact us, including but not limited to: changes to the regular income tax rate; the elimination of the alternative minimum tax; full expensing of capital equipment; limited deductibility of interest expense; and increased limitations on deductible executive compensation. the current administration continues to debate further changes to federal income tax laws that could be enacted, which could have a material impact on us. the most significant potential tax law changes include further changes to the regular income tax rate, the expensing of intangible drilling costs or percentage depletion, and further limited deductibility of interest expense, any of which could adversely impact our current and deferred federal and state income tax liabilities. state and local taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate or own assets may enact new taxes, such as the imposition of a severance tax on the extraction of natural resources in states in which we produce natural gas, ngls and oil, or change the rates of existing taxes, which could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and financial position.
in 2010, congress adopted the dodd-frank act, which established federal oversight and regulation of the otc derivative market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. the dodd-frank act required the cftc, the sec and other regulatory agencies to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation. as of the filing date of this annual report on form 10-k, the cftc had adopted and implemented many final rules that impose regulatory obligations on all market participants, including us, such as recordkeeping and certain reporting obligations. other rules that may be relevant to us or our counterparties have yet to be finalized. because significant rules relevant to natural gas hedging activities have not been adopted or implemented, it is not possible at this time to predict the full extent of the impact of the regulations on our hedging program, including available counterparties, or regulatory compliance obligations. we have experienced increased, and anticipate additional, compliance costs and changes to current market practices as participants continue to adapt to a changing regulatory environment.
federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of natural gas and oil wells, which could adversely affect our production.
we use hydraulic fracturing in the completion of our natural gas and oil wells. hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state natural gas and oil commissions, but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority. for example, the epa finalized rules in june 2016 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.
certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. in addition, congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. at the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. some states and municipalities have sought to ban hydraulic fracturing altogether. if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from constructing wells. see "business-regulation-environmental, health and safety regulation" for more information.
our operations may be exposed to significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities.
we may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration, development and production activities. these delays, costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and occupational health and workplace safety, including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become increasingly strict over time resulting in longer waiting periods to receive permits and other regulatory approvals. failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, and, in some instances, issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations.
strict, joint and several liabilities may be imposed under certain environmental laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. in addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental and occupational health and workplace safety impacts of our operations. we have been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation related to such matters.
in addition, new or additional laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing requirements or changes in enforcement policies could impose unforeseen liabilities, significantly increase compliance costs or result in delays of, or denial of rights to conduct, our development programs. for example, in june 2015, the epa and the corps issued a final rule under the cwa defining the scope of the epa's and the corps' jurisdiction over wotus, but several legal challenges to the rule followed, and the wotus rule was stayed nationwide in october 2015 pending resolution of the legal challenges. the epa and the corps proposed a rule in july 2017 to repeal the wotus rule and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the cwa's jurisdiction. in january 2018, the u.s. supreme court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the wotus rule resides with the federal district courts, which lifted the stay and resulted in a patchwork application of the rule in some states, but not in others. in october 2019, the epa issued a final rule repealing the wotus rule and the repeal rule became effective in december 2019. the repeal rule has already been challenged in federal district courts in new mexico, new york, and south carolina. in january 2020, the epa and the corps announced the final rule redefining the definition of wotus. the new definition narrows the scope of waters that are covered as jurisdictional. several groups have already announced their intention to challenge the rule. to the extent a stay of this rule or the implementation of a revised rule expands the scope of the cwa's jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. such potential regulations or litigation could increase our operating costs, reduce our liquidity, delay or halt our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, which in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. further, the discharges of natural gas, ngls, oil, and other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties.
regulations related to the protection of wildlife could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.
our operations can be adversely affected by regulations designed to protect various wildlife. the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in constraints on our exploration and production activities. this limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages. these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs.
conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for natural gas and oil.
fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to natural gas and oil, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for natural gas and oil. the impact of the changing demand for natural gas and oil could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and financial position.
climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the natural gas, ngls and oil that we produce while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa that, among other things, establish psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet "best available control technology" standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the epa on a case‐by‐case basis. these epa rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. in addition, the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil production sources in the united states on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. at the state level, several states including pennsylvania have proceeded with regulation targeting ghg emissions. such state regulations could impose increased compliance costs on our operations.
while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs, there has not been significant activity in the form of federal legislation in recent years. in the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing ghg emissions by means of cap-and-trade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those ghgs. in october 2019, pennsylvania governor tom wolf signed an executive order directing the padep to draft regulations establishing a cap-and-trade program under its existing authority to regulate air emissions, with the intent of enabling pennsylvania to join the rggi, a multi-state regional cap-and-trade program comprised of several eastern u.s. states. subsequently, legislators in the pennsylvania general assembly introduced a bill that, if approved, would require legislative approval by both chambers of the pennsylvania general assembly in order for pennsylvania to join the rggi. if pennsylvania ultimately becomes a member of the rggi, or otherwise implements a cap-and-trade program, it could result in increased operating costs if we are required to purchase emission allowances in connection with our operations.
on an international level, the united states is one of almost 200 nations that, in december 2015, agreed to the paris agreement, which calls for countries to set their own ghg emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its ghg emissions targets. the paris agreement was signed by the united states in april 2016 and entered into force on november 4, 2016; however, the paris agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants. in august 2017, the u.s. department of state officially informed the united nations of the united states' intent to withdraw from the paris agreement. the paris agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in november 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of november 2020. the united states' adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the united states may reenter the paris agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of ghgs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations.
substantial limitations on ghg emissions could also adversely affect demand for the natural gas, ngls and oil we produce and lower the value of our reserves.
further, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector. moreover, activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbon-intensive activities. while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proposals, they could ultimately make it more difficult to engage in exploration and production activities.
finally, it should be noted that a number of scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts, and other extreme climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they have the potential to cause physical damage to our assets or affect the availability of water and thus could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. see "business-regulation-environmental, health and safety regulation" for more information.
entering into strategic transactions may expose us to various risks.
we periodically engage in acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions, including joint ventures. these transactions involve various inherent risks, such as our ability to obtain the necessary regulatory and third-party approvals; the timing of and conditions imposed upon us by regulators in connection with such approvals; the assumption of potential environmental or other liabilities; and our ability to realize the benefits expected from the transactions. in addition, various factors, including prevailing market conditions, could negatively impact the benefits we receive from these transactions. competition for transaction opportunities in our industry is intense and may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing transactions. joint venture arrangements may restrict our operational and corporate flexibility. moreover, joint venture arrangements involve various risks and uncertainties, such as committing us to fund operating and/or capital expenditures, the timing and amount of which we may have little or partial control over, and our joint venture partners may not satisfy their obligations to the joint venture. our inability to complete a transaction or to achieve our strategic or financial goals in any transaction could have significant adverse effects on our earnings, cash flows and financial position.
acquisitions may disrupt our current plans or operations and may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities. we may not achieve the intended benefits of our acquisition of rice energy inc.
successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future natural gas, ngls and oil prices, operating costs, production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities. these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. in addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. we do not inspect every well or lease that we acquire, and even when we inspect a well or lease we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise.
there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. we often assume certain liabilities, and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. at times, we acquire interests in properties on an "as is" basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties. in addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.
on november 13, 2017, we completed the acquisition of rice energy inc. (rice energy). there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate rice energy's assets or otherwise realize the expected benefits and synergies of the acquisition of rice energy.
changes in our business following the completion of recent significant transactions, including the acquisition of rice energy and the separation and distribution, and the reconstitution of our board of directors and executive management team following our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, may result in disruptions to our business and negatively impact our operations and our relationships with our customers and business partners.
over the last three years we have completed multiple significant transactions, including the acquisition of rice energy and the separation and distribution (defined and discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). additionally, our board of directors was substantially reconstituted at our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders followed by a change in the members of our executive management team. as a result of these events, our company and employees have experienced significant changes, including the departure of members of senior management, new leadership in significant roles, and employee re-assignments as well as a reduction in our workforce. the combination of these factors may materially adversely affect our operations. further, uncertainty related to our business following these significant changes may lead customers and other parties to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in their existing business relationships with us or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. these disruptions could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and prospects.
the separation and distribution may subject us to future liabilities.
in november 2018, we completed the separation and distribution, resulting in the spin-off of equitrans midstream, a standalone publicly traded corporation that holds our former midstream business.
pursuant to agreements we entered into with equitrans midstream in connection with the separation, we and equitrans midstream are each generally responsible for the obligations and liabilities related to our respective businesses. pursuant to those agreements, we and equitrans midstream each agreed to cross-indemnities principally designed to allocate financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business to us and those of equitrans midstream's business to it. however, third parties, including governmental agencies, could seek to hold us responsible for obligations and liabilities that equitrans midstream agreed to retain or assume, and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from equitrans midstream will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such obligations and liabilities, or that equitrans midstream will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. additionally, if a court were to determine that the separation or related transactions were consummated with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or resulted in equitrans midstream receiving less than reasonably equivalent value when it was insolvent, or that it was rendered insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due, then it is possible that the court could disregard the allocation of obligations and liabilities agreed to between us and equitrans midstream, impose substantial obligations and liabilities on us and void some or all of the separation-related transactions. any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
if there is a later determination that the distribution or certain related transactions are taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the irs private letter ruling and/or opinion of counsel are incorrect or for any other reason, significant liabilities could be incurred by us, our shareholders or equitrans midstream.
in connection with the separation and distribution, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution, together with certain related transactions, as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for u.s. federal income tax purposes, under sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(d) of the u.s. internal revenue code, as amended (the code), and certain other u.s. federal income tax matters relating to the distribution and certain related transactions. the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel are based on and rely on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of us and equitrans midstream, including those relating to the past and future conduct of us and equitrans midstream. if any of these representations, statements or undertakings is, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete, or if we or equitrans midstream breach any representations or covenants contained in any of the separation-related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel, we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel.
notwithstanding receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, the irs could determine on audit that the distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for u.s. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling was based are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel that are not covered by the ruling or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or equitrans midstream after the distribution further described below. an opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court, and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in such opinion of counsel. accordingly, notwithstanding receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel, there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge, we, equitrans midstream and our shareholders could be subject to material u.s. federal and state income tax liabilities. in connection with the separation, we and equitrans midstream entered into a tax matters agreement, which described the sharing of any such liabilities between us and equitrans midstream.
even if the distribution otherwise qualifies as generally tax-free under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, we, but not our shareholders, would be subject to material u.s. federal and state income tax liability under section 355(e) of the code if one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater interest, measured by either vote or value, in our stock or in the stock of equitrans midstream, excluding, for this purpose, the acquisition of stock of equitrans midstream by holders of our stock in the distribution, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. any acquisition of our stock or stock of equitrans midstream, or any predecessor or successor corporation, within two years before or after the distribution generally would be presumed to be part of a plan that includes the distribution, although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption under certain circumstances. additionally, equitrans midstream is subject to certain agreements entered into with us that restrict, within two years of the distribution, the ability of equitrans midstream to engage in certain corporate transactions without obtaining an advance ruling from the irs and our prior consent. the process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. notwithstanding the irs private letter ruling or any opinion of counsel described above, we or equitrans midstream may cause or permit a change in ownership of our stock or stock of equitrans midstream sufficient to result in a material tax liability to us.
we are a significant shareholder of equitrans midstream and the value of our investment in equitrans midstream may fluctuate substantially.
following the separation and distribution, we retained approximately 19.9% of the outstanding shares of equitrans midstream's common stock. on february 26, 2020, we entered into share purchase agreements with equitrans midstream to sell approximately 50% of our equity interest in equitrans midstream to equitrans midstream (the equitrans share exchange) in exchange for a combination of cash and fee relief under our gathering agreements with eqm. we currently own approximately 19.9% of the outstanding shares of equitrans midstream's common stock; following the closing of the equitrans share exchange, we will own approximately 9.95% of the outstanding shares of equitrans midstream's common stock. the value of our investment in equitrans midstream may be adversely affected by negative changes in its results of operations, cash flows and financial position, which may occur as a result of the many risks attendant with operating in the midstream industry, including loss of gathering and transportation volumes, the effect of laws and regulations on the operation of its business and development of its assets, increased competition, loss of contracted volumes, adverse rate-making decisions, policies and rulings by the ferc, pipeline safety rulemakings initiated or finalized by the department of transportation's pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration, delays in the timing of, or the failure to complete, expansion projects, lack of access to capital and operating risks and hazards.
we intend to dispose of our remaining interest in equitrans midstream through one or more divestitures of our shares of equitrans midstream's common stock. however, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to complete such disposition or as to the value we will realize. the occurrence of any of these and other risks faced by equitrans midstream could adversely affect the value of our investment in equitrans midstream.
future sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.
we may sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent public offerings. we may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities.
we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.
see item 7a., "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for further discussion of the company's exposure to market risks, including the risks associated with the company's use of derivative contracts to hedge commodity prices.
item 7.       management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item 8., "financial statements and supplementary data." for all periods prior to the separation and distribution, the results of operations of equitrans midstream are reflected as discontinued operations. the statements of consolidated operations for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 have been recast to reflect discontinued operations and include certain transportation and processing expenses in continuing operations that had previously been eliminated in consolidation. cash flows related to equitrans midstream are included in the statements of consolidated cash flows for all periods prior to the separation and distribution. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for amounts attributable to discontinued operations included in the statements of consolidated cash flows and statements of consolidated operations.
consolidated results of operations loss from continuing operations for 2019 was $1,222 million, $4.79 per diluted share, an improvement of $1,159 million compared to loss from continuing operations for 2018 of $2,381 million, $9.12 per diluted share. the variance was attributable primarily to lower impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill and higher dividends received on the company's investment in equitrans midstream, partly offset by lower income tax benefit and higher impairment and expiration of leases, unrealized loss on the company's investment in equitrans midstream and operating revenues.
see item 7., "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" included in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018, which is incorporated herein by reference, for discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2017.
see "sales volumes and revenues," "production-related operating expenses" and "other operating expenses" for discussions of items affecting operating income and "other income statement items" for a discussion of other income statement items. see "investing activities" under "capital resources and liquidity" for a discussion of capital expenditures.
average realized price reconciliation the following table presents detailed natural gas and liquids operational information to assist in the understanding of the company's consolidated operations, including the calculation of the company's average realized price ($/mcfe), which is based on adjusted operating revenues, a non-gaap supplemental financial measure. adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure used by the company's management to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to total operating revenues. see "reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures" for a reconciliation of adjusted operating revenues with total operating revenues, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap.
(c)   ngls, ethane and oil were converted to mcfe at a rate of six mcfe per barrel.
(d)   total natural gas and liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives, is also referred to in this report as adjusted operating revenues, a non-gaap supplemental financial measure.
non-gaap financial measures reconciliation the table below reconciles adjusted operating revenues, a non-gaap supplemental financial measure, with total operating revenues, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap. adjusted operating revenues (also referred to as total natural gas and liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives) is presented because it is an important measure used by the company's management to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. adjusted operating revenues as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of net marketing services and other. management uses adjusted operating revenues to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and, thus, excludes the impact of the often-volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement. adjusted operating revenues also excludes net marketing services and other because management considers these revenues to be unrelated to revenues from its natural gas and liquids production. net marketing services and other primarily includes the cost of, and recoveries on, pipeline capacity releases and revenues for gathering services. management further believes that adjusted operating revenues as presented provides useful information to investors for evaluating period-to-period earnings trends.
total operating revenues                                                          $4,416,484                      $4,557,868
net marketing services and other                                                      (8,436       )                 (40,940       )
adjusted operating revenues, a non-gaap financial measure                         $4,057,729                      $4,470,675
operating revenues:
sales of natural gas, ngls and oil                       $3,791,414                  $4,695,519                (19.3   )
net marketing services and other                              8,436                      40,940                (79.4   )
total operating revenues                                 $4,416,484                  $4,557,868                 (3.1   )
(b)   ngls, ethane and oil were converted to mcfe at a rate of six mcfe per barrel.
sales of natural gas, ngls and oil decreased for 2019 compared to 2018 due to a lower average realized price, partly offset by a 1.4% increase in sales volumes. excluding 2018 sales volumes related to the 2018 divestitures (discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements), sales volumes increased by 4.2% in 2019. average realized price decreased due to lower nymex and liquids prices and lower btu uplift, partly offset by higher cash settled derivatives. for 2019 and 2018, the company received $266.3 million and paid $224.8 million, respectively, of net cash settlements, including net premiums received, on derivatives not designated as hedges, which are included in average realized price but may not be included in operating revenues.
for 2019 the company recognized a gain on derivatives not designated as hedges of $616.6 million compared to a loss of $178.6 million for 2018. the gain for 2019 was related to increases in the fair market value of the company's nymex swaps and options due to decreases in nymex forward prices. the loss for 2018 was related primarily to settlements of nymex swaps and options and basis swaps, partly offset by decreases in nymex forward prices.
net marketing services and other decreased for 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of fewer capacity releases at lower capacity release rates on the tennessee gas pipeline and lower revenues from gathering services following the 2018 divestitures.
production-related operating expenses the following table presents information on the company's production-related operating expenses.
processing                                                            0.08                        0.11               (27.3   )
lease operating expenses (loe), excluding production taxes            0.06                        0.07               (14.3   )
operating expenses:
processing                                                         125,804                     165,718               (24.1   )
transportation and processing. gathering expense increased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to the sales volume mix between firm and volumetric gathering contracts. transmission expense increased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher costs associated with unreleased capacity on the tennessee gas pipeline, increased transmission capacity and rates contracted to move the company's natural gas out of the appalachian basin and higher volumetric charges, partly offset by lower firm capacity charges following the 2018 divestitures. processing expense decreased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower liquids sales volumes, which were driven by the 2018 divestitures, and decreased west virginia production.
production. loe decreased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the 2018 divestitures, partly offset by higher salt water disposal costs. excluding costs related to the 2018 divestitures, loe per mcfe was $0.05 in 2018. production taxes decreased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to (i) lower pennsylvania impact fees as a result of less wells spud and lower pricing, (ii) lower severance taxes as a result of decreased west virginia production and lower pricing and (iii) lower property taxes as a result of the 2018 divestitures.
selling, general and administrative. selling, general and administrative expense decreased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of lower personnel costs due to reductions in workforce, the $15 million charitable contribution made to the eqt foundation in 2018 and decreased long-term incentive compensation due to changes in the fair value of awards, partly offset by increased litigation expenses. long-term incentive compensation may fluctuate with changes in the company's stock price and performance conditions.
depreciation and depletion. production depletion decreased on an absolute and per mcfe basis for 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a lower depletion rate, partly offset by higher sales volumes. other depreciation and depletion decreased as a result of the 2018 divestitures.
other operating expenses impairment/ loss on sale/exchange of long-lived assets. during the fourth quarter of 2019 the company recorded impairment of long-lived assets of $1,124.4 million, of which $1,035.7 million was associated with the company's non-strategic assets located in ohio utica and $88.7 million was associated with the company's pennsylvania and west virginia utica assets. the impairment was due primarily to depressed natural gas prices and changes in the company's development strategy, including the company's contemplation of a potential asset divestiture of certain of its non-strategic exploration and production assets. during the third quarter of 2019, the company recorded a loss on exchange of long-lived assets of $13.9 million related to the asset exchange transaction (defined and discussed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). for 2018, the company recorded impairment/ loss on sale of long-lived assets of $2.7 billion related to the 2018 divestitures. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of 2019 and 2018 impairment tests and note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the 2018 divestitures.
amortization and impairment of intangible assets. during the third quarter of 2019, the company recognized impairment of intangible assets associated with non-compete agreements for former rice energy inc. executives who are now employees of the company. the impairment resulted in decreased amortization in the second half of 2019.
impairment of goodwill. during the fourth quarter of 2018, the company recognized impairment of goodwill because the company's single reporting unit's fair value was below its carrying value. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the 2018 goodwill impairment test.
impairment and expiration of leases. impairment and expiration of leases increased from $556.4 million for 2019 compared to $279.7 million for 2018 due primarily to impairment of leases located in non-strategic development areas that are not expected to be developed due to changes in the company's development strategy, which includes a renewed focus on a refined core operating footprint. to a lesser extent, impairment increased due to lease expirations, a majority of which were related to leases acquired in 2017 and 2016.
proxy, transaction and reorganization. proxy, transaction and reorganization expense increased for 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to reductions in workforce and other strategic alignment initiatives, which resulted in severance and other termination benefits of $74.1 million and contract termination fees of $22.1 million, as well as proxy costs recognized in the first half of 2019 of $19.3 million. prior period transaction costs were related to the rice merger (discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
other income statement items the company's investment in equitrans midstream is recorded at fair value, which is calculated by multiplying the closing stock price of equitrans midstream's common stock by the number of shares of equitrans midstream's common stock owned by the company. changes in fair value are recorded in unrealized loss on investment in equitrans midstream corporation in the statements of consolidated operations. the company's investment in equitrans midstream fluctuates with changes in equitrans midstream's stock price, which was $13.36 and $20.02 as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
interest expense decreased for 2019 compared to 2018 due to repayment of the $700 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 8.125% senior notes that matured on june 1, 2019 and decreased borrowings under the company's credit facility, partly offset by interest incurred on borrowings under the term loan facility.
see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income tax benefit.
outlook see item 1., "business."
impairment of oil and gas properties see "critical accounting policies and estimates" and note  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company's accounting policies and significant assumptions related to impairment of the company's oil and gas properties.
see item 1a., "risk factors - natural gas, ngls and oil price declines, and changes in our development strategy, have resulted in impairment of certain of our assets. future declines in commodity prices, increases in operating costs or adverse changes in well performance or additional changes in our development strategy may result in additional write-downs of the carrying amounts of our assets, including long-lived intangible assets, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in future periods."
capital resources and liquidity the statements of consolidated cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017 have not been restated for discontinued operations; therefore, the following discussion of operating, investing and financing activities includes cash flows of both continuing and discontinued operations through the separation and distribution. see note  to the consolidated financial statements for amounts attributable to discontinued operations included in the statements of consolidated cash flows.
although the company cannot provide any assurance, it believes cash flows from operating activities and availability under the revolving credit facility should be sufficient to meet the company's cash requirements inclusive of, but not limited to, normal operating needs, debt service obligations, planned capital expenditures and commitments for at least the next twelve months.
see item 7., "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" included in the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018, which is incorporated herein by reference, for discussion and analysis of operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2017.
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,852 million for 2019 compared to $2,976 million for 2018. the decrease was driven by cash provided by discontinued operations included in 2018 and lower cash operating revenues, partly offset by favorable timing of working capital payments and dividends received on the company's investment in equitrans midstream.
the company's cash flows from operating activities will be affected by movements in the market price for commodities. the company is unable to predict such movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing. refer to item 1a., "risk factors - natural gas, ngls and oil price volatility, or a prolonged period of low natural gas, ngls and oil prices, may have an adverse effect upon our revenue, profitability, future rate of growth, liquidity and financial position." for further information.
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities were $1,601 million for 2019 compared to $3,979 million for 2018. the decrease was due primarily to lower capital expenditures as a result of the company's change in strategic focus from production growth to capital efficiency and cash used for capital expenditures and capital contributions by discontinued operations included in 2018, partly offset by proceeds received from asset sales in 2018.
capital expenditures years ended december 31,
reserve development                                        $1,377                  $2,249

total cash capital expenditures                            $1,602                  $3,732
(a)   midstream infrastructure capital expenditures are presented as discontinued operations. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
(b)   represents the net impact of non-cash capital expenditures, including capitalized share-based compensation costs and the effect of timing of receivables from working interest partners and accrued capital expenditures. the impact of accrued capital expenditures includes the reversal of the prior period accrual as well as the current period estimate. the year ended december 31, 2018 included $14.4 million of measurement period adjustments for 2017 acquisitions.
financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities were $249 million for 2019 compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $859 million for 2018. for 2019, the primary uses of financing cash flows were net repayments of debt and credit facility borrowings, and the primary source of financing cash flows was net proceeds from borrowings on the term loan facility. for 2018, the primary source of financing cash flows was net proceeds from a debt offering by eqm midstream partners, lp (eqm), the company's former midstream affiliate, and the primary uses of financing cash flows were the repurchase and retirement of common stock, distributions to noncontrolling interests, net repayments of credit facility borrowings, eqm's acquisition of 25% ownership interest in strike force midstream llc, net cash transferred in connection with the separation and distribution, cash paid for dividends and taxes on share-based incentive awards.
on february 4, 2020, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of three cents per share, payable march 1, 2020 to the company's shareholders of record at the close of business on february 14, 2020.
on january 21, 2020, the company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.125% senior notes due february 1, 2025 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 7.000% senior notes due february 1, 2030 (together, the adjustable rate notes). the company used the net proceeds from the adjustable rate notes to repay $500 million aggregate principal amount of the company's floating rate notes and $500 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes and expects to use the remaining proceeds to repay or redeem other outstanding indebtedness, which may include all or a portion of the company's outstanding 4.875% senior notes due november 15, 2021. the adjustable rate notes have covenants that are consistent with the company's existing senior unsecured notes, with an additional interest rate adjustment provision that provides for adjustments to its interest rates based on credit ratings assigned by moody's, s&p and fitch to the adjustable rate notes. as a result of the s&p and fitch downgrades of the company's senior notes credit rating (discussed in section "security ratings and financing triggers"), the interest rate on the 6.125% senior notes increased to 6.875% and the interest rate on the 7.000% senior notes increased to 7.750%.
on february 3, 2020, the company's 2.50% senior notes and floating rate notes, each due october 1, 2020, were fully redeemed by the company at a redemption price of 100.446% and 100%, respectively, plus accrued but unpaid interest of $4.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively. this resulted in the payment of make whole call premiums of $2.2 million related to the 2.50% senior notes.
on february 12, 2020, the company announced its commencement of a cash tender offer (the tender offer) for up to $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.875% senior notes due 2021 (the 4.875% notes). consideration paid in the tender offer for
the 4.875% notes that are validly tendered on or prior to march 2, 2020, and accepted for purchase by the company, will be $1,020 per $1,000 principal amount, including an early tender premium of $30 per $1,000 principal amount. the settlement date for such notes is expected to be march 4, 2020. consideration paid in the tender offer for the 4.875% notes that are validly tendered after march 2, 2020 and on or prior to march 16, 2020, and accepted for purchase by the company, will be $990 per $1,000 principal amount. the settlement date for such notes is expected to be march 18, 2020. payments for the 4.875% notes purchased will also include accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the last interest payment date on the 4.875% notes up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date for such 4.875% notes accepted for purchase by the company.
the company may from time to time seek to repurchase its outstanding debt securities. such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the company's liquidity requirements, contractual and legal restrictions and other factors. additionally, the company plans to dispose of its remaining retained shares of equitrans midstream's common stock and use the proceeds to reduce the company's debt.
revolving credit facility the company primarily uses borrowings under its revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs, timing differences between capital expenditures and other cash uses and cash flows from operating activities, margin deposits on derivative instruments and collateral requirements on midstream services contracts. see section "security ratings and financing triggers" for further discussion of margin deposits and collateral requirements on the company's derivative instruments and midstream services contracts. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's credit facility.
security ratings and financing triggers the table below reflects the credit ratings and rating outlooks assigned to the company's debt instruments at february 26, 2020. the company's credit ratings and rating outlooks are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independent from any other rating. the company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of what is deemed investment grade.
rating service                                    senior notes   outlook moody's investors service (moody's)               ba1            negative standard &amp; poor's ratings service (s&amp;p)   bb+            negative fitch ratings service (fitch)                     bb             negative as of december 31, 2019, the company's senior notes were rated "baa3" by moody's, "bbb-" by s&p and "bbb-" by fitch, each with a "negative" outlook. in january 2020, moody's downgraded the company's senior notes credit rating to "ba1," and, in february 2020, s&p and fitch downgraded the company's senior notes rating to "bb+" and "bb," respectively. the company is not aware of any current plans of moody's, s&p or fitch to further downgrade its rating of the company's senior notes. further changes in credit ratings may affect the company's access to the capital markets, the cost of short-term debt through interest rates and fees under the company's lines of credit, the interest rate on the company's term loan facility and adjustable rate notes, the rates available on new long-term debt, the company's pool of investors and funding sources, the borrowing costs and margin deposit requirements on the company's derivative instruments and credit assurance requirements, including collateral, in support of the company's midstream service contracts, joint venture arrangements or construction contracts. margin deposits on the company's derivative instruments are also subject to factors other than credit rating, such as natural gas prices and credit thresholds set forth in the agreements between hedging counterparties and the company. as of february 26, 2020, the company had sufficient unused borrowing capacity under its credit facility, net of letters of credit, to satisfy any requests for margin deposit or other collateral that its counterparties would be permitted to request of the company pursuant to the company's derivative instruments and midstream services contracts in the event that moody's and s&p downgrade the company's credit rating two categories further. as of february 26, 2020, such margin deposit or other collateral amounts could be up to approximately $1.4 billion, inclusive of assurances posted of approximately $0.6 billion in the aggregate. see notes 4 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
the company's debt agreements and other financial obligations contain various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in default or event of default under the company's credit facility and term loan facility, mandatory partial or full repayment of the amounts outstanding, reduced loan capacity or other similar actions. the most significant covenants and events of default under the debt agreements relate to maintenance of a debt-to-total capitalization ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of other financial obligations and change
of control provisions. the company's credit facility and term loan facility each contain financial covenants that require the company to have a total debt-to-total capitalization ratio no greater than 65%. the calculation of this ratio excludes the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income. as of december 31, 2019, the company was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants.
see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the borrowings under the company's credit facility and term loan facility.
commodity risk management the substantial majority of the company's commodity risk management program is related to hedging sales of the company's produced natural gas. the company's overall objective in its hedging program is to protect cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices. the derivative commodity instruments currently used by the company are primarily swap, collar and option agreements. during the third quarter of 2019, the company terminated certain otc hedge positions related to years 2021 and onward. the value associated with these terminated positions was rolled into new hedge positions with the same counterparties for 2020. no cash was exchanged related to these terminations or the associated execution of new hedge positions.
the following table summarizes the approximate volumes and prices of the company's nymex hedge positions through 2023 as of february 25, 2020.
(b)   the difference between the fixed price and nymex price is included in average differential presented in the company's price reconciliation in the "average realized price reconciliation." the fixed price natural gas sales agreements can be physically or financially settled.
for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the company has natural gas sales agreements for approximately 13 mmdth, 18 mmdth, 18 mmdth, 79 mmdth and 11 mmdth, respectively, that include average nymex ceiling prices of $3.68, $3.17, $3.17, $2.84 and $3.21, respectively. the company also has derivative instruments to hedge basis. the company may use other contractual agreements to implement its commodity hedging strategy.
see item 7a., "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" and note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company's hedging program.
off-balance sheet arrangements see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company's guarantees.
schedule of contractual obligations the following table presents the company's long-term contractual obligations as of december 31, 2019.
operating lease obligations (e)                        62,603                  30,488                 17,685                   14,402         28
(a)   purchase obligations are primarily commitments for demand charges under existing long-term contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines, some of which extend up to 20 years or longer. the company has entered into agreements to release some of its capacity. purchase obligations also include commitments for processing capacity in order to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream. purchase obligations excludes the new eqm gathering agreement signed on february 26, 2020.
(b)   see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company's january 2020 senior notes issuance and february 2020 repayment of the company's 2.50% senior notes and floating rate notes, which were both due in 2020.
(e)   see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company's operating lease obligations.
(f)   other liabilities are primarily commitments for estimated payouts for various liability stock award plans as of december 31, 2019. see "critical accounting policies and estimates" and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations.
as discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the company had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits at december 31, 2019 of $259.6 million, of which $113.7 million is offset against deferred tax assets for alternative minimum tax (amt) and general business tax credit carryforwards and net operating losses (nols). the company is currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities; therefore, this amount has been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.
commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the company. while the amounts claimed may be substantial, the company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. the company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. the company has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, the company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the company will not materially affect the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company's commitments and contingencies. see item 3., "legal proceedings."
recently issued accounting standards the company's recently issued accounting standards are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company's significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. management's discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based on the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the following critical accounting policies, which were
reviewed by the audit committee of the company's board of directors (the audit committee), relate to the company's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ from those estimates.
accounting for oil and gas producing activities. the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities.
the carrying values of the company's proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. to determine whether impairment has occurred, the company compares estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows from its oil and gas properties to the carrying values of those properties. the estimated future cash flows used in the recoverability test are based on proved and, if determined reasonable by management, risk-adjusted probable reserves and assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions used by the company for internal planning and budgeting purposes, including, among other things, the intended use of the asset, anticipated production from reserves, future market prices for natural gas, ngls and oil adjusted for basis differentials, future operating costs and inflation. proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future undiscounted cash flows are written down to fair value, which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their fair value estimates.
capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated for recoverability on a prospective basis at least annually. indicators of potential impairment include changes due to economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy and historical experience. the likelihood of an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties increases as the expiration of a lease term approaches and drilling activity has not commenced. if the company does not intend to drill on the property prior to expiration of the lease or does not have the intent and ability to extend, renew, trade or sell the lease prior to expiration, impairment expense is recorded.
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the accounting for oil and gas producing activities is a "critical accounting estimate" because the evaluations of impairment of proved properties involve significant judgment about future events, such as future sales prices of natural gas and ngls, future production costs, estimates of the amount of natural gas and ngls recorded and the timing of recoveries. see "impairment of oil and gas properties" and note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's impairments of proved and unproved oil and gas properties.
oil and gas reserves. proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by sec regulation s-x rule 4-10, are those quantities of oil and gas that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
the company's estimates of proved reserves are reassessed annually using geological, reservoir and production performance data. reserve estimates are prepared by the company's engineers and audited by the company's independent engineers. revisions may result from changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, development plans, prices, operating costs, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the depletion rate calculation and the company's consolidated financial statements.
the company estimates future net cash flows from natural gas, ngls and crude oil reserves based on selling prices and costs using a twelve-month average price, which is calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the twelve-month period and, as such, is subject to change in subsequent periods. operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation. income tax expense is computed using future statutory tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits available under current laws related to oil and gas producing activities.
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to oil and gas reserves is a "critical accounting estimate" because the company must periodically reevaluate proved reserves along with estimates of future production rates, production costs and the timing of development expenditures. future results of operations and the strength of the company's consolidated balance sheet for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions. see "impairment of oil and gas properties" for additional information on the company's oil and gas reserves.
income taxes. the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
the company has recorded deferred tax assets principally resulting from federal and state nol carryforwards, an amt credit carryforward, other federal tax credit carryforwards, unrealized capacity contract losses, incentive compensation and investments in securities. the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets related to the federal and state nol carryforwards, the separate company state impact of the interest expense limitation imposed with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the tax cuts and jobs act) and the company's investment in equitrans midstream because the company believes it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will not be completely realized. the valuation allowance on the equitrans midstream investment relates to the state and part of the federal deferred tax asset as the fair value loss is not expected to be fully realized for tax purposes due to capital loss limitations. in january 2019, the irs announced that it would no longer subject amt refunds to sequestration; as such, the company reversed the related previously recorded valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2019. no other significant valuation allowances have been established as the company believes that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the company's income tax expense and net income in the period in which such a determination is made.
the company also estimates the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions as described in note 9 to the company's consolidated financial statements.
the company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are "critical accounting estimates" because the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets, the company exercises judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of the evidence, a valuation allowance is needed, including carrybacks, tax planning strategies, reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income. in making the determination related to uncertain tax positions, the company considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit. to the extent that an uncertain tax position or valuation allowance is established or increased or decreased during a period, the company must include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement. future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.
derivative instruments. the company enters into derivative commodity instrument contracts primarily to reduce exposure to commodity price risk associated with future sales of natural gas production.
the company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using quoted market prices, where available. if quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on models that use market-based parameters as inputs, including forward curves, discount rates, volatilities and nonperformance risk. nonperformance risk considers the effect of the company's credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty's credit standing on the fair value of assets. the company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to the company's or counterparty's credit rating and the yield on a risk-free instrument. the values reported in the consolidated financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results or as market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control, change.
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to derivative instruments are "critical accounting estimates" because the company's financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of the company's derivative instruments due to the volatility of both nymex natural gas prices and basis. future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.
contingencies and asset retirement obligations. the company is involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. the company records a liability for contingencies based on its assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. the company considers many factors in making these assessments, including historical experience and matter specifics. estimates are developed in consultation with legal counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results.
the company accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the timing and amount of settlement. for oil and gas wells, the fair value of the company's plugging and abandonment obligations is recorded at the time the obligations are incurred, which is typically at the time the wells are spud.
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to contingencies and asset retirement obligations are "critical accounting estimates" because the company must assess the probability of loss related to contingencies and the expected amount and timing of asset retirement obligations. in addition, the company must determine the estimated present value of future liabilities. future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions.
share-based compensation. the company awards share-based compensation in connection with specific programs established under the 2009, 2014 and 2019 long-term incentive plans. awards to employees are typically made in the form of performance-based awards, time-based restricted stock, time-based restricted units and stock options. beginning in january 2020, awards to directors are typically made in the form of restricted stock units that vest on the date of the company's annual meeting of shareholders following the date of grant.
restricted units and performance-based awards that are expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards. for liability awards, the company estimates, on the grant date and on each reporting date thereafter until vesting and payment, the fair value of the ultimate payout based on the expected performance through, and value of the company's common stock on, the vesting date. the company then recognizes a proportionate amount of the expense for each period in the company's consolidated financial statements over the vesting period of the award. the company reviews assumptions regarding performance and common stock value on a quarterly basis and adjusts its accrual when changes to these assumptions result in a material change in the fair value of the ultimate payouts.
performance-based awards that are expected to be satisfied in company common stock are treated as equity awards. for equity awards, the company determines the grant date fair value of the awards, which is then recognized as expense in the company's consolidated financial statements over the vesting period of the award. determination of the grant date fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding, among other things, the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. most often, the company is required to obtain a valuation based on assumptions regarding risk-free rates of return, dividend yields, expected volatilities and the expected term of the award. the risk-free rate is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the company's common stock adjusted for any expected changes and, where applicable, the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant. expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company's common stock and, where applicable, the common stock of the peer group members at the time of grant. the expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period.
for time-based restricted stock awards, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as expense in the company's consolidated financial statements over the vesting period, which, historically, has been three years. for director restricted stock units expected to be satisfied in equity, the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as an expense in the company's consolidated financial statements in the year of grant. the grant date fair value, in both cases, is determined based on the closing price of the company's common stock on the date of the grant.
for non-qualified stock options, the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the company's consolidated financial statements over the vesting period, which, historically, has been three years. the company uses the black-scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, which includes assumptions for a risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility factor and expected term. the risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the dividend yield is based on the dividend yield of the company's common stock at the time of grant. the expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company's common stock at the time of grant. the expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical option exercise experience at the time of grant.
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to share-based compensation are "critical accounting estimates" because they may change from period-to-period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards, including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the company's common stock. future results of operations for any quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company's assumptions. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company's share-based compensation plans.

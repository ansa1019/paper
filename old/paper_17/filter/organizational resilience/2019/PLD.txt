item 1a. risk factors our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including but not limited to, our financial position, results of operations, cash flow, ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities. these risks relate to prologis as well as our investments in consolidated and unconsolidated entities and
include among others, (i) general risks; (ii) risks related to our business; (iii) risks related to financing and capital; and (iv) income tax risks.
general risks as a global company, we are subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in many countries.
we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the u.s. during 2019, we generated approximately $599 million or 18.0% of our revenues from operations outside the u.s. circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include, but are not limited to, the following factors:
•   difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations in certain geographies, including differing employment practices and labor issues;
•   local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices;
•   volatility in currencies and currency restrictions, which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the u.s.;
•   challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different geographies and to monitor compliance with applicable regulations, such as the foreign corrupt practices act, the united kingdom ("u.k.") bribery act and other similar laws;
•   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate;
•   the responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, e.g., with respect to corrupt practices, employment and licensing;
•   the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability, including government shutdowns, uncertainty in the u.k., or further withdrawals from the european union or other international trade alliances or agreements;
•   political instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities;
•   access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations.
in addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other factors.
disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
to the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets, this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect (i) the value of our properties; (ii) the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing; (iii) our ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance any outstanding debt when due; and (iv) the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases. disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders.
our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks.
despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, such as computer viruses or unauthorized access. any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business. we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions. any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.
risks associated with our dependence on key personnel.
we depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. from time to time, our personnel and their roles may change. while we believe that we are able to retain our key talent and find suitable employees to meet
our needs, the loss of key personnel, any change in their roles or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our business. if we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected.
our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.
the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. while management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities.
the depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
we hold significant real estate investments in international markets where the u.s. dollar is not the functional currency. at december 31, 2019, approximately $7.4 billion or 18.5% of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the u.s. dollar, principally the british pound sterling, euro and japanese yen. for the year ended december 31, 2019, $413 million or 17.2% of our total consolidated segment noi was denominated in a currency other than the u.s. dollar. as a result, we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the u.s. dollar. a significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our business and, specifically, our u.s. dollar reported financial position and results of operations.
our hedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk may not effectively limit our exposure to other risks.
we attempt to mitigate our risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we have significant investments thereby providing a natural hedge. we may also enter into derivative financial instruments that we designate as net investment hedges, as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments. we enter into other foreign currency contracts, such as forwards, to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flow associated with the translation of future earnings of our international subsidiaries. although we attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in foreign currency rates there can be no assurance that those attempts will be successful. hedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency or interest rates and the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. the funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of the hedged foreign currency or the size of the underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of the breakage. the failure to hedge effectively against foreign exchange changes or interest rate changes may adversely affect our business.
we are required to comply with many regulations in different countries, including (but not limited to) the foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar laws and regulations. our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as the americans with disabilities act and state and local fire and life-safety requirements. noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants. while we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us.
risks related to our business real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets, which may reduce economic returns to investors.
real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions. significant expenditures associated with real estate investments, such as secured mortgage debt payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments. as a reit, under the irc, we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable reit subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property. we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment to generate liquidity. if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale, we may not pursue such sales.
we may decide to sell or contribute properties to certain of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures or sell properties to third parties to generate proceeds to fund our capital deployment activities. our ability to sell or contribute properties on advantageous terms is affected by: (i) competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties; (ii) market conditions, including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties; and (iii) other factors beyond our control. if our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets, we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or at all. the unconsolidated co-investment ventures or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital, in the private and public markets, in order to acquire properties from us. should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms, then dispositions and contributions could be delayed.
if we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations, sales or contributions of properties or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting properties, whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term, at less than optimal terms, incurring debt, entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates. there can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us. additionally, taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business, and in particular, our distributable cash flow and debt covenants.
our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector.
our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector. this concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified.
general economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated, may impact financial results.
we are exposed to general economic conditions, local, regional, national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties. our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties.
at december 31, 2019, 35.0% of our consolidated operating properties or $11.2 billion (based on consolidated gross book value, or investment before depreciation) were located in california (central valley, san francisco bay area and southern california markets), which represented 28.6% of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 28.4% of our noi. our revenues from, and the value of, our properties located in california may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for logistics properties) and the local economic climate. business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact california's economic climate. because of the investment we have located in california, a downturn in california's economy or real estate conditions, including state income tax and property tax laws, could adversely affect our business.
in addition to california, we also have significant holdings (defined as more than 3% of total consolidated investment before depreciation) in operating properties in certain markets located in atlanta, central and eastern pennsylvania, chicago, dallas/fort worth, houston, new jersey/new york city, seattle and south florida. of these markets, no single market contributed more than 10% of our total consolidated investment before depreciation. our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties. conditions such as an oversupply of logistics space or a reduction in demand for logistics space, among other factors, may impact operating conditions. any material oversupply of logistics space or material reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business.
our o&m portfolio, which includes our wholly-owned properties and properties included in our co-investment ventures, has concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above, as well as in markets in france, germany, japan, mexico and the u.k., and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets.
a number of our investments, both wholly-owned and owned through co-investment ventures, are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. u.s. properties located in active seismic areas include properties in our markets in california and seattle. international properties located in active seismic areas include japan and mexico. we generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, if we believe it is commercially reasonable. we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self-insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis. we have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for our assets in japan based on this analysis.
furthermore, a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane or flood risk. we carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, if we believe it is commercially reasonable. we evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants.
investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business.
investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk. while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio, market research and our asset management capabilities, these risks cannot be eliminated. factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows include:
•   local conditions, such as oversupply or a reduction in demand;
•   technological changes, such as reconfiguration of supply chains, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 3d printing or other technologies;
•   the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers and competition from other available properties;
•   increasing costs of maintaining, insuring, renovating and making improvements to our properties;
•   our ability to rehabilitate and reposition our properties due to changes in the business and logistics needs of our customers;
•   our ability to control rents and variable operating costs; and
•   governmental regulations and the associated potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning, usage, tax, tariffs and other laws.
our customers may be unable to meet their lease obligations or we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire.
our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations. at december 31, 2019, our top 10 customers accounted for 15.2% of our ner. in the event of default by a significant number of customers, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord, and we may be unable to re-lease spaces. a customer may experience a downturn in its business, which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition, resulting in the customer's failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease. in addition, a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer's lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow.
we are also subject to the risk that, upon the expiration of leases they may not be renewed by existing customers, the space may not be re-leased to new customers or the terms of renewal or re-leasing (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers) may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire.
we may acquire properties that involve risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
we have acquired properties and will continue to acquire properties, through the direct acquisition of real estate and the acquisition of entities that own the real estate and through additional investments in co-investment ventures that acquire properties. the acquisition of properties involves risks, including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements identified in the pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates. when we acquire properties, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. additionally, there is, and it is expected there will continue to be, significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities. the acquired properties or entities may be subject to liabilities, including tax liabilities, which may be without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. as a result, if a liability were asserted against us based on ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we may have to pay substantial sums to settle it.
we may be unable to integrate the liberty and ipt operations successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits or do so within the anticipated timeframe.
we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the operations of liberty and ipt. potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following:
•   the inability to successfully integrate the operations of liberty and ipt in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from these transactions, which would result in the anticipated benefits not being realized in the timeframe currently anticipated or at all;
•   the inability to dispose of non-industrial assets or operations that are outside of our area of expertise;
•   potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with these transactions; and
•   performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing these transactions and integrating the companies' operations.
for all these reasons, it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our operations, services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of prologis to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of these transactions, or could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.
our real estate development strategies may not be successful.
our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through development of logistics facilities to hold for long-term investment, contribution or sale to a co-investment venture or third party, depending on market conditions, our liquidity needs and other factors. we may increase our investment in the development, renovation and redevelopment business and we expect to complete the build-out and leasing of our current development portfolio. we may also develop, renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed co-investment ventures. the real estate development, renovation and redevelopment business includes the following significant risks:
•   we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all;
•   we may explore development opportunities that may be abandoned and the related investment impaired;
•   we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations;
•   we may not be able to attract third-party investment in new development co-investment ventures or sufficient customer demand for our product;
•   we may have properties that perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts;
•   we may seek to sell certain land parcels and not be able to find a third party to acquire such land or the sales price will not allow us to recover our investment, resulting in impairment charges;
•   we may not be able to lease properties we develop on favorable terms or at all;
•   we may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced value created by our value-added properties on expected timetables or at all;
•   we may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if there is public or government opposition to our activities; and
•   we may have substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment activities, regardless of their ultimate success, that require a significant amount of management's time and attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day operations.
we are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming co-investment ventures, investing in new or existing co-investment ventures, attracting third-party investment and managing properties through co-investment ventures.
at december 31, 2019, we had investments in co-investment ventures, both public and private, that owned operating properties with a gross book value of approximately $41 billion. our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in these ventures, and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through co-investment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new co-investment ventures, or attract third-party investment or that additional investments in new or existing ventures to develop or acquire properties will be successful. further, there can be no assurance that we are able to realize value from such investments.
our co-investment ventures involve certain additional risks that we do not otherwise face, including:
•   our partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions made on behalf of the ventures;
•   if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions, then we may choose to contribute such capital;
•   our partners might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the property;
•   the venture or other governing agreements often restrict the transfer of an interest in the co-investment venture or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms;
•   our relationships with our partners are generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event, we may not continue to manage or invest in the assets underlying such relationships resulting in reduced fee revenues or obtaining direct ownership of the properties through acquisition; and
•   disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable co-investment venture to additional risk.
we generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our co-investment ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives; however, we may not be able to continue to do so indefinitely. we have formed publicly traded investment vehicles, such as npr and fibra prologis, for which we serve as sponsor or manager. we have contributed, and may continue to contribute, assets into such vehicles. there is a risk that our managerial relationship may be terminated.
we are exposed to various environmental risks, which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition.
under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner, developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances. the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances. in addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination.
environmental laws in some countries, including the u.s., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. some of our properties are known to contain asbestos-containing building materials.
in addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. furthermore, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. from time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions for which we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. in connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties.
we are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change, which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition.
we are also exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. our logistics facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, fires or floods. if the frequency of extreme weather events increases, our exposure to these events could increase. we do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change, as the operation of our buildings typically does not generate a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions. however, we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain or stricter energy efficiency standards or greenhouse gas regulations for the commercial building sectors. we cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future. the potential impacts of future climate change on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral.
we and our unconsolidated co-investment ventures carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance, as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located. the insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties, business activities and markets. we believe our properties and the properties of our co-investment ventures are adequately insured. certain losses, however, including losses from floods, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots, generally are not insured against or not fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property.
furthermore, we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our business.
risks related to financing and capital we may be unable to refinance our debt or our cash flow may be insufficient to make required debt payments.
we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness, that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness, or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness. if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted and, if the maturing debt is secured, the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness. our credit facilities and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates. increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements.
covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition.
the terms of our various credit agreements, including our credit facilities, the indentures under which our senior notes and term loans are issued and other note agreements, require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage ratio, leverage ratios, fixed charge coverage ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage. these covenants may limit our flexibility to run our business, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness. if we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default, refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations, our business and financial condition generally and, in particular, the amount of our distributable cash flow could be adversely affected.
adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity.
at december 31, 2019, our credit ratings were a3 from moody's and a- from s&p, both with stable outlook. a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.
the credit ratings of our senior notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. also, a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our credit facilities and other debt instruments. adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity.
the financial conduct authority ("fca"), the authority that regulates the london inter-bank offered rate ("libor"), announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 which will require transition to an alternative reference rate that could have a negative impact on our required debt payments and the value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments.
in july 2017, the fca announced it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. as a result, in the u.s., the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york identified the secured overnight financing rate as its preferred alternative rate for usd libor in debt and derivative financial instruments. additionally, other global regulators have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify a preferred alternative rate for other interbank offered rates ("ibors").
we have variable-rate debt of $2.0 billion at december 31, 2019 that are indexed to libor, cdor and yen libor (herein referred to as "ibor-indexed"). our loan documents contain provisions that contemplate alternative methods to determine the base rate applicable to our ibor-indexed debt to the extent ibor-indexed rates are not available. additionally, no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered under our loan documents in the event that the ibor-indexed rates are not available. if a contract is not transitioned to a preferred alternative rate and ibor-indexed rates are discontinued, the impact on our debt and derivative financial instruments is likely to vary by contract. if ibor-indexed rates are discontinued or if the methods of calculating the rates change, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. while we currently expect ibor-indexed rates to be available until the end of 2021, it is possible that they will become unavailable prior to that time.
we anticipate managing the transition to a preferred alternative rate using the language set out in our agreements and through potentially modifying our debt and derivative instruments, however future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and we may incur significant associated costs in doing so. we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on our debt payments and value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments, however, we are not able to predict when ibor-indexed rates will cease to be available.
in order to meet reit distribution requirements we may need access to external sources of capital.
to qualify as a reit, we are required each year to distribute at least 90% of our reit taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) to our stockholders and we may be subject to tax to the extent our taxable income is not fully distributed. historically, we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our
stockholders, however, we may elect to pay a portion of the distribution in shares of our stock. assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on third-party sources of capital. furthermore, to maintain our reit status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. these short-term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, the market's perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities.
our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock or units in the op.
any additional future issuance of common stock or op units will reduce the percentage of our common stock and units owned by investors. in most circumstances, stockholders and unitholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock or units. in addition, depending on the terms and pricing of any additional offering of our common stock or units and the value of the properties, our stockholders and unitholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock or units.
income tax risks the failure of prologis, inc. to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences.
prologis, inc. elected to be taxed as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the irc commencing with the taxable year ended december 31, 1997. we believe prologis, inc. has been organized and operated to qualify as a reit under the irc and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the irc to enable prologis, inc. to continue to qualify as a reit. however, it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow prologis, inc. to qualify as a reit, or that our future operations could cause prologis, inc. to fail to qualify. qualification as a reit requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some annually and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the irc for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. for example, to qualify as a reit, prologis, inc. must derive at least 95% of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources. in addition, prologis, inc. must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. historically, we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, but we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, our own stock. the provisions of the irc and applicable treasury regulations regarding qualification as a reit are more complicated for prologis, inc. because we hold substantially all of our assets through the op.
if prologis, inc. fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax (including, for taxable years prior to 2018, any applicable alternative minimum tax) on taxable income at regular corporate rates. unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, prologis, inc. would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it lost the qualification and would be subject to corporate tax on built-in gains that exist at the time of reit re-election if recognized within the five-year period after re-election, and potentially 10 years for certain states. if prologis, inc. lost its reit status, our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. in addition, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. accordingly, funds available for investment, operations and distributions would be reduced.
furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits that elected to be taxed as reits under sections 856 through 860 of the irc. provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit, our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests, and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit 95% and 75% gross income tests. to qualify as a reit, the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements. if such subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit, and certain relief provisions did not apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to u.s. federal income tax. in addition, a failure of the subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit would have an adverse effect on the ability of prologis, inc. to comply with the reit income and asset tests, and thus its ability to qualify as a reit.
in addition, we may acquire properties through the acquisition of reit entities that own the real estate. if a gain in such assets is not otherwise recognized by the seller or target in such acquisitions, and such entities were to fail to satisfy the reit requirements for any year, they would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the reit qualification was lost and the acquired assets would be subject to corporate tax on built-in gains that exist at the time of reit re-election or, if earlier, at the time of prologis' acquisition of the assets. a sale of such assets within the 5-year recognition period, and potentially 10 years for certain states, could result in corporate tax liabilities that could be significant.
from time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including by contributing properties to our co-investment ventures. under the irc, any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. we do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. however, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. the internal revenue service ("irs") may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. while we believe that the irs would not prevail in any such dispute, if the irs were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. in addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit.
in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the u.s., state, local and foreign income tax laws applicable to investments in real estate, reits, similar entities and investments. additional changes are likely to continue to occur in the future, both in and outside of the u.s. and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders. any increases in tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes.
complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.
our use of taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss") enables us to engage in non-reit qualifying business activities. under the irc, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other non-qualifying assets. this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-qualifying assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss, and to that extent limit our opportunities.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data of this report and the matters described under item 1a. risk factors.
a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018 is presented below. information on 2017 is included in graphs only to show year over year trends in our results of operations. our financial condition for 2017 and results of operations for 2017 and 2018 compared to 2017 can be found under item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which is incorporated by reference herein to our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2018, filed with the sec on february 13, 2019, and is available on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and our investor relations website at www.ir.prologis.com.
management's overview summary of 2019
during the year ended december 31, 2019, operating fundamentals remained strong for our o&m portfolio. our occupancy decreased to 96.5% at december 31, 2019 as compared to 97.5% at december 31, 2018 due to our focus on rental rate growth as evidenced by our weighted average net effective rent change of 23.7% in our o&m portfolio during 2019.
in 2019, we completed the following significant activities as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements:
•   in january, we formed pblv, a brazilian unconsolidated co-investment venture, with one partner. we contributed an initial portfolio of real estate properties to pblv consisting of 14 operating properties totaling 7 million square feet and 371 acres of land. we received total proceeds of $620 million, including cash and units, which represents a 20% equity interest.
•   excluding the contribution to pblv, we generated net proceeds of $2.4 billion and realized net gains of $719 million, primarily from the contribution of properties to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures in europe, japan and the u.s.
•   in february, we redeemed a portion of our investment in a european unconsolidated co-investment venture for proceeds of €278 million ($313 million).
•   in december, we formed pcclf, an unconsolidated co-investment venture investing in properties in china, with eight partners. at that time, we and our existing partner in prologis china logistics venture i, lp received equity interests in pcclf for the contribution of the existing portfolio of assets consisting of 79 properties totaling 22 million square feet. the seven new partners contributed cash, which was used to redeem a portion of our existing partner's investment in pcclf. we maintained our ownership percentage in these assets subsequent to the contribution and therefore did not recognize a gain.
•   we earned promotes aggregating $181 million ($121 million net of related expenses), of which $166 million was recorded in strategic capital revenues, primarily from pelf, and $15 million was recorded in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.
•   in january, we also entered into two unsecured japanese yen term loans for a total of ¥15.0 billion ($137 million) that bear interest of yen libor plus 0.5% to 0.6% and mature in january 2028 and 2030.
•   in march, we entered into an unsecured japanese yen term loan agreement (the "march 2019 yen term loan") under which we can draw japanese yen in an aggregate amount not to exceed ¥85.0 billion ($783 million at december 31, 2019). the march 2019 yen term loan bears interest at yen libor plus 0.4% and matures in march 2026. we used the proceeds to repay the majority of the outstanding balance of ¥100.0 billion ($897 million) on our 2016 japanese yen term loan.
•   in march, we also completed a private placement for ¥10.0 billion ($91 million) of senior notes with a stated interest rate of 1.2%, maturing in march 2039.
•   in september, we issued three series of senior notes for a total of €1.8 billion ($2.0 billion), bearing a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 0.7% and maturing in september 2027 through 2049. we utilized the proceeds to pay off senior notes of €600 million ($656 million) bearing an interest rate of 1.4% and maturing in october 2020 and $499 million on our multi-currency term loan.
•   at december 31, 2019, we had $3.7 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and total liquidity of $4.8 billion, including unrestricted cash balances.
•   on january 3rd, we redeemed €400 million ($446 million) of senior notes bearing a floating rate of euribor plus 0.3%.
•   on january 8th, our two u.s. co-investment ventures acquired the wholly-owned real estate assets of ipt for approximately $4 billion (our investment was approximately $1.6 billion). see notes 5 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on this transaction.
•   on february 4th, we completed the liberty transaction for approximately $13 billion through the issuance of equity and the assumption of debt. see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on this transaction.
results of operations we evaluate our business operations based on the noi of our two operating segments: real estate operations and strategic capital. noi by segment is a non-gaap performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements. we consider noi by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our operating results.
below is a reconciliation of our noi by segment to operating income per the consolidated financial statements (in millions). each segment's noi is reconciled to a line item in the consolidated financial statements in their respective segment discussions below.
strategic capital - noi                                                       307                  249

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments and a reconciliation of each business segment's noi to operating income and earnings before income taxes.
real estate operations this operating segment principally includes rental revenue and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties. we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses and the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios. the operating fundamentals in the markets in which we operate continue to be strong, which has increased rents and kept occupancies high. in addition, this segment is impacted by our development, acquisition and disposition activities.
below are the components of real estate operations revenues, expenses and noi (in millions), derived directly from the consolidated financial statements.
development management and other revenues                6                    9
(1)   as disclosed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, under the new lease standard, we adopted the practical expedient to present rental revenue and rental recoveries as a single component under rental revenues in our consolidated statements of income.
the change in real estate operations noi in 2019 compared to 2018 was impacted by the following items (dollars in millions):
(1)   acquisition activity increased noi in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of dct industrial trust inc. and dct industrial operating partnership lp (collectively "dct"), which was completed for $8.5 billion on august 22, 2018 ("dct transaction").
(2)   during both years, we experienced positive rental rate growth. rental rate growth (or rent change) is a combination of the rollover of existing leases to higher rental rates and contractual rent increases on existing leases. if a lease has a contractual rent increase driven by a metric that is not known at the time the lease commences, such as the consumer price index or a similar metric, the rent increase is not included in rent leveling and therefore, impacts the rental revenue we recognize. we experienced an increase in ner change from 29.4% in 2018 to 32.8% in 2019, that was marginally reduced by a decrease in average occupancy of 0.6% during the same period. see below for key metrics on rent change on rollover and occupancy for the consolidated operating portfolio.
(3)   we calculate changes in noi from development completions period over period by comparing the change in noi generated on the pool of developments that completed on or after january 1, 2018 through december 31, 2019 year over year.
(4)   other activity decreased noi in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to internal costs of $25 million related to leasing activities, partially reduced by lower non-recoverable expenses, both in 2019, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. beginning in 2019 with the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, we no longer capitalize internal costs related to our leasing activities.
below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio.
(1)   in august 2018, we completed the dct transaction and acquired a portfolio of logistics real estate assets aggregating 68 million square feet.
(2)   consolidated square feet of leases commenced and weighted average net effective rent change were calculated for leases with initial terms of one year or greater.
development activity the following table summarizes consolidated development activity (dollars and square feet in millions):
number of new development projects during the period                     74                  67
percentage of build-to-suits based on tei                              44.0   %            40.8   %
number of development projects stabilized during the period              72                  60
at december 31, 2019, our consolidated development portfolio, including properties under development and prestabilized properties with a tei of $4.0 billion, was 50.0% leased and expected to be completed before december 2021. for additional information on our development portfolio at december 31, 2019, see item 2. properties.
capital expenditures we capitalize costs incurred in renovating and improving our operating properties as part of the investment basis or within other assets. the following graph summarizes our total capital expenditures, excluding development costs, and property improvements per average square foot of our consolidated operating properties during each year:
(1)   in 2019, total capital expenditures increased primarily due to a larger portfolio and leasing our operating properties at higher rental rates and longer lease terms.
strategic capital this operating segment includes revenues from asset and property management, other fees for services performed and promote revenue earned from the unconsolidated entities. revenues associated with the strategic capital segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, the fair value of the properties and other transactional activity including foreign currency exchange rates and timing of promotes. these revenues are reduced by the direct costs associated with the asset and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures. we allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the strategic capital segment through strategic capital expenses and to the real estate operations segment through rental expenses based on the square footage of the relative portfolios.
below are the components of strategic capital revenues, expenses and noi, derived directly from the consolidated financial statements (in millions):
strategic capital revenues            $492                $406
strategic capital expenses            (185   )            (157   )
strategic capital - noi               $307                $249
below is additional detail of our strategic capital revenues, expenses and noi (in millions):
strategic capital revenues ($)
total strategic capital revenues ($)            86                75                41                32               284               175                81               124                492                406
strategic capital expenses ($)                 (97   )           (70   )           (14   )           (12   )           (38   )           (39   )           (36   )           (36   )           (185   )           (157   )
strategic capital - noi ($)                    (11   )             5                27                20               246               136                45                88                307                249
(1)   the u.s. expenses include compensation, personnel costs and ppp awards for employees who were based in the u.s. but also support other geographies.
(2)   recurring fees include asset and property management fees.
(3)   transactional fees include leasing commission, acquisition, development and other fees.
(4)   we generally earn promote revenue directly from third-party investors in the co-investment ventures and occasionally from the venture. the promote is generally based on cumulative returns over a three-year period. under either structure, when the promote is earned we recognize the third-party investors' share of the promote. approximately 40% of the promote earned by us is paid to our employees as a combination of cash and stock awards pursuant to the terms of the ppp and expensed through strategic capital expenses, as vested.
operating properties             605                566                  214                 209                  731                 669                  144                125               1,694               1,569
(1)   pblv and our other brazilian joint ventures are combined as one venture for the purpose of this table.
(2)   in december, we formed pcclf, an unconsolidated co-investment venture investing in properties in china, with eight partners. at that time, we and our existing partner in prologis china logistics venture i, lp contributed the existing portfolio of assets to pcclf.
see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
we capitalize certain internal costs, including salaries and related expenses, directly related to our development activities. we previously capitalized g&a related to our internal leasing activities, however, beginning january 1, 2019 these costs were expensed and recorded to rental expenses in the consolidated statements of income.
the following table summarizes capitalized g&a amounts (in millions):
building and land development activities                                                          $68               $63
operating building improvements and other                                                          20                16
total capitalized g&amp;a expenses                                                                $88              $100
capitalized salaries and related costs as a percent of total salaries and related costs          19.5   %          24.5   %
the following table highlights the key changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2019 as compared to 2018 (dollars in millions):
(1)   the acquisition of properties primarily includes the dct transaction through which we acquired operating properties and the related intangible assets in the third quarter of 2018. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the dct transaction.
gains on real estate transactions, net the following table summarizes our gains on dispositions of development properties and land, net and gains on other dispositions of investments in real estate, net, which includes sales of non-developed properties (primarily operating properties) and other real estate transactions, for the years ended december 31 (in millions):
gains on dispositions of development properties and land, net contributions to unconsolidated entities                                                       $403          $423
total gains on dispositions of development properties and land, net                            $468          $470
gains on other dispositions of investments in real estate, net contributions to unconsolidated entities                                                        $98           $36

total gains on other dispositions of investments in real estate, net                           $390          $371
we utilized the proceeds from these transactions primarily to fund our capital investments during both periods. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these transactions.
our owned and managed ("o&m") operating portfolio we manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an o&m basis, which includes properties wholly owned by us or owned by one of our co-investment ventures. we believe reviewing the fundamentals this way allows management to understand the entire impact to the financial statements, as it will affect both the real estate operations and strategic capital segments, as well as the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. we do not control the unconsolidated co-investment ventures for purposes of gaap and the presentation of the ventures' operating information does not represent a legal claim.
our o&m operating portfolio does not include our development portfolio, value-added properties, non-industrial properties or properties held for sale to third parties and was as follows at december 31 (square feet in millions):
number of properties               square           percentage occupied          number of properties               square           percentage occupied feet                                                                             feet consolidated                       1,882               359                          96.1   %                        1,835               348                          97.2   %
below are the key operating metrics summarizing the leasing activity of our o&m operating portfolio.
(1)   square feet of leases commenced and weighted average net effective rent change were calculated for leases with initial terms of one year or greater. we retained more than 70% of our customers, based on the total square feet of leases commenced, for each year.
increased, however, due to the longer terms and higher rents on leases commenced, this resulted in a lower cost as a percentage of lease value.
same store analysis our same store metrics are non-gaap financial measures, which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community, on both a net effective and cash basis. we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a "same store" analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, which allows us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations. we determine our same store metrics on property noi, which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest, as further defined below.
we define our same store population for the three months ended december 31, 2019 as the properties in our o&m operating portfolio, including the property noi for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures at january 1, 2018 and owned throughout the same three-month period in both 2018 and 2019. we believe the drivers of property noi for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the o&m portfolio based on prologis' ownership in the properties ("prologis share"). the same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period (january 1, 2018) and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. to derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period-end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the u.s. dollar, for both periods.
as non-gaap financial measures, the same store metrics have certain limitations as an analytical tool and may vary among real estate companies. as a result, we provide a reconciliation of rental revenues less rental expenses ("property noi") (from our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap) to our same store property noi measures.
we evaluate the results of our same store portfolio on a quarterly basis. the following is a reconciliation of our consolidated rental revenues, rental expenses and property noi for each quarter in 2019 and 2018 to the full year, as included in the consolidated statements of income and within note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and to the respective amounts in our same store portfolio analysis for the three months ended december 31 (dollars in millions):

(1)   we exclude properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. we also exclude net termination and renegotiation fees to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property's recurring operating performance. net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. same store property noi is adjusted to include an allocation of property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). on consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expense.
(2)   we include the property noi for the same store portfolio for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the co-investment ventures based on our investment in the underlying properties. in order to calculate our share of same store property noi from the co-investment ventures in which we own less than 100%, we use the co-investment ventures' underlying property noi for the same store portfolio and apply our ownership percentage at december 31, 2019 to the property noi for both periods, including the properties contributed during the period. we adjust the total property noi from the same store portfolio of the co-investment ventures by subtracting the third parties' share of both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
during the periods presented, certain wholly owned properties were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period). as a result, only line items labeled "prologis share of same store property noi" are comparable period over period.
(3)   we further remove certain noncash items (straight-line rent and amortization of fair value lease adjustments) included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap to reflect a same store property noi - cash measure.
we manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our o&m portfolio at 100% as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis. we calculate those results by including 100% of the properties included in our same store portfolio.
other components of income (expense)
earnings from unconsolidated entities, net we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities, which are accounted for using the equity method, of $200 million and $298 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. the decrease in earnings year over year was primarily due to significant gains recognized in 2018 on real estate dispositions in europe. the earnings we recognize can be impacted by: (i) variances in revenues and expenses of each venture; (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture; (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt; (iv) our ownership interest in each venture; and (v) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to u.s. dollars.
see the discussion of our unconsolidated entities above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.

net interest expense increased by $11 million, primarily due to higher average debt balances in 2019 as compared to 2018. the increase in debt year over year was due to the assumption of debt in the dct transaction in august 2018 that was mostly refinanced with debt at lower interest rates. additionally, we recognized a gain upon settlement of the interest rate swaps on the canadian term loan in 2018.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section, for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs.
foreign currency and derivative gains (losses), net we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. we recognize the change in fair value of the undesignated derivative contracts in unrealized gains and losses. upon settlement of these transactions, we recognize realized gains or losses.
we primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. we may also issue debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity and we generally designate the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge. we recognize the remeasurement and settlement of the unhedged portion of the debt and accrued interest in unrealized gains or losses. we also recognize the change in fair value and settlement of any undesignated derivative contracts to hedge the eventual payment of these borrowings in a foreign currency in unrealized gains or losses.
gains (losses) on the settlement of undesignated derivatives                                        $28               $(3   )

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our foreign currency and derivative financial instrument policies and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our derivative and nonderivative transactions.
losses on early extinguishment of debt, net we recognized a loss of $16 million and $3 million upon extinguishment of debt in 2019 and 2018, respectively. through our financing activities in both 2019 and 2018 we reduced our effective interest rate and lengthened the maturities of our debt. see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section, for more information regarding our debt repurchases.
income tax expense we recognize income tax expense related to our taxable reit subsidiaries and in certain local, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income.
deferred income tax expense (benefit) is generally a function of the period's temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries.

our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests this amount represents the third-party investors' share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100% of the equity, reduced by the third-party share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period. we had net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of $129 million and $174 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. included in these amounts were $47 million and $49 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, of net earnings attributable to the common limited partnership unitholders of prologis, l.p.

liquidity and capital resources overview we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions and dispositions of properties and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements.
near-term principal cash sources and uses in addition to dividends and distributions, we expect our primary cash needs may consist of the following:
•   completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio (at december 31, 2019, 105 properties in our development portfolio were 50.0% leased with a current investment of $1.9 billion and a tei of $4.0 billion when completed and leased, leaving $2.1 billion of estimated additional required investment);
•   development of new properties which we may hold for long-term investment or subsequently contribute to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, including the acquisition of land in certain markets;
•   capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio;
•   repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments of $536 million in 2020, of which $446 million of senior notes were redeemed in january 2020;
•   additional investments in current unconsolidated entities or new investments in future unconsolidated entities;
•   acquisition of operating properties or portfolios of operating properties, including the acquisition of ipt described above, (depending on market and other conditions) for direct, long-term investment in our consolidated portfolio (this might include acquisitions from our co-investment ventures); and
•   repurchase of our outstanding debt or equity securities (depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity, contractual restrictions and other factors) through cash purchases, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise.
we expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources (subject to market conditions):
•   fees earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures, including promotes;
•   proceeds from the disposition of properties, land parcels or other investments to third parties;
•   proceeds from the contributions of properties to current or future co-investment ventures;
•   proceeds from the sale of a portion of our investments in co-investment ventures to achieve long-term ownership targets;
•   borrowing capacity under our current credit facility arrangements, other facilities or borrowing arrangements ($3.7 billion available at december 31, 2019); and
•   proceeds from the issuance of debt.
we may also generate proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, subject to market conditions. in february 2020, we completed the liberty transaction for approximately $13 billion through the issuance of equity and the assumption of debt.

our credit ratings at december 31, 2019, were a3 from moody's and a- from standard & poor's, both with stable outlook. these ratings allow us to borrow at an advantageous rate. adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity. a securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization.
at december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. these covenants include customary financial covenants for total debt, encumbered debt and fixed charge coverage ratios.
see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our debt.
equity commitments related to certain co-investment ventures certain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. we may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash.

(1)   as discussed above, in december 2019 we formed pcclf with eight venture partners with initial equity commitments of ¥4,622 million ($657 million). at that time, we and our existing partner in prologis china logistics venture i, lp contributed the real estate portfolio to pcclf in exchange for equity interests. the contributions from the seven new partners were used to redeem a portion of our existing partner's investment in pcclf.
see the cash flow summary below for more information about our investment activity in the co-investment ventures.
net cash provided by operating activities                                                      $2,264           $1,804

currency exchange rates operating activities cash provided by operating activities, exclusive of changes in receivables and payables, was impacted by the following significant activities:
•   real estate operations. we receive the majority of our operating cash through the net revenues of our real estate operations segment. see the results of operations section above for further explanation on our real estate operations segment. the revenues from this segment include noncash adjustments for straight-lined rents and amortization of above and below market leases of $98 million and $67 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.
•   strategic capital. we also generate operating cash through our strategic capital segment by providing asset and property management and other services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. see the results of operations section above for the key drivers of the net revenues from our strategic capital segment. included in strategic capital revenues is the third-party investors' share that is owed for fees and promotes, which is recognized in operating activities in the period the cash is received.
•   g&amp;a expenses and equity-based compensation awards. we incurred $266 million and $239 million of g&amp;a costs in 2019 and 2018, respectively. included in these amounts are equity-based, noncash compensation expenses of $98 million and $76 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, which were recorded to rental expenses in the real estate operations segment, strategic capital expenses in the strategic capital segment and g&amp;a expenses.
•   operating distributions from unconsolidated entities. we received $347 million and $350 million of distributions from our unconsolidated entities in 2019 and 2018, respectively. certain unconsolidated co-investment ventures distribute the total promote, including our share, that is recorded to investment in and advances to unconsolidated entities and is included in operating activities in the period the cash is received.
•   cash paid for interest and income taxes, net. we paid combined amounts for interest and income taxes, net of amounts received, of $277 million and $266 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. see note 8 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on this activity.
cash provided by investing activities is driven by proceeds from contributions and dispositions of real estate properties, including the contribution of the initial portfolio of properties to pblv. cash used in investing activities is principally driven by our capital deployment activities of investing in real estate development, acquisitions and capital expenditures. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these activities. in addition, the following significant transactions also impacted our cash provided by or used in investing activities:
•   dct transaction, net of cash acquired. we paid net cash of $46 million to complete the dct transaction in 2018, primarily due to transaction costs. the acquisition was financed through the issuance of equity and assumption of debt. see notes 3 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on the dct transaction.
•   investments in and advances to. we invested cash in our unconsolidated entities that represented our proportionate share, of $276 million and $160 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. the ventures used the funds for the acquisition of properties, development and repayment of debt. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
•   return of investment. we received distributions from unconsolidated entities as a return of investment of $389 million and $360 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. included in these amounts were distributions from venture activities including proceeds from property sales, debt refinancing and the redemption of our investment in certain unconsolidated entities.
•   proceeds from repayment of notes receivable backed by real estate. we received $34 million for the repayment of notes received in connection with the disposition of real estate to third parties in 2018.
•   settlement of net investment hedges. we paid net cash of $7 million and received $18 million from the settlement of net investment hedges during 2019 and 2018, respectively. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative transactions.
our repurchase of and payments on debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt consisted of the following activity (in millions):
repurchase of and payments on debt (including extinguishment costs) (1)
proceeds from the issuance of debt secured mortgage debt                                                                $250              $229
(1)   we completed the dct transaction in 2018 and assumed $1.9 billion of debt, of which $1.8 billion was paid off with the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes. the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt was excluded from the table above.
off-balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated co-investment venture debt we had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, at december 31, 2019, of $5.9 billion. the ventures listed below had total third-party debt of $9.4 billion at december 31, 2019. certain of our ventures do not have third-party debt and are therefore excluded. this debt is non-recourse to prologis and other investors in the co-investment ventures and matures and bears interest as follows at december 31, 2019 (dollars in millions):
(1)   the weighted average loan-to-value ratio for all unconsolidated co-investment ventures was 26.0% at december 31, 2019. loan-to-value, a non-gaap measure, was calculated as the percentage of total third-party debt to the gross book value of real estate for each venture and weighted based on the cumulative gross book value of all unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
at december 31, 2019, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. in our role as the manager or sponsor, we work with the co-investment ventures to maintain sufficient liquidity and refinance their maturing debt. there can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. certain of our ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds.
unfunded commitments on the development portfolio (1)                      1,647                       454                         -                             -                 2,101

(1)   we had properties in our consolidated development portfolio (completed and under development) at december 31, 2019, with a tei of $4.0 billion. the unfunded commitments presented include not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under construction contracts, but all costs necessary to place the property into service, including the estimated costs of tenant improvements, marketing and leasing costs that we expect to incur as the property is leased.
(2)   beginning january 1, 2019, as a lessee we were required to record both a right-of-use asset and lease liability for our ground and office space leases based on the present value of our future minimum lease payments. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
distribution and dividend requirements our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the irc, relative to maintaining our reit status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund capital improvements and other investment activities.
under the irc, reits may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income.
we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.53 and $0.48 per common share in 2019 and 2018, respectively. our future common stock dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time,
including our financial condition, operating results and reit distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board during the year.
we make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend. the class a units in the op are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to $0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least $0.40 per unit. we paid a quarterly distribution of $0.64665 per class a unit in 2019 and 2018.
at december 31, 2019, we had 1.4 million shares of series q preferred stock outstanding with a liquidation preference of $50 per share. the annual dividend rate is 8.54% per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.
other commitments on a continuing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties.
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that involves an estimate or assumption that is subjective and requires management judgment about the effect of a matter that is inherently uncertain and material to an entity's financial condition and results of operations. management's best judgment considers historical and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. of the significant accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, those presented below have been identified by us as meeting the criteria to be considered critical accounting policies. refer to note 2 for more information on these critical accounting policies.
acquisitions we generally account for an acquisition of a single property or portfolio of properties as an asset acquisition. we measure the real estate assets acquired through an asset acquisition based on their cost or total consideration exchanged and any excess consideration or bargain purchase amount is allocated to the real estate properties, excluding those identified as held for sale, on a relative fair value basis.
we make estimates as part of our valuation of the assumed assets and liabilities at the acquisition date. the components of an acquisition typically include buildings, land, improvements, intangible assets or liabilities related to the acquired leases, debt, deferred tax assets and liabilities and other assumed assets and liabilities. the purchase price allocation is based on the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located utilizing an income approach methodology, which may be a discounted cash flow analysis or applying a capitalization rate to the estimated noi of a property. key assumptions include market rents, growth rates, and discount and capitalization rates. estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends and market and economic conditions. we determine discount and capitalization rates by market based on recent transactions and other market data. the fair value of land is generally based on relevant market data, such as a comparison of the subject site to similar parcels that have recently been sold or are currently being offered on the market for sale. the use of different assumptions to value the acquired properties and intangible assets and assumed liabilities could affect the future revenues and expenses we recognize over the estimated remaining useful life or lease term.
recoverability of real estate assets we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.
recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions and property-level operating results, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change. fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to the estimated noi of a property, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the property. assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, including market rents, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment.
new accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
ffo is a non-gaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings.
the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. we also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties' share of our consolidated co-investment ventures.
our ffo measures our ffo measures begin with nareit's definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. while not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo, as modified by prologis and core ffo, both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. these items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.
we calculate our ffo measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures. we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis. we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods.
these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. we do not use our ffo measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.
we analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities.
to arrive at ffo, as modified by prologis, we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically:
•   deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;
•   current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined ffo measure; and
•   foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from (i) debt transactions between us and our foreign entities, (ii) third-party debt that is used to hedge our investment in foreign entities, (iii) derivative financial instruments related to any such debt transactions, and (iv) mark-to-market adjustments associated with other derivative financial instruments.
we use ffo, as modified by prologis, so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the u.s.
•   gains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell;
•   income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate;
•   impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;
•   gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock; and
we use core ffo, including by segment and geographies, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results.
limitations on the use of our ffo measures while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures, neither nareit's nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. some of the limitations are:
•   the current income tax expenses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures represent the taxes and transaction costs that are payable.
•   depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from ffo. ffo is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in ffo.
•   gains or losses from non-development property dispositions and impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. by excluding these gains and losses, ffo does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.
•   the deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. our modified ffo measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.
•   the foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. the ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. our ffo measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.
•   the gains and losses on extinguishment of debt or preferred stock that we exclude from our core ffo, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our obligation at less or more than our future obligation.
we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions. this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap. to assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap as follows (in millions):

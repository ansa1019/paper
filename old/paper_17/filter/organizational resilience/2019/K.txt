item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition.
if we pursue strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.
from time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. with respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us, or achieve expected returns, expected synergies and other benefits as a result of integration challenges, or may not achieve those objectives on a timely basis. future acquisitions of foreign companies or new foreign ventures would subject us to local laws and regulations and could potentially lead to risks related to, among other things, increased exposure to foreign exchange rate changes, government price control, repatriation of profits and liabilities relating to the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act.
with respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges. companies or operations acquired or joint ventures created may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. our corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses, integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. future acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
the divestiture (the "divestiture") of selected cookie, fruit and fruit-flavored snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses, consummated on july 28, 2019 (the "divested business") may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits, the divestiture may adversely affect our business, and there are execution risks associated with our continued provision of transition services to the divested business.
we may not realize the benefits we expect from revenue growth management.
we are utilizing formal revenue growth management practices to help us realize price in a more effective way. this approach addresses price strategy, price-pack architecture, promotion strategy, mix management, and trade strategies. revenue growth management involves changes to the way we do business and may not always be accepted by our customers, consumers or third party providers causing us not to realize the anticipated benefits. in addition, the complexity of the execution requires a substantial amount of management and operational resources. these and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues and have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. any failure to execute revenue growth management in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial condition.
our results may be materially and adversely impacted as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, including agricultural commodities, fuel and labor.
agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, rice, potato flakes, vegetable oils, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are the principal packaging materials used by us. the cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due to government policy, regulation, and/or shutdown, import and export requirements (including tariffs), global geopolitical conditions, drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change) or other unforeseen circumstances. to the extent that any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of such commodities and we are unable to increase our prices or adequately hedge against such changes in prices in a manner that offsets such changes, the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected. in addition, we use derivatives to hedge price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials. our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date of purchase, resulting in an unfavorable impact on both gross margin and net earnings. also, sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay the higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share.
cereal processing equipment at major domestic and international facilities are regularly fueled by electricity, natural gas or propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. short-term stand-by propane storage exists at several plants for use in case of interruption in natural gas supplies. oil may also be used to fuel certain operations at various plants. in addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. the cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy, regulation and/or shutdown, war, or other unforeseen circumstances which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.
our results may be adversely affected by increases in transportation costs and reduced availability of or increases in the price of oil or other fuels.
we rely on trucking and railroad operators to deliver incoming ingredients to our manufacturing locations and to deliver finished products to our customers. shortages of truck drivers and railroad workers have contributed to increased freight costs, which has had a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in particular, compliance with the electronic device logging mandate has increased the cost of transportation for us and many other companies. transportation costs are further increasing as a result of high levels of long-haul driver turnover and increased railroad traffic and service issues. additionally, energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and, at times, have resulted in significant cost increases, particularly for the price of oil and gasoline. an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution and costs to purchase our products from suppliers. increases in transportation and energy and fuel costs has, and may continue to affect our profitability and may increase the cost of our products, which may reduce consumer demand.
a shortage in the labor pool, failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements, or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase labor cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition.
our labor costs include the cost of providing benefits for employees. we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states and various foreign locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, active health care, severance and other postemployment benefits. we also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain of our manufacturing locations. our major pension plans and u.s. collectively bargained retiree health and welfare plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of equity securities with smaller holdings of bonds, real estate and other investments. the annual cost of benefits can vary significantly from year to year and is materially affected by such factors as changes in the assumed or actual rate of return on major plan assets, a change in the weighted-average discount rate used to measure obligations, the rate or trend of health care cost inflation, and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements. many of our employees are covered by collectively-bargained agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collectively-bargained agreements. strikes or work stoppages and interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms, which could adversely impact our operating results. the terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency.
multiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business.
we participate in "multiemployer" pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees. we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make withdrawal liability payments, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. our withdrawal liability from a multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan's funding of vested benefits. in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan, and in that event, we could face a withdrawal liability. one of the multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have significant underfunded liabilities. such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability.
we withdrew from two multiemployer pension plans in 2019 and recorded an estimate of the related withdrawal liability. while this is our best estimate of the ultimate cost of withdrawing from the plans at this time, we have not yet reached agreement on the ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability. as a result, the actual cost could differ from our estimate based on final funding assessments.
we operate in the highly competitive food industry.
we face competition across our product lines, including snacks, ready-to-eat cereals and other convenience foods, from other companies which have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions. the principal aspects of our business where we face competition include brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space, navigating the growing e-commerce marketplace, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer and customer service. most of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources, and some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. our competition with other companies in our various markets and product lines could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, or lose category share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.
our ability to compete also depends upon our ability to predict, identify, and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences. there are inherent marketplace risks associated with new product or packaging introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance. if we do not succeed in offering products that consumers want to buy, our sales and market share will decrease, resulting in reduced profitability. if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be long-lasting, or are unable to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences, our sales will decline. in addition, given the variety of backgrounds and identities of consumers in our consumer base, we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences.
in some cases, our competitors may be able to respond to changing business and economic conditions or consumer preferences more quickly than us. category share and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products, anticipating changes in consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors or in effectively assessing, changing and setting proper pricing.
the changing retail environment and the growing presence of alternative retail channels, could negatively impact our sales and profits.
our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. our largest customer, wal-mart stores, inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated net sales during 2019, comprised principally of sales within the united states. no other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2019. during 2019, our top five customers, collectively, including wal-mart, accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 50% of u.s. net sales. there can be no assurances that our largest customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past. as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and retailers become larger, our large retail customers have sought, and may continue to seek in the future, to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms. in addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own private label products. if we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected. the loss of any large customer or severe adverse impact on the business operations of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits.
additionally, alternative retail channels, such as e-commerce retailers (including as a result of the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers), subscription services, discount and dollar stores, direct-to-consumer brands, drug stores and club stores, have become more prevalent. this trend away from traditional retail grocery, and towards such channels, is expected to continue in the future. if we are not successful in expanding sales in alternative retail channels, our business or financial results may be negatively impacted. in particular, substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. the expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits. in addition, these alternative retail channels may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. also, if these alternative retail channels, such as e-commerce retailers were to take significant share away from traditional retailers that could have a flow over effect on our business and our financial results could be negatively impacted.
our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.
we have a number of iconic brands with significant value. maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we, or any of our employees, have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, the products becoming unavailable to consumers, or the failure to meet the nutrition expectations of our products or particular ingredients in our products (whether or not valid), including whether certain of our products are perceived to contribute to obesity. in addition, due to our varied and geographically diverse consumer base, we must be responsive to local consumer needs, including with respect to when and how consumers consume food products and their desire for premium or value offerings, provide an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences. accordingly, we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences with respect to dietary trends or purchasing behaviors, invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image or achieve the desired efforts of our marketing efforts or use data-driven marketing and advertising to reach consumers at the right time with the right message. the growing use of social and digital media by consumers, kellogg and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. negative posts or comments about kellogg, our brands, our products or any of our employees on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands, reputation and brand loyalty, regardless of the information's accuracy. the harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. brand recognition and loyalty can also be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs and sponsorships, as well as our use of social media. if we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted.
tax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.
the company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where the company's subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions (including shifts in the geopolitical landscape), tax rates in the u.s. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change. the future effective tax rate could be effected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax asset and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which includes recently enacted u.s. tax reform and contemplated changes in other countries of long-standing tax principles if finalized and adopted could have a material impact on our income tax expense and deferred tax balances.
we are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the u.s. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. there can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
we also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. the enactment of or increases in tariffs, including value added tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in markets in which we are currently active, or may be active in the future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.
if our food products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability if consumers are injured as a result.
selling food products involves a number of legal and other risks, including product contamination, food borne illnesses, spoilage, product tampering, allergens, or other adulteration. we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded. we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. a widespread product recall or market withdrawal could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. we could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. a significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. moreover, even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is meritless, does not prevail or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our company and our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands.
we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients, or the food safety system generally. if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete, consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category. adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.
unanticipated business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale. we have a complex network of suppliers, owned manufacturing locations, contract manufacturer locations, warehousing and distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently. our ability to make, move and sell products globally is critical to our success. factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as product or raw material scarcity, weather (including any potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, fires or explosions, terrorism, political unrest, government shutdowns, tariffs and other trade restrictions, cybersecurity breaches, health pandemics, disruptions in logistics, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, supplier capacity constraints, or strikes, could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers', their suppliers or our contract manufacturers' operations. if we do not effectively prepare for and respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, technology, production or supply systems, we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers. if that occurs, we may lose our customers' confidence, and long-term consumer demand for our products could decline. in addition, insurance policies that may provide coverage with regard to such events may not cover any or all of the resulting financial losses. these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
evolving tax, environmental, food quality and safety or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, labeling, trade, food quality and safety and other regulations and laws could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition.
our activities or products, both in and outside of the united states, are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and government agencies, including the u.s. food and drug administration, u.s. federal trade commission, the u.s. departments of agriculture, commerce and labor, as well as similar and other authorities outside of the united states, international accords and treaties and others, including voluntary regulation by other bodies. legal and regulatory systems can change quickly, as demonstrated by the events of the brexit vote. in addition, legal and regulatory systems in emerging and developing markets may be less developed, and less certain. these laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic, regulatory or social events. in addition, the enforcement of remedies in certain foreign jurisdictions may be less certain, resulting in varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights.
the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of food products are subject to governmental regulation that impose additional regulatory requirements. those regulations control such matters as food quality and safety, ingredients, advertising, product or production requirements, labeling, sustainability of packaging (including plastics), import or export of our products or ingredients, relations with distributors and retailers, health and safety, the environment, and restrictions on the use of government programs, such as supplemental nutritional assistance program, to purchase certain of our products.
the marketing of food products has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. we are also regulated with respect to matters such as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, tax, anticorruption standards, advertising and claims, and environmental matters. the need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax, environmental, food quality and safety, labeling or other laws or regulations, or new, evolving or changed interpretations or enforcement of existing laws or regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. governmental and administrative bodies within the u.s. are considering a variety of trade and other regulatory reforms. changes in legal or regulatory requirements (such as new food safety requirements and revised nutrition facts labeling and serving size regulations), or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, termination of necessary licenses or permits, or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. even if regulatory review does not result in these types of determinations, it could potentially create negative publicity or perceptions which could harm our business or reputation. further, modifications to international trade policy, including the expected ratification of the united states-mexico-canada agreement, changes in the european union (such as brexit) or the imposition of increased or new tariffs, quotas or trade barriers on key commodities, could have a negative impact on us or the industries we serve, including as a result of related uncertainty, and could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
our operations face significant foreign currency exchange rate exposure and currency restrictions which could negatively impact our operating results.
we hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the u.s. dollar, including the euro, british pound, australian dollar, canadian dollar, mexican peso, brazilian real, nigerian naira, and russian ruble. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into u.s. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates and face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, the announcement and implementation of brexit has caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations. consequently, changes in the value of the u.s. dollar may unpredictably and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency.
potential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business.
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending our self in civil, criminal or regulatory actions (inclusive of class action lawsuits and foreign litigation), including under general, commercial, employment, environmental, data privacy or security, intellectual property, food quality and safety, anti-trust and trade, advertising and claims, and environmental laws and regulations, or in asserting our rights under various laws. for example, our marketing or claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs. in addition, we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements. the costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us, and new legal requirements, cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations.
our consolidated financial results and demand for our products are dependent on the successful development of new products and processes.
there are a number of trends in consumer preferences which may impact us and the industry as a whole. these include changing consumer dietary trends and the availability of substitute products.
our success is dependent on anticipating changes in consumer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes. trends within the food industry change often, and failure to identify and react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced loyalty, reduced demand and price reductions for our brands and products. we aim to introduce products or new or improved production processes on a timely basis in order to counteract obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. while we devote significant focus to the development of new products and to the research, development and technology process functions of our business, we may not be successful in developing new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. in addition, if sales generated by new products cause a decline in sales of the company's existing products, the company's financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets.
our postretirement benefit-related costs and funding requirements could increase as a result of volatility in the financial markets, changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions.
increases in the costs of postretirement medical and pension benefits may continue and negatively affect our business as a result of increased usage of medical benefits by retired employees and medical cost inflation, an increase in participants enrolled, the effect of potential declines in the stock and bond markets on the performance of our pension and post-retirement plan assets, potential reductions in the discount rate used to determine the present value of our benefit obligations, and changes to our investment strategy that may impact our expected return on pension and post-retirement plan assets assumptions. u.s. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. these valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. the company's accounting policy for defined benefit plans may subject earnings to volatility due to the recognition of actuarial gains and losses, particularly those due to the change in the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets and interest rates. in addition, funding requirements for our plans may become more significant. however, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension and post-retirement funding obligations.
we use available borrowings under the credit facilities and other available debt financing for cash to operate our business, which subjects us to market and counter-party risk, some of which is beyond our control.
in addition to cash we generate from our business, our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under our credit facilities and other available debt financing. if our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced, or if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason, we may not be able to fund daily operations, which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern. in addition, if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities, we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds, which could have similar adverse consequences.
from time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (ibors) and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an ibor. there is currently uncertainty whether certain ibors (such as libor) will continue to be available after 2021. if certain ibors cease to be available, we may need to amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders. as a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.
we utilize extended payment terms for customers and suppliers supplemented with third party financing programs to assist in effectively managing our core working capital. if the extension of payment terms are reversed or financial institutions terminate their participation, our ability to maintain current levels of core working capital could be adversely impacted.
our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. we utilize third-party financing programs to offset the negative impact of offering extended customer payment terms. in addition, in combination with extending supplier payment terms, structured payables programs are available to our suppliers which enable suppliers, at their sole discretion, to enter bilateral agreements to sell company payment obligations to designated third-party financial institutions.
changes in financial markets or interest rates could make these third party financing programs less attractive to the financial institutions purchasing trade accounts receivables and company payment obligations thereunder and these financial institutions may seek to terminate their participation. in the event of such termination or if our extended payment terms are reversed, our ability to effectively manage core working capital could be adversely impacted.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness.
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders' equity, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, or enter into off-balance sheet financing, which would increase our leverage risks. as of december 28, 2019, we had total debt of approximately $7.9 billion and total kellogg company equity of $2.7 billion.
•   impairing the ability to access global capital markets to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward or if a rating organization announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade;
•   a downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly our short-term credit rating, would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue, increase our commercial paper borrowing costs, or both;
•   restricting our flexibility in responding to changing market conditions or making us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions or our business;
•   requiring a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available to us for other purposes such as expansion through acquisitions, paying dividends, repurchasing shares, marketing and other spending and expansion of our product offerings; and
•   causing us to be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.
our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness or incur new indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions, the availability of, and interest rates on, short-term financing, and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.
our performance is affected by general economic, political and social conditions and taxation policies.
customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by recession, financial and credit market disruptions, or other economic downturns in the united states or other nations. our results in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by changes in general economic, political and social conditions in the united states and other countries, including the interest rate environment in which we conduct business, the financial markets through which we access capital and currency, trade policy, political and social unrest and terrorist acts in the united states or other countries in which we carry on business. the economic, political and social conditions resulting from brexit, among other events, may adversely impact our overall performance.
current economic conditions globally may delay or reduce purchases by our customers and consumers. this could result in reductions in sales of our products, reduced acceptance of innovations, and increased price competition. deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower collections on accounts receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. financial institutions may be negatively impacted by economic conditions and may consolidate or cease to do business which could result in a tightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and increased volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. there could be a number of effects from a financial institution credit crisis on our business, which could include impaired credit availability and financial stability of our customers, including our suppliers, co-manufacturers and distributors. a disruption in financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management. any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we may not be able to attract, develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.
we depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. in addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to identify, recruit, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, recruit, train, develop and retain other talented personnel. any such loss, failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results. in addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. additionally, changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees.
an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth.
the carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. the carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, trade names, and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date. goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment. if carrying value exceeds current fair value, the intangible is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a charge to earnings. factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) higher commodity prices; (iii) lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition; and (iv) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events. should the value of one or more of the acquired intangibles become impaired, our consolidated earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected.
as of december 28, 2019, the carrying value of intangible assets totaled approximately $8.4 billion, of which $5.8 billion was goodwill and $2.6 billion represented trademarks, tradenames, and other acquired intangibles compared to total assets of $17.5 billion and total kellogg company equity of $2.7 billion.
competition against private label brands could negatively impact our business.
in nearly all of our product categories, we compete against branded products as well as private label products. our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors' products or if consumers perceive this type of change. if consumers prefer private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices, then we could lose category share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings, which could have a material effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.
we may not achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives.
our success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. we have invested a significant amount in capital expenditures to improve our operational facilities. ongoing operational issues are likely to occur when carrying out major production, procurement, or logistical changes and these, as well as any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position and on the consolidated results of our operations and profitability.
technology failures, cyber attacks, privacy breaches or data breaches could disrupt our operations, reputation and negatively impact our business.
we increasingly rely on information technology systems and third party service providers, including through the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. for example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs. information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations. furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between, and storage of personal data of, our personnel, customers, consumers and suppliers depends on information technology. our information technology systems, and the systems of the parties we communicate and collaborate with, may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our or their control, including, but not limited to, network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, cyberattacks by common hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations or social-activist (hacktivist) organizations, geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic events.
moreover, our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be subjected to computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other malicious codes, social engineering attacks, unauthorized access attempts, password theft, physical breaches, employee or inside error, malfeasance and cyber- or phishing-attacks. cyber threats are constantly evolving, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, and this increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. these events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage. furthermore, if a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm. to date, we have not experienced a material breach of cyber security. while we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions, such as the maintenance of an information security program that includes updating our technology and security policies, insurance, employee training, and monitoring and routinely testing our information technology systems to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems.
the company offers promotions, rebates, customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information, and it or its vendors could experience cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer, customer, employee or company information. the company must also successfully integrate the technology systems of acquired companies into the company's existing and future technology systems. in addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. there is significant uncertainty with respect to compliance with such privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the european union general data protection regulation (gdpr) and the california consumer privacy act of 2018 (ccpa), which went into effect on january 1, 2020 (each of which imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored), because they are continuously evolving and developing and may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. additionally, our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws, including the gdpr and ccpa, may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time.
if the company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology, including such cyber-attack, privacy breaches, data breaches, issues with or errors in system maintenance or security, migration of applications to the cloud, power outages, hardware or software failures, denial of service, telecommunication or other incident involving one of the company's vendors, that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business, financial, personal or stakeholder information, the company may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm and may be exposed to legal liability and government investigations, which may adversely affect the company's results of operations and/or financial condition. the misuse, leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws, the company may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. the company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems. in addition, if the company's suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in the company's supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect the company's business operations. we have also outsourced several information technology support services and administrative functions to third-party service providers, including cloud-based service providers, and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. if these service providers do not perform effectively due to breach or system failure, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits and our business may be disrupted.
our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.
we consider our intellectual property rights, particularly and most notably our trademarks, but also including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, our technology, or any other form of intellectual property, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.
we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology, brands or products or operations. in addition, if, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, such finding could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products. any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products.
we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally.
we are a global company and generated 42% and 40% of our net sales for 2019 and 2018, respectively outside the united states. we manufacture our products in 21 countries and have operations in more than 180 countries, so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations. those risks include:
•   compliance with u.s. laws affecting operations outside of the united states, such as ofac trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations,
•   compliance with anti-corruption laws, including u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and u.k. bribery act (ukba),
•   compliance with antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws, and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple regimes,
•   changes in tax laws, interpretation of tax laws and tax audit outcomes,
•   fluctuations or devaluations in currency values, especially in emerging markets,
•   changes in capital controls, including currency exchange controls, government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or repatriate cash from outside the united states,
•   changes in local regulations and laws, the lack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries in which we operate and the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in such jurisdictions, and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources,
•   laws relating to information security, privacy (including the gdpr), cashless payments, and consumer protection,
•   uncertainty relating to the future trading relationship between the united kingdom and european union as a result of brexit and its impact on the local and international markets, the flow of goods and materials across borders, and political environments,
•   increased sovereign risk, such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit worthiness of local governments,
•   greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles,
•   loss of ability to manage our operations in certain markets which could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses,
•   design and implementation of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base,
•   imposition of more or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, price controls, and similar restrictions in the countries in which we or our suppliers or manufacturers operate or regulations, taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales, and
•   changes in trade policies and trade relations.
in addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest and government shutdowns, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation and other economic or political or social uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand. the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending, and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability. continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us. all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
there may be uncertainty as a result of key global events during 2020. for example, the continuing uncertainty related to the future trading relationship between the united kingdom and the european union arising from the brexit referendum and international trade disputes, as well as ongoing terrorist activity, may adversely impact global stock markets (including the new york stock exchange on which our common shares are traded) and general global economic conditions. all of these factors are outside of our control, but may nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets.
the results of the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.
following the result of a referendum in 2016, the united kingdom left the european union on january 31, 2020, commonly referred to as brexit.  pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the united kingdom and european union, the united kingdom will be subject to a transition period until december 31, 2020 (the "transition period"), during which time european union rules will continue to apply.  negotiations between the united kingdom and the european union are expected to continue in relation to the customs and trading relationship between the united kingdom and the european union following the expiration of the transition period.
the uncertainty concerning the united kingdom's legal, political and economic relationship with the european union after the transition period may be a source of instability in the international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, and/or otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar cross-border co-operation arrangements (whether economic, tax, fiscal, legal, regulatory or otherwise).  we may also face new regulatory costs and challenges as a result of brexit (including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the united kingdom and european union) that could have an adverse effect on our operations. for example, the united kingdom could lose the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the european union on behalf of its members, which may result in increased trade barriers that could make our doing business in the european union and the european economic area more difficult. any of these developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.
potential impacts to our business include: (i) reduced efficiency in processing of product shipments between the united kingdom and other countries that could impact our ability to have sufficient products in the appropriate market for sale to customers, (ii) requirement to increase inventory levels maintained in both the united kingdom and other countries to ensure adequate supply of product to support both base and promotional activities normally executed with our customers, (iii) increased costs related to incremental warehousing and logistics services required to adequately service our customers, (iv) significant financial impact resulting from tariffs that are implemented between the united kingdom and other countries as the location of our european production facilities and the markets we sell in regularly require significant import and export shipments involving the united kingdom, (v) our ability to realize future benefit from other assets on our balance sheet, such as deferred tax assets, may be impacted which could result in additional valuation allowances or reserves being established.
our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks.
our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets. however, some emerging markets have greater political, economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets. in many countries outside of the united states, particularly those with emerging economies, it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach, such as the fcpa and the ukba, or local anti-bribery laws. these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials, including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business. failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities. our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy. if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political, economic and regulatory risks, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations.
climate change is a core business issue for kellogg to ensure the long-term health and viability of the ingredients we use in our products. as set forth in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report, there is continuing scientific evidence, as well as concern from members of the general public, that emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing human activities have caused and will continue to cause significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of weather events, wildfires and flooding. as the pressures from climate change and global population growth lead to increased demand, the food system and global supply chain is becoming increasingly vulnerable to acute shocks, leading to increased prices and volatility, especially in the energy and commodity markets. adverse changes such as these could:
•   unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water;
•   disrupt production schedules and our ability, or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute our products;
•   disrupt the retail operations of our customers; or
•   unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, our products.
there is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single use plastics. this new or increased focus may result in new or increased laws and regulations that could cause significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. in particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. lastly, consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made, requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. as a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations kellogg company and subsidiaries results of operations business overview the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to help the reader understand kellogg company, our operations and our present business environment. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item 8 of this report, as well as part ii, 'item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for the year ended december 29, 2018, which provides additional information on comparisons of years 2018 and 2017.
for more than 110 years, consumers have counted on kellogg for great-tasting, high-quality and nutritious foods. these foods include snacks, such as crackers, savory snacks, toaster pastries, cereal bars and bites; and convenience foods, such as, ready-to-eat cereals, frozen waffles, veggie foods and noodles. kellogg products are manufactured and marketed globally. consumption and share data noted within is based on nielsen x-aoc or other comparable source, for the applicable period. unless otherwise noted, consumption and shipment trends are materially consistent.
segments on december 30, 2018 we reorganized our north american business. the reorganization eliminated the legacy business unit structure and internal reporting. in addition, we changed the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker (codm) and segment manager. as a result, we reevaluated our operating segments. in conjunction with the reorganization, certain global research and development resources and related activities were transferred from the north america business to corporate. prior period segment results were not restated for the transfer as the impacts were not considered material.
in addition, we transferred our middle east, north africa, and turkey businesses (menat) from kellogg europe to kellogg amea, effective december 30, 2018. this consolidated all of the company's africa business under a single regional management team. all comparable prior periods have been restated to reflect the change. for the years ended december 29, 2018 and december 30, 2017, the change resulted in $273 million and $241 million, respectively, of reported net sales and $46 million and $56 million, respectively, of reported operating profit transferring from europe to amea.
on july 28, 2019, we completed the sale of selected cookies, fruit and fruit-flavored snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cones businesses to ferrero international s.a. ("ferrero") for $1.3 billion in cash, on a cash-free, debt-free basis and subject to a working capital adjustment mechanism. the operating results for these businesses were included primarily in our north america reporting segment prior to the sale.
we manage our operations through four operating segments that are based primarily on geographic location - north america which includes the u.s. businesses and canada; europe which consists principally of european countries; latin america which consists of central and south america and includes mexico; and amea (asia middle east africa) which consists of africa, middle east, australia and other asian and pacific markets. these operating segments also represent our reportable segments.
non-gaap financial measures this filing includes non-gaap financial measures that we provide to management and investors that exclude certain items that we do not consider part of on-going operations. items excluded from our non-gaap financial measures are discussed in the "significant items impacting comparability" section of this filing. our management team consistently utilizes a combination of gaap and non-gaap financial measures to evaluate business results, to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions, including incentive compensation. as a result, we believe the presentation of both gaap and non-gaap financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors' understanding of our underlying operating performance and in their analysis of ongoing operating trends. all historic non-gaap financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
non-gaap financial measures non-gaap financial measures used for evaluation of performance include currency-neutral and organic net sales, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted operating profit, adjusted and currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share (eps), currency-neutral adjusted gross profit, currency neutral adjusted gross margin, adjusted other income (expense), and cash flow. we determine currency-neutral results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current period u.s. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. these non-gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.
•   currency-neutral net sales and organic net sales: we adjust the gaap financial measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral net sales. in addition, we exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency, and differences in shipping days resulting in organic net sales. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying net sales performance. by providing these non-gaap net sales measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of net sales performance for the company and each of our reportable segments for the periods presented. management uses these non-gaap measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives behind net sales growth, pricing realization, and the impact of mix on our business results. these non-gaap measures are also used to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions.
•   adjusted operating profit and diluted eps: we adjust the gaap financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan exit liabilities, the gain on divestiture of our cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses, and other costs impacting comparability. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. by providing these non-gaap profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's profitability measures for the periods presented. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments.
•   currency-neutral adjusted gross profit, gross margin, operating profit, and diluted eps: we adjust the gaap financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan exit liabilities, the gain on divestiture of our cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses, and other costs impacting comparability, and foreign currency, resulting in currency-neutral adjusted. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. by providing these non-gaap profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's profitability measures for the periods presented. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives within each of our segments.
•   adjusted other income (expense), net: we adjust the gaap financial measure to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets,and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), the gain on the divestiture of our selected cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses, and other costs impacting comparability. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our underlying profitability. by providing this non-gaap measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's other income (expense), net, excluding the impact of the items noted above, for the periods presented. management uses these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability.
•   adjusted effective income tax rate: we adjust the gaap financial measures to exclude the effect of restructuring programs, mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodities and certain foreign currency contracts, multi-employer pension plan exit liabilities, the gain on divestiture of our selected cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cone businesses, and other costs impacting comparability. we excluded the items which we believe may obscure trends in our pre-tax income, the related tax effect of those items, and other impacts to tax expense, including u.s tax reform and certain out-of-period adjustments, on our adjusted effective income tax rate. by providing this non-gaap measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the company's effective tax rate, excluding the impact of items noted above, for the periods presented. management uses this non-gaap measure to monitor the effectiveness of initiatives in place to optimize our global tax rate.
•   cash flow: defined as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. we use this non-gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases once all of the company's business needs and obligations are met. additionally, certain performance-based compensation includes a component of this non-gaap measure.
these measures have not been calculated in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for gaap reporting measures.
significant items impacting comparability mark-to-market accounting for pension plans, commodities and certain foreign currency contracts we recognize mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans, commodity contracts, and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. actuarial gains/losses for pension plans were recognized in the year they occur. changes between contract and market prices for commodities contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that were recognized in the quarter they occur. we recorded a total pre-tax mark-to-market charge of $104 million for 2019, a total pre-tax mark-to-market charge of $343 million for 2018 and a total pre-tax mark-to-market benefit of $45 million in 2017. included within the aforementioned totals was a pre-tax mark-to-market charge for pension plans of $98 million for 2019, a pre-tax mark-to-market charge for pension plans of $335 million for 2018 and a pre-tax mark-to-market benefit for pension plans of $86 million for 2017.
project k project k continued generating savings used to invest in key strategic areas of focus for the business. we recorded pre-tax charges related to this program of $54 million in 2019, $143 million in 2018 and $263 million in 2017.
see the restructuring and cost reduction activities section for more information.
brexit impacts with the uncertainty associated with the united kingdom's (u.k.) exit from the european union (eu), commonly referred to as brexit, we have begun preparations to proactively prepare for the potential adverse impacts of brexit, such as delays at ports of entry and departure. as a result, we incurred pre-tax charges of $9 million in 2019 and a pre-tax charge of $3 million in 2018.
business and portfolio realignment one-time costs related to divestitures and acquisitions, including the divestiture of our cookies, fruit snacks, pie crusts, and ice-cream cone businesses; reorganizations in support of our deploy for growth priorities and a reshaped portfolio; and investments in enhancing capabilities prioritized by our deploy for growth strategy. as a result, we incurred pre-tax charges, primarily related to reorganizations of $156 million in 2019 and $5 million in 2018.
multi-employer pension plan exit liability during the third quarter of 2019, the company incurred a pre-tax charge of $132 million due to withdrawing from two multi-employer pension plans.
divestitures on july 28, 2019, the company completed its sale of selected cookies, fruit and fruit flavored snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cones businesses to ferrero for approximately $1.3 billion in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment mechanism. both the total assets and net assets of the businesses were approximately $1.3 billion, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $38 million during the third quarter, recorded in other income and (expense). additionally, the company recognized curtailment gains related to the divestiture totaling $17 million in our u.s. pension and nonpension postretirement plans.
the operating results for the divested businesses were primarily included in the north america reporting segment prior to the sale. reported net sales for the divested businesses totaled $308 million for the last five months of the year ended december 29, 2018.
acquisitions in october of 2017, the company acquired chicago bar company llc manufacturer of rxbar, a high protein snack bar made of simple ingredients. in our north america reported segments for the year ended december 29, 2018, the acquisition added $186 million in net sales that impacted the comparability of 2017 reported results.
in may of 2018, the company acquired an incremental 1% ownership interest in multipro, which along with concurrent changes to the shareholders' agreement, resulted in the company now having a 51% controlling interest in and began consolidating multipro, a leading distributor of a variety of food products in nigeria and ghana. in our amea reportable segment, year ended december 28, 2019, the acquisition added $271 million in net sales that impacted the comparability of 2018 reported results. additionally, for the year ended december 29, 2018, the acquisition added $536 million in net sales that impacted the comparability of 2017 reported results.
shipping day differences in december 2017, we eliminated a one-month timing difference in reporting of the financial results for the parati group. this update resulted in an additional month of financial results being reported in the year ended december 30, 2017, which included $14 million of net sales that impacted the comparability of 2018 versus 2017.
out-of-period adjustment during the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct an error related to a prior year which increased income tax expense by $39 million.  see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
u.s. tax reform the adoption of u.s. tax reform impacted income tax expense in 2018 resulting in a net $11 million reduction of income tax expense for the year ended december 29, 2018, primarily related to the transition tax and assertion on foreign earnings.
gain on unconsolidated entities, net in connection with the multipro business combination, the company recognized a one-time, non-cash gain on the disposition of our previously held equity interest in multipro of $245 million. additionally, the company exercised its call option to acquire a 50% interest in tolaram africa foods, pte ltd, a holding company with a 49% equity interest in an affiliated food manufacturer, resulting in the company having a 24.5% interest in the affiliated food manufacturer. in conjunction with the exercise, the company recognized a one-time, non-cash loss of $45 million, which represents an other than temporary excess of cost over fair value of the investment. these amounts were recorded within earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities during the second quarter of 2018.
foreign currency translation we evaluate the operating results of our business on a currency-neutral basis. we determine currency-neutral operating results by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate our financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period u.s. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. organic net sales exclude the impact of acquisitions, including the foreign currency impact calculated by applying the prior year foreign currency rates to current period results.
financial results for the full year 2019, our reported net sales increased by 0.2% as a full year of multipro results and organic net sales growth were largely offset by unfavorable foreign currency and the absence of results from the businesses divested in july. organic net sales increased 1.9% after excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency, with growth in all four regions.
reported operating profit decreased 18% due primarily to higher business and portfolio realignment charges, the multi-employer pension plan exit liability and the absence of results from the businesses divested in july partially offset by lower project k costs. currency-neutral adjusted operating profit decreased 4.9% after excluding the impact of business and portfolio realignment, multi-employer pension plan exit liability, project k and foreign currency.
reported diluted eps of $2.80 was down 27% compared to the prior year of $3.83 due to a one-time non-cash gain related to our transaction in west africa in the prior year, higher business and portfolio realignment charges, the multi-employer pension plan exit liability and the absence of results from the businesses divested in july partially offset by lower project k costs and favorable mark-to-market impacts. currency-neutral adjusted diluted eps of $4.00 decreased 7.6% compared to $4.33 in the prior year, after excluding business and portfolio realignment, multi-employer pension plan exit liability, gain from unconsolidated entities, project k, mark-to-market, and foreign currency.

restructuring programs we view our restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of our operating principles to provide greater visibility in achieving our long-term profit growth targets. initiatives undertaken are currently expected to recover cash implementation costs within a three to five-year period of completion. upon completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation.
project k as of the end of 2019, the company has completed implementation of all project k initiatives. total project charges, after-tax cash costs and annual savings delivered by project k were in line with expectations.
since inception, project k has reduced the company's cost structure, and provided enduring benefits, including an optimized supply chain infrastructure, an efficient global business services model, a global focus on categories, increased agility from a more efficient organization design, and improved effectiveness in go-to-market models. these benefits have strengthened existing businesses in core markets, increased growth in developing and emerging markets, and driven an increased level of value-added innovation.
cumulatively, project k resulted in total pre-tax charges of approximately $1.6 billion, with after-tax cash costs, including incremental capital investments of approximately $1.2 billion.
annual cost savings generated from project k are approximately $700 million. these savings were realized primarily in selling, general and administrative expense with additional benefit realized in gross profit as cost of goods sold savings are partially offset by negative volume and price impacts resulting from go-to-market business model changes. the overall savings profile of the project reflects our go-to-market initiatives that will impact both selling, general and administrative expense and gross profit. cost savings have been utilized to offset inflation and fund investments in areas such as in-store execution, sales capabilities, including adding sales representatives, and in the design and quality of our products. we have also invested in production capacity in developing and emerging markets, and in global category teams.
refer to note 5 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to project k and other restructuring activities.
other programs during 2019, the company announced a reorganization plan for the european reportable segment designed to simplify the organization, increase organizational efficiency, and enhance key processes. the overall project is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2020.
the project is expected to result in cumulative pretax net charges of approximately $40 million, including certain non-cash credits. cash costs are expected to be approximately $50 million. the total expected charges will include severance and other termination benefits and charges related to relocation, third party legal and consulting fees, and contract termination costs.
the company recorded total net charges of $38 million related to this initiative during 2019, with $43 million recorded in sg&a expense and $(5) million recorded in oie.
also during 2019, the company announced a reorganization plan which primarily impacts the north america reportable segment. the reorganization plan is designed to simplify the organization that supports the remaining north america reportable segment after the divestiture and related transition. the overall project is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2020.
the overall project is expected to result in cumulative pretax charges of approximately $30 million. cash costs are expected to approximate the pretax charges. total expected charges will include severance and other termination benefits and charges related to third party consulting fees.
the company recorded total charges of $21 million related to this initiative during 2019. these charges were recorded in sg&a expense.
foreign currency translation the reporting currency for our financial statements is the u.s. dollar. certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, primarily in the euro, british pound, mexican peso, australian dollar, canadian dollar, brazilian real, nigerian naira, and russian ruble. to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues into u.s. dollars at the applicable exchange rates. as a result, increases and decreases in the value of the u.s. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. this could have significant impact on our results if such increase or decrease in the value of the u.s. dollar is substantial.
interest expense interest expense was $284 million and $287 million for the years ended december 28, 2019 and december 29, 2018, respectively. interest expense capitalized as part of the construction cost of fixed assets was immaterial for both periods. the slight decrease from the prior year is due primarily to interest savings related to the debt redemption and the impact of a favorable settlement of tax-related interest partially offset by debt redemption costs.
the 2019 effective income tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a permanent basis difference in the assets sold to ferrero as well as an out-of-period correction. during the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an out-of-period adjustment to correct an error in the tax rate applied to a deferred tax asset arising from an intellectual property transfer in a prior year. the adjustment increased income tax expense and decreased deferred tax assets by $39 million, respectively. we determined the adjustment to be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 28, 2019 and related prior annual and quarterly periods.
the 2018 effective tax rate benefited from an $11 million net reduction of income tax expense related to our adoption of u.s. tax reform, the favorable impact of discretionary pension contributions totaling $250 million, which were designated as 2017 tax year contributions, and a $44 million discrete tax benefit as a result of the remeasurement of deferred taxes following a legal entity restructuring.
the following table provides a reconciliation of reported to adjusted income taxes and effective income tax rate for 2019 and 2018.

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the expected effective income tax rate as it is dependent upon u.s. dollar earnings of foreign subsidiaries doing business in various countries with differing statutory rates. additionally, the rate could be impacted by tax legislation and if pending uncertain tax matters, including tax positions that could be affected by planning initiatives, are resolved more or less favorably than we currently expect.
brexit the united kingdom left the european union on january 31, 2020, and moved into the 11 month transition period in which the country will remain subject to the european union's custom union and single market rules while negotiating a future trade deal. the transition may be extended, if no trade deal or extension is reached by december 31, 2020, the united kingdom will move to world trade organization trade terms with the european union.
the impact to the financial trends of our european and consolidated businesses resulting from the future trading relationship between the united kingdom and the european union will continue to be monitored and evaluated over the course of 2020. during 2019, we generated approximately 5% of our net sales and hold approximately 3% of consolidated assets in the united kingdom as of december 28, 2019. as details of the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union are finalized, we will continue to evaluate the impacts to our business. brexit may impact our future financial trends in areas such as:
•   net sales could be negatively impacted by reduced efficiency in processing of product shipments between the united kingdom and other countries resulting in insufficient products in the appropriate market for sale to customers,
•   cost of goods sold could increase due to increased costs related to incremental warehousing and logistics services required to adequately service our customers,
•   cost of goods sold could increase significantly due to tariffs that are implemented between the united kingdom and other countries as the location of our european production facilities and the markets we sell in regularly require significant import and export shipments involving the united kingdom,
•   profitability may be impacted as we update our conclusions on our ability to realize future benefit from other assets, such as deferred tax assets, or as we evaluate the effectiveness of existing or future derivative contracts. this may result in additional valuation allowances or reserves being established, or require changes in the notional value of derivative contracts,
•   cash flow could decrease as a result of the requirement to increase inventory levels maintained in both the united kingdom and other countries to ensure adequate supply of product to support both base and promotional activities normally executed with our customers.
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows supplemented by borrowings for major acquisitions and other significant transactions. our cash-generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating and investing needs.
we have historically reported negative working capital primarily as the result of our focus to improve core working capital by reducing our levels of trade receivables and inventory while extending the timing of payment of our trade payables.  the impacts of the extended customer terms programs and of the monetization programs are included in our calculation of core working capital and are largely offsetting. core working capital was improved by the extension of supplier payment terms. these programs are all part of our ongoing working capital management.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which results in current maturities of long-term debt and notes payable which can have a significant impact on working capital as a result of the timing of these required payments. these factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, fund acquisition opportunities, and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts.
we had negative working capital of $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion as of december 28, 2019 and december 29, 2018, respectively.
in conjunction with the july 28, 2019 closing of the sale of selected cookies, fruit and fruit-flavored snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cones businesses to ferrero for approximately $1.3 billion in cash, after-tax proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion were used to redeem outstanding debt, which reduced our leverage and provides additional financial flexibility for future operating and investing needs.
we believe that our operating cash flows, together with our credit facilities and other available debt financing, including commercial paper, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. however, there can be no assurance that volatility and/or disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows:
operating activities                                                      $1,176                   $1,536
effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents                         31                       18
operating activities the principal source of our operating cash flows is net earnings, primarily cash receipts from the sale of our products, net of costs to manufacture and market our products.
our net cash provided by operating activities for 2019 totaled $1,176 million, a decrease of $360 million as compared to 2018. the decrease was due primarily to the current year impact of the divestiture, including related taxes paid and restructuring costs, and the year-over-year impact of accounts receivable partially offset by lower pension contributions.
our cash conversion cycle (defined as days of inventory and trade receivables outstanding less days of trade payables outstanding, based on a trailing 12 month average), is approximately negative 5 and negative 6 days for 2019 and 2018, respectively. core working capital in 2019 averaged 1.7% of net sales compared to 2.4% in 2018.
our total pension and postretirement benefit plan funding amounted to $28 million and $287 million for the years ended december 28, 2019 and december 29, 2018, respectively. the 2018 contributions included $250 million of pre-tax discretionary contributions to u.s. plans designated for the 2017 tax year.
the pension protection act (ppa), and subsequent regulations, determines defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements in the united states. we believe that we will not be required to make any contributions under ppa requirements until 2022 or beyond. our projections concerning timing of ppa funding requirements are subject to change primarily based on general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, future discount rates based on average yields of high quality corporate bonds and our decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa.
we currently project that we will make total u.s. and foreign benefit plan contributions in 2020 of approximately $26 million. actual 2020 contributions could be different from our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities, future changes in government requirements, trust asset performance, renewals of union contracts, or higher-than-expected health care claims cost experience.
we measure cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. we use this non-gaap financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available over time for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases. our cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable gaap measure, as follows:
net cash provided by operating activities          $1,176              $1,536
additions to properties                              (586   )            (578   )
investing activities our net cash provided by investing activities for 2019 totaled $774 million compared to cash used of $948 million in 2018. the change was due primarily to the divestiture of selected cookies, fruit and fruit-flavored snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cones businesses to ferrero for approximately $1.3 billion of cash as well as our acquisition of an ownership interest in tolaram africa foods, pte ltd (taf) for $381 million during 2018.
capital spending in 2019 included investments in our supply chain infrastructure, including new plants in emerging markets, network optimization, and packaging flexibility in global manufacturing and distribution.
cash paid for additions to properties as a percentage of net sales was 4.3% in both 2019 and 2018.
in august 2019, the company redeemed $191 million of its 4.15% u.s. dollar notes due november 2019, $248 million of its 4.00% u.s. dollar notes due 2020, $202 million of its 3.25% u.s. dollar notes due 2021, and $50 million of its 2.65% u.s. dollar notes due 2023. in september 2019, the company redeemed $309 million of its 4.15% u.s. dollar notes due november 2019, the remaining principal balance subsequent to the august redemption.
in may 2018, we issued $600 million of ten-year 4.30% senior notes due 2028 and $400 million of three-year 3.25% senior notes due 2021, resulting in aggregate net proceeds after debt discount of $994 million. the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of our $400 million, seven-year 3.25% u.s. dollar notes due 2018 at maturity, and the repayment of a portion of our commercial paper borrowings used to finance our acquisition of ownership interests in taf and multipro.
we paid quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling $2.26 per share in 2019. total cash paid for dividends increased by 2.7% in 2019. on february 21, 2020, the board of directors declared a dividend of $.57 per common share, payable on march 16, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on march 3, 2020.
the five-year and 364 day credit agreements which had no outstanding borrowings as december 28, 2019, contain customary covenants and warranties, including specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens and a specified interest expense coverage ratio.  if an event of default occurs, then, to the extent permitted, the administrative agents may terminate the commitments under the credit facilities, accelerate any outstanding loans under the agreements, and demand the deposit of cash collateral equal to the lender's letter of credit exposure plus interest.
during the third quarter of 2019, in connection with the divestiture of selected cookies, fruit and fruit-flavored snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cones businesses, the company withdrew from two multi-employer pension plans and recorded withdrawal liabilities of $132 million.  while this represents our best estimate of the cost of withdrawing from the plans at this time, we have not yet reached agreement on the ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability. subsequent to the end of the year, the company and the lenders under the five-year and 364-day credit agreements entered into a waiver agreement addressing any matters that arose or may arise from these liabilities under the agreements, as long as the aggregate amount of such liabilities does not exceed $250 million.  the company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in these agreements at december 28, 2019.
our notes contain customary covenants that limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined) to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and also contain a change of control provision. there are no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends. we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 28, 2019.
the notes do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings. a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the u.s. short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future. however, even under these circumstances, we would continue to have access to our 364-day credit facility, which expires in january 2021, as well as our five-year credit agreement, which expires in january 2023. this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis, although we do not currently plan to use it.
we monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions, including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities, our derivative financial instruments, and other arrangements.
we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future, while still meeting our operational needs, including the pursuit of select acquisitions. this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow, our short-term borrowings, and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis.
monetization and accounts payable programs we have a program in which customers could extend their payment terms in exchange for the elimination of early payment discounts (extended terms program). in order to mitigate the net working capital impact of the extended terms program for discrete customers, we entered into agreements to sell, on a revolving basis, certain trade accounts receivable balances to third party financial institutions (monetization programs). transfers under the monetization programs are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized from our consolidated balance sheet. the monetization programs provide for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until terminated by either party; however the maximum funding from receivables that may be sold at any time is currently $1,033 million, but may be increased or decreased as customers move in or out of the extended terms program and as additional financial institutions move in or out of the monetization programs. accounts receivable sold of $774 million and $900 million remained outstanding under this arrangement as of december 28, 2019 and december 29, 2018, respectively.
the monetization programs are designed to directly offset the impact the extended terms program would have on the days-sales-outstanding (dso) metric that is critical to the effective management of the company's accounts receivable balance and overall working capital. current dso levels within north america are consistent with dso levels prior to the execution of the extended term program and monetization programs.
refer to note 2 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the sale of accounts receivable.
additionally we have agreements with third parties (accounts payable program) to provide accounts payable tracking systems which facilitate participating suppliers' ability to monitor and, if elected, sell our payment obligations to designated third-party financial institutions. participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to sell one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions. our goal is to capture overall supplier savings, in the form of payment terms or vendor funding, and the agreements facilitate the suppliers' ability to sell payment obligations, while providing them with greater working capital flexibility. we have no economic interest in the sale of these suppliers' receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services. our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers' decisions to sell amounts under the arrangements. however, our right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by the agreements for those payment obligations that have been sold by suppliers.
refer to note 1 within notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to accounts payable.
if financial institutions were to terminate their participation in the monetization or accounts payable programs, working capital could be negatively impacted.  in addition, a downgrade in our credit rating could result in higher costs to participating accounts payable programs suppliers or our extended payment terms being reversed, the latter of which could negatively impact working capital.  if working capital is negatively impacted as a result of these events and we were unable to secure alternative programs, we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements for short-term liquidity or increase our long-term borrowings.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off-balance sheet arrangements at december 28, 2019, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.
operating leases (c)                        610                 129                  98                  80                  67                  55                   181
(a)   includes interest payments on our long-term debt and payments on our interest rate swaps. interest calculated on our variable rate debt was forecasted using the libor forward rate curve as of december 28, 2019.
(c)   operating leases represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(d)   purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business and for marketing, advertising and other services. the amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or other current liabilities at year-end 2019, nor does the table reflect cash flows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. therefore, it should be noted that the exclusion of these items from the table could be a limitation in assessing our total future cash flows under contracts.
(e)   as of december 28, 2019, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $90 million, of which $19 million scheduled to be paid in the next twelve months. we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $71 million.
(f)   other long-term obligations are those associated with noncurrent liabilities recorded within the consolidated balance sheet at year-end 2019 and consist principally of projected commitments under deferred compensation arrangements, multiemployer plans, and supplemental employee retirement benefits. the table also includes our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans through 2024 as follows: 2020-$46; 2021-$39; 2022-$40; 2023-$39; 2024-$48; 2025-$68.
in addition, $80 million of insurance loss reserves and $26 million of tax repatriation payable are expected to be paid over the next four and seven years, respectively, are included in the total above.
critical accounting estimates promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted either through the retail trade or directly with consumers and include activities such as in-store displays and events, feature price discounts, consumer coupons, contests and loyalty programs. the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded, which normally precedes the actual cash expenditure. the recognition of these costs therefore requires management judgment regarding the volume of promotional offers that will be redeemed by either the retail trade or consumer. these estimates are made using various techniques including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs. differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are normally immaterial and recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. on a full-year basis, these subsequent period adjustments represent approximately 0.3% of our company's net sales. however, our company's total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a revenue reduction) are significant, so it is likely our results would be materially different if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail.
property long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. management evaluates several conditions, including, but not limited to, the following: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or an asset group; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used, including an extended period of idleness; and a current expectation that, more likely than not, a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. for assets to be held and used, we project the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by the long-lived asset or asset group over the remaining useful life of the primary asset. if the cash flow analysis yields an amount less than the carrying amount we determine the fair value of the asset or asset group by using comparable market data. there are inherent uncertainties associated with the judgments and estimates we use in these analyses.
at december 28, 2019, we have property, plant and equipment of $3.6 billion, net of accumulated depreciation, on our balance sheet.
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual budgeting process.
goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of a reporting unit with associated goodwill. carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. for the 2019 goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting units was estimated based on market multiples of sales, if applicable, and/or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) and earnings for companies comparable to our reporting units. in the event the fair value determined using the market multiples approach is close to the carrying value, we may also supplement our fair value determination using discounted cash flows. management believes the assumptions used for the impairment test are consistent with those utilized by a market participant performing similar valuations for our reporting units.
similarly, impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets requires a comparison of carrying value to fair value of that particular asset. fair values of non-goodwill intangible assets are based primarily on projections of future cash flows to be generated from that asset. for instance, cash flows related to a particular trademark would be based on a projected royalty stream attributable to branded product sales discounted at rates consistent with rates used by market participants. these estimates are made using various inputs including historical data, current and anticipated market conditions, management plans, and market comparables.
we also evaluate the useful life over which a non-goodwill intangible asset with a finite life is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flows. reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.
on december 30, 2018 the company reorganized our north american business. the reorganization eliminated the legacy business unit structure and internal reporting. in addition, the company changed the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker (codm) and segment manager. as a result, the company reevaluated its operating segments and reporting units.
in addition, we transferred the management of our middle east, north africa, and turkey businesses from kellogg europe to kellogg amea, effective december 30, 2018.
refer to note 4, goodwill and other intangibles, and note 17, reportable segments for further details on these changes.
as a result of these changes in operating segments and related reporting units, the company re-allocated goodwill between reporting units where necessary and compared the carrying value to the fair value of each impacted reporting unit on a before and after basis. this evaluation was only required to be performed on reporting units impacted by the changes noted above.
effective december 30, 2018 in north america, the previous u.s. snacks, u.s. morning foods, u.s. specialty channels, u.s. frozen foods, kashi, canada and rx operating segments are now a single operating segment (kellogg north america). at the beginning of 2019, the company evaluated the related impacted reporting units for impairment on a before and after basis and concluded that the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values.
approximately $46 million of goodwill was re-allocated between the impacted reporting units within kellogg europe and kellogg amea related to the transfer of businesses between these operating segments. the company performed a goodwill evaluation of the impacted reporting units on a before and after basis and concluded that the fair value of the impacted reporting units exceeded their carrying values.
additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, the company determined that it was more likely than not that the company would be selling selected cookies, fruit and fruit-flavored snacks, pie crusts, and ice cream cones businesses within the north america reporting unit. as a result, the company performed a goodwill impairment evaluation on the north america reporting unit in the first quarter of 2019 and concluded that the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. during the second quarter of 2019, the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the businesses to ferrero. the sale was completed during the third quarter of 2019 and resulted in the divestiture of the net assets and liabilities of these businesses, included in the north america reporting unit, including $191 million of goodwill and $765 million of net intangibles. in addition to the cash consideration received, the company entered into a perpetual royalty-free licensing agreement with ferrero, allowing kellogg the use of certain brand names for cracker products. the license agreement was fair valued at $18 million and recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset.
at december 28, 2019, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $8.4 billion, consisting primarily of goodwill and brands originally associated with the 2001 acquisition of keebler foods company and the 2012 acquisition of pringles. within this total, approximately $2.1 billion of non-goodwill intangible assets were classified as indefinite-lived, including $1.7 billion related to trademarks, comprised principally of pringles and cracker-related trademarks. the majority of these intangible assets are recorded in our north america reporting unit. the company currently believes the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds their carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to cash flows. through impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2019, no heightened risk of impairment of individual intangible assets or reporting units was identified.
additionally the company has goodwill of $606 million and $373 million at december 28, 2019 related to the multipro and rx reporting units, respectively. the company performed additional goodwill impairment testing for multipro using both an ebitda market multiple and discounted cash flow method. the company performed additional goodwill impairment testing for rx using both a sales market multiple and discounted cash flow method. significant assumptions utilized within the multipro discounted cash flow model include forecasted net sales growth and gross margin. the significant assumption utilized within the rx discounted cash flow model is forecasted net sales growth. the company determined the fair value of multipro and rx exceed the carrying value and no heightened risk of impairment exists for the reporting units.
retirement benefits our company sponsors a number of u.s. and foreign defined benefit employee pension plans and also provides retiree health care and other welfare benefits in the united states and canada. plan funding strategies are influenced by tax regulations and asset return performance. a majority of plan assets are invested in a globally diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities with smaller holdings of other investments. we recognize the cost of benefits provided during retirement over the employees' active working life to determine the obligations and expense related to our retiree benefit plans. inherent in this concept is the requirement to use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement date. major actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our consolidated benefits expense and accumulated obligation include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the health care cost trend rates, the mortality table and improvement scale, and the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our major plans, which cover employees in the united states, united kingdom and canada.
our expense recognition policy for pension and nonpension postretirement benefits is to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur. actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year-end, or when remeasurement is otherwise required under generally accepted accounting principles.
additionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets related to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits we use the fair value of plan assets.
to conduct our annual review of the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we model expected returns over a 20-year investment horizon with respect to the specific investment mix of each of our major plans. the return assumptions used reflect a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets including consideration of current yields on long-term bonds, price-earnings ratios of the major stock market indices, and long-term inflation. our u.s. plan model, corresponding to approximately 72% of our trust assets globally, currently incorporates a long-term inflation assumption of 2.5% and a 2019 weighted-average active management premium of 0.93% (net of fees) validated by historical analysis and future return expectations. although we review our expected long-term rates of return annually, our benefit trust investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. our expected rates of return have generally not been revised, provided these rates continue to fall within a "more likely than not" corridor of between the 25th and 75th percentile of expected long-term returns, as determined by our modeling process. our assumed rate of return for u.s. plans in 2019 was 7.5% prior to the mid-year remeasurement, and 7.0% after the mid-year remeasurement, based on an updated target portfolio mix with an active management premium of 0.80% (net of fees), equated to approximately the 53rd percentile and 54th percentile expectation of our model, respectively. similar methods are used for various foreign plans with invested assets, reflecting local economic conditions. foreign trust investments represent approximately 28% of our global benefit plan assets.
based on consolidated benefit plan assets at december 28, 2019, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return would correspondingly increase or decrease 2020 benefits expense by approximately $64 million. for the years ended december 28, 2019 and december 29, 2018, our actual return on plan assets exceeded (was less than) the recognized assumed return by $730 million and $(845) million, respectively.
to conduct our annual review of health care cost trend rates, we model our actual claims cost data over a five-year historical period, including an analysis of pre-65 versus post-65 age groups and other important demographic components in our covered retiree population. this data is adjusted to eliminate the impact of plan changes and other factors that would tend to distort the underlying cost inflation trends. our initial health care cost trend rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with recent historical experience and our expectations regarding short-term future trends. in comparison to our actual five-year compound annual claims cost growth rate of approximately 5.12%, our initial trend rate for 2020 of 5.25% reflects the expected future impact of faster-growing claims experience for certain demographic groups within our total employee population. our initial rate is trended downward by 0.25% per year, until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5% is reached. the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. based on consolidated obligations at december 28, 2019, a 100 basis point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase 2020 benefits expense by approximately $3 million and generate an immediate loss recognition of $7 million. a one percent increase in 2020 health care claims cost over that projected from the assumed trend rate would result in an experience loss of approximately $7 million and would increase 2020 expense by $0.3 million. any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the year in which they occur. the experience gain arising from recognition of 2019 claims experience was approximately $15 million.
assumed mortality rates of plan participants are a critical estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant will receive over their lifetime and the amount of expense we recognize. in 2019, the society of actuaries (soa) published updated mortality tables and an updated improvement scale. the expectations of future mortality rates in the new soa tables were consistent with prior kellogg mortality assumptions.  in determining the appropriate mortality assumptions as of 2019 fiscal year-end, we adopted the new soa tables with collar adjustments based on kellogg's current population.  in addition, based on mortality information available from the social security administration and other sources, we developed assumptions for future mortality improvement in line with our expectations for future experience. the change to the mortality assumption impacted the year-end pension and postretirement benefit obligations by $77 million and ($13) million, respectively.
to conduct our annual review of discount rates, we selected the discount rate based on a cash-flow matching analysis using willis towers watson's proprietary rate:link tool and projections of the future benefit payments constituting the projected benefit obligation for the plans. rate:link establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 40th to 90th percentile of u.s. high quality bonds. a similar methodology is applied in canada and europe, except the smaller bond markets imply that yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles are preferable and in the u.k. the underlying yield curve was derived after further adjustments to the universe of bonds to remove government backed bonds. we use a december 31 measurement date for our defined benefit plans. accordingly, we select yield curves to measure our benefit obligations that are consistent with market indices during december of each year.
based on consolidated obligations at december 28, 2019, a 25 basis point decline in the yield curve used for benefit plan measurement purposes would decrease 2020 benefits expense by approximately $8 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of $238 million. all obligation-related actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in the year in which they occur.
despite the previously-described policies for selecting major actuarial assumptions, we periodically experience material actuarial gains or losses due to differences between assumed and actual experience and due to changing economic conditions. during 2019, we recognized a net actuarial loss of approximately $94 million compared to a net actuarial loss of approximately $346 million in 2018. the total net loss recognized in 2019 was driven by a $730 million gain from better than expected asset returns, offset by a loss of approximately $824 million of plan experience and assumption changes, including decreases in the discount rate and the change in mortality assumptions. during 2019, we also recognized curtailment gains of $19 million related to benefit changes and certain events affecting our benefit programs.
during 2019, we made contributions in the amount of $10 million to kellogg's global tax-qualified pension programs. this amount was mostly non-discretionary. additionally, we contributed $18 million to our retiree medical programs.
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. the calculation of our income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment.
we recognize tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. for tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefits as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. the tax position will be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. significant adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits impacting our effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note 13 within notes to consolidated financial statements.
management monitors the company's ability to utilize certain future tax deductions, operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, prior to expiration as well as the reinvestment assertion regarding our undistributed foreign earnings. changes resulting from management's assessment will result in impacts to deferred tax assets and the corresponding impacts on the effective income tax rate. valuation allowances were recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized in the future.
on december 22, 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act includes a provision designed to tax currently global intangible low taxed income (gilti) starting in 2018. under the provision, a u.s. shareholder is required to include in gross income the amount of its gilti, which is 50% of the excess of the shareholder's net tested income of its controlled foreign corporation over the deemed tangible income return. the amount of gilti included by a u.s. shareholder is computed by aggregating all controlled foreign corporations (cfc). shareholders are allowed to claim a foreign tax credit for 80 percent of the taxes paid or accrued with respect to the tested income of each cfc, subject to some limitations.
accounting standards to be adopted in future periods cloud computing arrangements.  in august 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-15: intangibles - goodwill and other - internal-use software: customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. the asu allows companies to capitalize implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract over the term of the hosting arrangement, including periods covered by renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. the asu is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2019 and can be applied retrospectively or prospectively. early adoption is permitted. the company plans to adopt the asu in the first quarter of 2020 and apply it prospectively. the adoption is not expected to have a material impact to the company's consolidated financial statements.
compensation retirement benefits. in august 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-14: disclosure framework-changes to the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans. the asu removed disclosures that no longer are considered cost beneficial, clarified the specific requirements of disclosures, and added disclosure requirements identified as relevant. the asu is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after december 15, 2020 and can be applied retrospectively or prospectively. early adoption is permitted. we are currently assessing when to adopt the asu and the impact of adoption.
future outlook the company issued its initial financial guidance for 2020. specifically, the company is projecting:
currency-neutral adjusted operating profit to decline approximately (4)%, as the absence of the results from the divested businesses more than offsets growth in the base business.
currency-neutral adjusted earnings per share to decline by approximately (3)-(4)%, as the absence of results from the divested businesses more than offset growth in the base business.
non-gaap operating cash flow to improve to $0.9-1.0 billion.
we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential full-year financial impact of mark-to-market adjustments because these impacts are dependent on future changes in market conditions (interest rates, return on assets, and commodity prices). similarly, because of volatility in foreign exchange rates and shifts in country mix of our international earnings, we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential full-year financial impact of foreign currency translation.
as a result, these impacts are not included in the guidance provided. therefore, we are unable to provide a full reconciliation of these non-gaap measures used in our guidance without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on a gaap basis is unavailable, dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company.
see the table below that outlines the projected impact of certain other items that are excluded from non-gaap guidance for 2020:
impact of certain items excluded from non-gaap guidance:   net sales   operating profit   earnings per share business and portfolio realignment (pre-tax)                           ~$60-$70m          ~$0.17-$0.20
income tax impact applicable to adjustments, net**                                        ~$0.04
absence of results from divested businesses                      ~4%
* 2020 full year guidance for net sales, operating profit, and earnings per share are provided on a non-gaap basis only because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a gaap basis is unavailable, dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company. these items for 2020 include impacts of mark-to-market adjustments for pension plans (service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs are not excluded), commodities and certain foreign currency contracts. the company is providing quantification of known adjustment items where available.

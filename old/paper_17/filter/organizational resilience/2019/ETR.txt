risk factors and the other information in this form 10-k. the risks that entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. there may be additional risks and uncertainties
(either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect entergy's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. see " forward-looking information ." utility regulatory risks
(entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy) the terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the utility operating companies and system energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. the utility operating companies are regulated on a cost-of-service and rate of return basis and are subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures. the rates that the utility operating companies and system energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. these rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy and each of the utility operating companies and system energy. these rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment, including adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or affected stakeholders. in addition, regulators may initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the utility operating companies' base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies' operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. the regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute.
the length of these base rate proceedings can cause the utility operating companies and system energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates, such that the utility operating companies may not fully recover all costs during the rate effective period and the utility operating companies may, therefore, earn less than their allowed returns. decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. the utility operating companies have large customer and stakeholder bases and, as a result, could be the subject of public criticism or adverse publicity focused on issues including the operation of their assets and infrastructure or the quality of their service. criticism or adverse publicity of this nature could render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view the applicable operating company in a favorable light and could potentially negatively affect legislative or regulatory processes or outcomes, as well as lead to increased regulatory oversight or more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements. the base rates of entergy texas are established largely in traditional base rate case proceedings. between base rate proceedings, entergy texas has available rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain incremental costs. for example, entergy texas has recovered distribution-related capital investments through the distribution cost recovery factor rider mechanism, transmission-related capital investments and certain non-fuel miso charges through the transmission cost recovery factor rider mechanism, and miso fuel and energy-related costs 276 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy through the fixed fuel factor mechanism. entergy texas is also required to make a filing every three years, at a minimum, reconciling its fuel and purchased power costs and fuel factor revenues. in the course of this reconciliation, the puct determines whether eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and reasonable, and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts for the reconciliation period. between base rate cases, entergy arkansas and entergy mississippi are able to adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize a forward test year (entergy arkansas) or forward-looking features (entergy mississippi). in response to entergy arkansas's application for a general change in rates in 2015, the apsc approved the formula rate plan tariff proposed by entergy arkansas including its use of a projected year test period and an initial five-year term. the initial five-year term expires in 2021 unless entergy arkansas requests, and the apsc approves, the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026. if entergy arkansas's formula rate plan were terminated or not extended beyond the initial term, entergy arkansas could file an application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism. if entergy mississippi's formula rate plan is terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan. entergy arkansas and entergy mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other apsc-approved and mpsc-approved tariffs, respectively.
entergy louisiana historically sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using an historic test year. the form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of entergy louisiana and entergy gulf states louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the lpsc in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in february
2013. the formula rate plan was most recently extended through the test year 2019; certain modifications were made in that extension, including a decrease to the allowed return on equity and the addition of a transmission cost recovery mechanism. the formula rate plan continues to include exceptions from the rate cap and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities and purchase power agreements approved by the lpsc and as noted, for certain transmission investment, among other items. miso fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in entergy louisiana's fuel adjustment clause. in the event that the electric formula rate plan is not renewed or extended, entergy louisiana would revert to the more traditional rate case environment. entergy new orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year. based on a settlement agreement approved by the city council, with limited exceptions, the base rates of entergy new orleans were frozen until rates were implemented in connection with the base rate case filed by entergy new orleans in 2018. in november 2019 the city council issued a resolution resolving the rate case, with rates to become effective retroactive to august 2019. the resolution allows entergy new orleans to implement a three-year formula rate plan, beginning with the 2019 test year as adjusted for forward-
looking known and measurable changes. entergy new orleans has appealed the resolution. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. the rates of system energy are established by the ferc, and the costs allowed to be charged pursuant to these rates are, in turn, passed through to the participating utility operating companies through the unit power sales agreement, which allows monthly adjustments to reflect the current operating costs of, and investment in, grand gulf. the unit power sales agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the ferc, including a challenge with respect to system energy's authorized return on equity and capital structure and a request in a separate proceeding for ferc to initiate a broader investigation of rates under the unit power sales agreement. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. the utility operating companies have agreed to implement certain protocols for providing retail regulators with information regarding rates billed under the unit power sales agreement. the utility operating companies and system energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and 277 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. for information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the utility operating companies, see note 2 to the financial statements. changes to state or federal legislation or regulation affecting electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities could adversely affect entergy and the utility operating companies' financial position, results of operations or cash flows and their utility businesses. if legislative and regulatory structures evolve in a manner that erodes the utility operating companies' exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers, they could lose customers and sales and their results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially affected. additionally, technological advances in energy efficiency and distributed energy resources are reducing the costs of these technologies and together with ongoing state and federal subsidies, the increasing penetration of these technologies could result in reduced sales by the utility operating companies. such loss of sales could put upward pressure on rates, resulting in adverse regulatory actions to mitigate such effects on rates. entergy and the utility operating companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, or the extent and timing of reductions of the cost of distributed energy resources, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations, financial position or cash flows. the utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. the utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs.
regulators may also initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all. the utility operating companies' cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. on occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period's fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. for a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see note 2 to the financial statements. there remains uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the system agreement on the utility operating companies. the utility operating companies historically engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the system agreement, which is a rate schedule that had been approved by the ferc. the system agreement terminated in its entirety on august 31, 2016. there remains uncertainty regarding the long-term effect of the termination of the system agreement on the utility operating companies because of the significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission functions of the utility operating companies and the significant period of time (over 30 years) that it had been in existence. in the absence of the system agreement, there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness of governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve certain issues among the utility operating companies and their retail regulators. in addition, although the system agreement terminated in its entirety in august 2016, there are a number of outstanding system agreement proceedings at the ferc that may require future adjustments, including challenges to 278 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the level and timing of payments made by entergy arkansas under the system agreement. the outcome and timing of these ferc proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. for further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the system agreement, see note 2 to the financial statements. the utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the miso markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. the operation of the utility operating companies' transmission system pursuant to the miso rto tariff and their participation in the miso rto's wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. on december 19, 2013, the utility operating companies integrated into the miso rto. miso maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the miso region, including the utility operating companies. the utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the miso day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the miso tariff and market rules. the utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the miso markets. miso tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the utility operating companies' ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and miso market rules may change in ways that cause additional risk. the utility operating companies participate in the miso regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that miso makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the utility operating companies'
transmission assets that are under miso's functional control. the utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. miso has made filings with ferc proposing changes in the transmission project criteria in miso. these changes, if adopted, could potentially result in a larger volume of competitively bid and regionally cost allocated transmission projects. in addition to the cash and financing-related risks arising from the potential additional cost allocation to the utility operating companies from these projects, there is a risk that the utility operating companies' business and financial position could be harmed as a result of lost investment opportunities and other effects that flow from an increased number of competitive projects being approved and constructed that are interconnected with their transmission systems. further, the terms and conditions of the miso tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets, the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, the miso-wide allowed base rate of return on equity, and any required miso-related charges and credits are subject to regulation by the ferc. the operation of the utility operating companies' transmission system pursuant to the miso tariff and their participation in the miso wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. in addition, orders from each of the utility operating companies' respective retail regulators generally require that the utility operating companies make periodic filings, or generally allow the retail regulator to direct the making of such filings, setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits realized from miso membership as well as the projected costs and benefits of continued membership in miso and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in miso. these filings have been submitted periodically by each of the utility operating companies as required by their respective retail regulators, and the outcome of the resulting proceedings may affect the utility operating companies'
continued membership in miso. 279 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy (entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, and entergy texas) a delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on entergy and those utility operating companies affected by severe weather. entergy's and its utility operating companies' results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the utility operating companies during the period of the outages. a delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on entergy and those utility operating companies affected by severe weather. nuclear operating, shutdown and regulatory risks (entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, and system energy) certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities. nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors, consistent with safety requirements. for the utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their owned or contractually controlled facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. for the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. entergy wholesale commodities'
forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. in the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. further, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm ld basis, which subjects entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. many of these firm hedge products have damages risk. certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel.
plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. if refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be
"turned off." refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages, which typically extends the planned outage duration. when refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease, and maintenance costs may increase. lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause entergy wholesale commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed. 280 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication). these risks could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. based upon currently planned fuel cycles, entergy's nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through 2020 and beyond. the nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the entergy wholesale commodities segment has been adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdown and sale of the palisades, indian point 2 and indian point 3 plants over the next three years and fuel procurement is limited to the final refueling of the palisades plant in 2020 . entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. while there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the u.s. market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past and may be subject to increased volatility due to the imposition of tariffs, domestic purchase requirements or shifting trade arrangements between countries. although entergy's nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price changes could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities. entergy's ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. these service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. for conversion and enrichment services, entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. for fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant's nuclear fuel; therefore, entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as russia, in which international sanctions or tariffs could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services at acceptable prices or at all. the inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities. entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business face the risk that the nrc will change or modify its regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. under the atomic energy act and energy reorganization act, the nrc regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. the nrc may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the atomic energy act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. interested parties may also intervene which could result in prolonged proceedings. a change in the atomic energy act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the nrc's interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of entergy (through entergy wholesale commodities), its utility operating companies, or system energy. a change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the nrc's reactor oversight process, which is the nrc's program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and nrc response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. for additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, system energy, and 281 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the entergy wholesale commodities business, see " regulation of entergy's business - regulation of the nuclear power industry - nrc reactor oversight process " in part i, item 1
and note 8 to the financial statements. events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the nrc's interpretation thereof, or may cause the nrc to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. as a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy, certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, or entergy wholesale commodities. certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. the nuclear generating units owned by certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently. this equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by the utility operating companies and system energy in regulatory proceedings should there be a determination of imprudence. operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by entergy's subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. if this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. a decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. for the utility operating companies and system energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings. for entergy wholesale commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. in addition, the operation and maintenance of entergy's nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs. the nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to the effects of stress corrosion cracking and other corrosion mechanisms on certain materials within plant systems. the issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance. moreover, entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of entergy's nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished, and in some cases, parts are no longer available and have to be reverse-engineered for replacement. in addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. this dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for entergy. the costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. certain of the utility operating companies, system energy and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plants incur costs for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. the approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for yucca mountain, nevada, or 282 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel.
for example, while the doe is required by law to proceed with the licensing of yucca mountain and, after the license is granted by the nrc, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the nrc licensing of the yucca mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. these actions are prolonging the time before spent fuel is removed from entergy's plant sites. because the doe has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and entergy has sued the doe for such breach. furthermore, entergy is uncertain as to when the doe will commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. as a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies' nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities, including aging management of fuel storage casks, may increase. the costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. in addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. for further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the " critical accounting estimates - nuclear decommissioning costs - spent fuel disposal " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, and system energy and note 8 to the financial statements. certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the price-anderson act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the united states and elsewhere. the price-
anderson act limits each reactor owner's public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool, which is referred to as secondary financial protection, up to approximately $137.6 million per reactor. with 98 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $14 billion per incident. the limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. as required by the price-anderson act, the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with american nuclear insurers, which is $450 million for each operating site. claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under secondary financial protection. as a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including entergy's utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $137.6 million per reactor per incident (entergy's maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.101 billion). the retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $21 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $137.6 million cap. neil is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members, including the utility operating companies, system energy, and the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities plants. all member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies)
should the neil surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to insured losses. as of december 31, 2019, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $112 million for the utility plants. retrospective premium insurance available through neil's reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments and the entergy wholesale commodities plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover those potential assessments. as an owner of nuclear power plants, entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition,
283 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy or liquidity of entergy, certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, or the entergy wholesale commodities subsidiaries. the decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by the utility operating companies, system energy and the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, if one or more of entergy's nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, if the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require significant additional funding. owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. certain of the utility operating companies, system energy, and owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose.
certain of the utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. under nrc regulations, nuclear plant owners are permitted to project the nrc-required decommissioning amount, based on an nrc formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount that will be available in each nuclear power plant's decommissioning trusts combined with any other decommissioning financial assurances in place. the projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used. if the projected amount of each individual plant's decommissioning trusts exceeds the nrc-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with nrc regulations. if the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs required to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources or commitments would be required. furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the nrc may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the nrc's formula. the nrc may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. in addition to nrc requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy. further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of the utility operating companies, system energy, or entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts. such changes also could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. as a result, under any of these circumstances, entergy's results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected. an early plant shutdown (either generally or relative to current expectations), poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs (including as a result of changing regulatory requirements) could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the utility operating companies, system energy or the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide significant additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning, which, with respect to the utility operating companies, may not be recoverable from customers in a timely fashion or at all.

new and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel. these concerns have led to, and may continue to lead to, various proposals to federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where entergy's subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that might lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, additional requirements or restrictions related to spent nuclear fuel on-site storage and eventual disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating and decommissioning nuclear generating units. entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. if any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations and financial condition. (entergy corporation) entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk.
entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-
utility businesses. as a result, the sale of capacity and energy from the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. in order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, entergy wholesale commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and firm ld and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. as of december 31, 2019, entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 97% in 2020, 92% in 2021, and 66% in 2022
of its generation portfolio's planned energy output, reflecting the planned shutdown and sale of the remaining entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants by mid-2022. market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. the obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. for some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. firm ld sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices. market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. during periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. the effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power regions where the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants are located. in addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region. these conditions were primary 285 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy factors leading to entergy's decision to shut down (or sell) entergy wholesale commodities' nuclear power plants before the end of their operating licenses (or requested operating licenses for indian point 2 and indian point 3). the price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, entergy wholesale commodities' contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect entergy wholesale commodities' results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. new hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-
performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. see the "
market and credit risk sensitive instruments " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries. since entergy wholesale commodities has announced the closure (or sale) of its nuclear plants, entergy wholesale commodities may enter into fewer forward sales contracts for output from such plants. the entergy wholesale commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. the entergy wholesale commodities business is subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and local laws. compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the entergy wholesale commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. public utilities under the federal power act are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. each of the owners of the entergy wholesale commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as entergy nuclear power marketing, llc, is a "public utility" under the federal power act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. the ferc has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. the ferc's orders that grant the entergy wholesale commodities' generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the ferc subsequently determines that the entergy wholesale commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. in addition, the entergy wholesale commodities' market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1
million per day per violation. if the entergy wholesale commodities' generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the ferc's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. this could have an adverse effect on the rates the entergy wholesale commodities business charges for power from its facilities. the entergy wholesale commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing independent system operators.
the independent system operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets may impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. these types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the entergy wholesale commodities business' generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. for further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the entergy wholesale commodities business, see the " regulation of entergy's business " section in part i, item 1. 286 table of contents part i item
1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the entergy wholesale commodities business. in addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, and have made proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. if competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the entergy wholesale commodities business' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. the power plants owned by the entergy wholesale commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain.
generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. projected net cash flows depend on the expected operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. in particular, the remaining assets of the entergy wholesale commodities business are subject to further impairment in connection with the closure and sale of its nuclear power plants. moreover, prior to the closure and sale of these plants, the failure of the entergy wholesale commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, a reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit, or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential additional impairment charges for the affected assets. if entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its planned shutdown date, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in a further impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. any impairment charge taken by entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the remaining power plants owned by the entergy wholesale commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on entergy's results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. for further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the " critical accounting estimates - impairment of long-lived assets and trust fund investments " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy corporation and subsidiaries and for further discussion of the impairment charges, see note 14 to the financial statements. general business (entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, and entergy texas) entergy and the utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. entergy's business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and 287 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy other terms. at times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the utility operating companies and entergy wholesale commodities. in addition, entergy's and the utility operating companies' liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in entergy's service territory with hurricane katrina and hurricane rita in 2005, hurricane gustav and hurricane ike in 2008, and hurricane isaac in 2012. the occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, changes in regulation or governmental policy (including tax and trade policy), or other unknown events, could cause the financing needs of entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. in addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of entergy and the utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of high interest rates, and uncertainty or reduced liquidity in the capital markets, could negatively affect entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. access to capital markets could be restricted and/or borrowing costs could be increased due to certain sources of debt and equity capital being unwilling to invest in companies that experience extreme weather events, that rely on fossil fuels or offerings to fund fossil fuel projects, or due to risks related to climate change. events beyond entergy's control may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities.
entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. if entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit entergy corporation's ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. (entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, entergy texas, and system energy) a downgrade in entergy corporation ' s or its subsidiaries ' credit ratings could negatively affect entergy corporation ' s and its subsidiaries ' ability to access capital and/or could require entergy corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. there are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of entergy corporation and the registrant subsidiaries, including each registrant's regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. if one or more rating agencies downgrade entergy corporation's, any of the utility operating companies', or system energy's ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. most of entergy corporation's and its subsidiaries' suppliers and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. if entergy corporation's or its subsidiaries'
ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe entergy corporation or the utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with entergy corporation or its subsidiaries. at december 31, 2019, based on power prices at that time, entergy had liquidity exposure of $78 million under the guarantees in place supporting entergy wholesale commodities transactions and $19 million of posted cash collateral. in the event of a decrease in entergy corporation's credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as 288 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy of december 31, 2019, entergy would have been required to provide approximately $30 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. as of december 31, 2019, the liquidity exposure associated with entergy wholesale commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted collateral from counterparties, would increase by $90 million for a $1 per mmbtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. recent u.s. tax legislation may materially adversely affect entergy's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. the tax cuts and jobs act of
2017 significantly changed the u.s. internal revenue code, including taxation of u.s. corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. the legislation and interpretive guidance from the irs are unclear in certain respects and will require further interpretations and implementing regulations by the irs, as well as state tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. as further described in note 3 to the financial statements, as a result of amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes and payment of such amounts to customers in 2019, entergy's net regulatory liability for income taxes balance is $1.7 billion as of december 31, 2019. depending on the outcome of irs examinations or tax positions and elections that entergy may make, entergy and the registrant subsidiaries may be required to record additional charges or credits to income tax expense. further, there may be other material effects resulting from the legislation that have not been identified. for further information regarding the effects of the act, see the " income tax legislation " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy. also, note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the act on 2017, 2018 and 2019 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the act, and note 2 to the financial statements discusses the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the act. changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact entergy's, the utility operating companies', and system energy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. these tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. these judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect entergy's, the utility operating companies', and system energy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. for further information regarding entergy's income taxes, see note 3 to the financial statements. entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to successfully execute on their business strategies, including their ability to complete strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, and, as a result, they may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated results of such strategies, which could materially affect their future prospects, results of operations and benefits that they anticipate from such transactions. entergy and its subsidiaries' future prospects and results of operations significantly depend on their ability to successfully implement their business strategies, which are subject to business, regulatory, economic and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond their control. as a result, entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to fully achieve the anticipated results of such strategies. 289 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy additionally, entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. for example, entergy has entered into an agreement to sell its equity interests in the subsidiary that owns the palisades nuclear plant and the decommissioned big rock point nuclear power plant and an agreement to sell the equity interests of indian point 1, indian point 2, and indian point 3, in each case after each of the plants has been shut down and defueled. also, a significant portion of entergy's utility business over the next several years includes the construction and /or purchase of a variety of generating units. these transactions and plans are or may become subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. the failure to complete these transactions or plans or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on entergy's or its subsidiaries' financial condition or results of operations and the market's perception of entergy's ability to execute its strategy. further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following:
•  acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;
•  acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;
•  entergy may experience issues integrating businesses into its internal controls over financial reporting;
•  the disposition of a business, including entergy's planned exit from the merchant power business, could divert management's attention from other business concerns;
•  to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and
•  entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all.
entergy and its subsidiaries may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that they may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material effect on their business, financial condition or results of operations. the completion of capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, and other capital improvements involve substantial risks. should such efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of entergy and the utility operating companies could be materially affected. entergy's and the utility operating companies' ability to complete capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, or make other capital improvements, in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. these variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise, escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance, and reliance on suppliers for timely and satisfactory performance. delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, levels of public support or opposition, suppliers and contractors not performing as expected or required under their contracts and/or experiencing financial problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations under contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the utility operating companies or the entergy wholesale commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. if these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, entergy and the utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. in addition, the utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of the project or new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost. 290 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy for further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with capital projects, including the potential construction and/or purchase of additional generation supply sources within the utility operating companies'
service territory, and as to the entergy wholesale commodities business, see the " capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy and each of the registrant subsidiaries. failure to attract, retain and manage an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively affect entergy or its subsidiaries' results of operations. we rely on a large and changing workforce of team members, including employees, contractors and temporary staffing. certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatching of skill sets, failing to appropriately anticipate future workforce needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. the challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the time required for skill development. in this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may increase. failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized, technology-enabled power grid. if entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to successfully attract, retain and manage an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected. the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. the businesses in which the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. these laws and regulations affect the manner in which the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. these laws and regulations also affect how the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, certain migratory birds and eagles, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. violations of these requirements can subject the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards.
in addition, the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the utility operating companies, system energy, and entergy wholesale commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. the utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. in addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the epa often are challenged legally, or are revised or withdrawn by the epa, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. risks relating to 291 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below. entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. for further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the " regulation of entergy ' s business - environmental regulation " section of part i, item 1. the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards.
entergy's business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. such standards, which are established by the nerc, the serc, and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the ferc and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards.
the standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. in addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the utility operating companies'
transmission system and generation assets. in addition, the retail regulators of the utility operating companies possess the jurisdiction, and in some cases have exercised such jurisdiction, to impose standards governing the reliable operation of the utility operating companies' distribution systems, including penalties if these standards are not met. the changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its utility and entergy wholesale commodities businesses. (entergy corporation, entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, entergy new orleans, and entergy texas) weather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors may have a material impact on electricity and gas usage and otherwise materially affect the utility operating companies ' results of operations. temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. as a corollary, mild temperatures in either season tend to decrease energy usage and resulting revenues. higher consumption levels coupled with seasonal pricing differentials typically cause the utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters.
extreme weather conditions including hurricanes or tropical storms, flooding events, or ice storms may stress the utility operating companies' generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and reduced customer satisfaction. these extreme conditions could have a material effect on the utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. entergy's electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors including weather and economic conditions, trends in energy efficiency, new technologies and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their grid demand. some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on entergy's operating results. others, such as the organic turnover of appliances and their replacement with more efficient ones, adoption of newer technologies including smart thermostats, new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side management, and rooftop solar are having a more permanent effect by reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. as a result of these emerging efficiencies and technologies, the utility operating companies may lose customers or experience lower average use per customer in the residential and commercial classes, and continuing advances have the potential to further limit sales growth in the future. the 292 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy utility operating companies also may face competition from other companies offering products and services to entergy's customers. electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity markets; however, industrial sales are sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. negative changes in any of these or other factors, particularly sustained economic downturns or sluggishness, have the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect entergy's and the utility operating companies' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. the effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or increase clean or renewable energy requirements or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of entergy, the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business. in an effort to address climate change concerns, some federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. for example, in response to the united states supreme court's 2007 decision holding that the epa has authority to regulate emissions of co 2 and other "greenhouse gases" under the clean air act, the epa, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations focused considerable attention on co 2
emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. in 2010, the epa promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. during 2012 and 2014, the epa proposed co 2 emission standards for new and existing sources. the epa finalized these standards in 2015; however, in june 2019, the epa repealed and replaced certain aspects of those regulations. as examples of state action, in the northeast, the regional greenhouse gas initiative establishes a cap on co 2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their co 2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in california. the impact that continued changes in the governmental response to climate change risk will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions is currently unclear. developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction or clean/renewable energy requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects. the operations of low or non-emitting generating units (such as nuclear units) at lower than expected capacity factors could require increased generation from higher emitting units, thus increasing the company's greenhouse gas emission rate. moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. these requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the utility operating companies, system energy, or entergy wholesale commodities do business. violations of such requirements may subject entergy wholesale commodities and the utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. to the extent entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by entergy's regulators and, in extreme cases, entergy's regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of co 2 and other greenhouse gases or mix of generation sources could (i) result in significant additional costs to entergy's utility operating companies, their suppliers or customers, (ii) make some of entergy's electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, (iii) result in the early retirement of generation facilities and stranded costs if entergy's utility operating companies are unable to fully recover the costs and investment in generation and (iv) could increase the difficulty that entergy and its utility operating companies have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, each of which could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of entergy and its subsidiaries. in addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. these lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 293 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy in addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wildfires, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands.
a significant portion of the nation's oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by the physical impacts of climate change, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations. these and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the entergy system's ability to meet peak customer demand, more frequent and longer lasting outages, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on entergy's, entergy wholesale commodities', system energy's, and the utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the utility operating companies, system energy, and the entergy wholesale commodities business. water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the utility operating companies', system energy's, and entergy wholesale commodities' business operations. entergy's facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. entergy's utility operating companies also own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to entergy's business operations. impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the clean water act and/or state water pollution control provisions. regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. the increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect entergy and its subsidiaries. entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
to manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, entergy and its subsidiaries, including the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. as part of this strategy, entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-
the-counter markets or on exchanges. however, entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. in addition, entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. to the extent entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, 294 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations and financial position. although entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. as a result of these and other factors, entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position.
entergy's over-the-counter financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse. entergy cannot predict the impact any proposed or not fully-implemented final rules will have on its ability to hedge its commodity price risk or on over-the-counter derivatives markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material effect on entergy's risk exposure, as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities. entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. reductions in entergy's or its subsidiaries' credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect entergy's or its subsidiaries' liquidity and financial position. the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the utility operating companies and entergy wholesale commodities.
the hedging and risk management practices of the utility operating companies and the entergy wholesale commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to entergy or its subsidiaries. if the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. in such event, entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. in addition, the credit commitments of entergy's lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to entergy's benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. as the value of the assets decreases, the "expected return on assets" component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs.
additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs.
volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect entergy's planned levels of contributions in the future. additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or federal regulations. for further information regarding entergy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the " critical accounting estimates -
qualified pension and other postretirement benefits " section of management's financial discussion and analysis for entergy and each of its registrant subsidiaries and note 11 to the financial statements. 295 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy the litigation environment in the states in which certain entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. the states in which the utility operating companies operate, in particular louisiana, mississippi, and texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk.
terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, system failures or data breaches of entergy's and its subsidiaries' or our suppliers' technology systems may adversely affect entergy's results of operations. entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a business that requires evolving information technology systems that include sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software, network infrastructure and other technologies that are becoming more complex and may be subject to mandatory and prescriptive reliability and security standards. the functionality of entergy's technology systems depends on its own and its suppliers' and their contractors' technology. suppliers'
and their contractors' technology systems to which entergy is connected directly or indirectly support a variety of business processes and activities to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of customers and employees, and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems could result in loss of data or disruptions of operations. there have been attacks and threats of attacks on energy infrastructure by cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments. as an operator of critical infrastructure, entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, cyber attacks, and data breaches, whether as a direct or indirect act against one of entergy's generation, transmission or distribution facilities, operations centers, infrastructure, or information technology systems used to manage, monitor, and transport power to customers and perform day-to-day business functions. an actual act could affect entergy's ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct business. given the rapid technological advancements of existing and emerging threats, entergy's technology systems remain inherently vulnerable despite implementations and enhancements of the multiple layers of security and controls. if entergy's or its subsidiaries' technology systems were compromised and unable to detect or recover in a timely fashion to a normal state of operations, entergy or its subsidiaries could be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company's well-being and could result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, suppliers, and others in entergy's care. although malware was discovered on entergy's business network in 2018, it was remediated on a timely basis and did not affect entergy's operational systems, generation plants
(including nuclear), or transmission and distribution networks, nor did it have a material effect on entergy's business operations. any such attacks, failures or data breaches could have a material effect on entergy's and the utility operating companies' business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. insurance may not be adequate to cover losses that might arise in connection with these events. such events may also expose entergy to an increased risk of litigation (and associated damages and fines). 296 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy (entergy new orleans) the effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect entergy new orleans's results of operations and liquidity. gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to entergy new orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. distribution charges recover fixed costs on a volumetric basis and, thus, are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. when purchased gas cost charges increase due to higher gas procurement costs, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for entergy new orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations. purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer's bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that entergy new orleans recovers from its customers. entergy new orleans's cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. (system energy) system energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. system energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in grand gulf. charges under the unit power sales agreement are paid by the utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. the useful economic life of grand gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which expires in november 2044. system energy's financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the utility operating companies under the unit power sales agreement and on the continued commercial operation of grand gulf. the unit power sales agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the ferc, including a challenge with respect to system energy's authorized return on equity and capital structure and a request in separate proceeding for ferc to initiate a broader investigation of rates under the unit power sales agreement. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. the utility operating companies have agreed to implement certain protocols for providing retail regulators with information regarding rates billed under the unit power sales agreement. for information regarding the unit power sales agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the entergy system companies' support of system energy, see notes 8 and 10 to the financial statements and the "
utility - system energy and related agreements " section of part i, item 1. (entergy corporation) as a holding company, entergy corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. entergy corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries.
accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. entergy corporation's ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. the subsidiaries of entergy corporation are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make distributions to entergy corporation. the ability of such subsidiaries to make payments of dividends or distributions to entergy corporation depends on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries' ability to pay such dividends or distributions. prior to providing funds to entergy corporation, such subsidiaries have financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and, in the case of entergy utility holding company and entergy texas, dividends and distributions on preferred securities. any distributions from the registrant subsidiaries other than entergy texas and system energy 297 table of contents part i item 1a & 1b entergy corporation, utility operating companies, and system energy are paid directly to entergy utility holding company and are therefore subject to prior payment of distributions on its preferred securities. 298 table of contents entergy arkansas, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations 2019 compared to 2018 net income net income increased $10.3 million primarily due to higher retail electric price and lower nuclear refueling outage expenses, partially offset by lower volume/weather, higher interest expense, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. operating revenues following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2019 to 2018:
2018 operating revenues                                  $2,060.6
significantly affect net income return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred           241.4
income taxes to customers retail electric price                                        66.7
2019 operating revenues                                  $2,259.6
entergy arkansas's results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. "fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income" includes the revenue variance associated with these items. the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers resulted from the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through a tax adjustment rider beginning in april 2018. in 2019, $126.3 million was returned to customers as compared to $367.7 million in 2018.
there was no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues in each period was offset by a reduction in income tax expense. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the tax cuts and jobs act. the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan rates effective with the first billing cycle of january 2019, as approved by the apsc. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan filing. the volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 707 gwh, or 3%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of less favorable weather on residential and commercial sales and a decrease in industrial usage. the decrease in industrial usage is primarily due to a decrease in small industrial sales. other income statement variances nuclear refueling outage expenses decreased primarily due to the amortization of lower costs associated with the most recent outages as compared to previous outages. 299 table of contents entergy arkansas, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
•  a decrease of $20.2 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work performed in 2019 as compared to 2018;
the effects of recording in 2019 a final judgment to resolve claims in the ano damages case against the doe
•  related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs.  the damages awarded include the reimbursement of approximately
$11.9 million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense.  see note 8 to the financial statements for discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation; and
•  a decrease of $5.5 millionin vegetation maintenance costs.
the decrease was partially offset by:
•  an $11.2 million write-off in 2019 of specific costs related to the potential construction of scrubbers at the white bluff plant;
•  an increase of $8.5 million in information technology expenses primarily due to higher costs related to applications and infrastructure support, enhanced cyber security, and upgrades and maintenance;
•  an increase of $7.4 million due to spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services;
•  an increase of $5.5 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation accruals in 2019 as compared to prior year.
the increase in local franchise taxes is primarily due to higher electric retail revenues. the increase in ad valorem taxes is primarily due to higher assessments and millage rates. depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service and an increase in the ano 1 and ano 2 asset retirement cost assets. see note 9 to the financial statements for discussion of the increase in the asset retirement cost assets. interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $350 million of 4.20% series mortgage bonds in march 2019 and the issuance of $250 million of 4.00% series mortgage bonds in may 2018. the effective income tax rates were (21.6%) for 2019 and 669.7% for 2018. the differences in the effective income tax rates versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of
21% to the effective income tax rates. 2018 compared to 2017 see " management's financial discussion and analysis -

net debt to net capital, excluding securitization  53.0%               51.8%
net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt and equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. entergy arkansas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy arkansas's financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to entergy arkansas, as more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements. entergy arkansas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy arkansas's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy arkansas's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. entergy arkansas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy arkansas may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure. in addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, entergy arkansas may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure. uses of capital entergy arkansas requires capital resources for:

million. in october 2017, entergy arkansas filed with the apsc revised formula rate plan attachments that projected a $126.2 million revenue requirement increase based on acceptance of certain adjustments and recommendations made by the apsc staff and other intervenors. the revised formula rate plan filing included a proposed $71.1 million revenue requirement increase based on a revision to the four percent constraint calculation. in october 2017, entergy arkansas and the parties to the proceeding filed a joint motion to approve a unanimous settlement agreement resolving all issues in the proceeding and providing for recovery of certain 2017 and 2018 nuclear costs. in december 2017 the apsc approved the settlement agreement and the $71.1 million revenue requirement increase, as well as entergy arkansas's formula rate plan compliance tariff, and the rates became effective with the first billing cycle of january 2018. 2018 formula rate plan filing in july 2018, entergy arkansas filed with the apsc its
2018 formula rate plan filing to set its formula rate for the 2019 calendar year. the filing showed entergy arkansas's projected earned return on common equity for the twelve months ended december 31, 2019 test period to be below the formula rate plan bandwidth. additionally, the filing includes the first netting adjustment under the current formula rate plan for the historical test year 2017, reflecting the change in formula rate plan revenues associated with actual 2017 results when compared to the allowed rate of return on equity. the filing includes a projected $73.4 million revenue deficiency for 2019 and a $95.6 million revenue deficiency for the 2017 historical test year, for a total revenue requirement of $169 million for this filing. by operation of the formula rate plan, entergy arkansas's recovery of the revenue requirement is subject to a four percent annual revenue constraint.
because entergy arkansas's revenue requirement in this filing exceeds the constraint, the resulting increase is limited to four percent of total revenue, which originally was $65.4 million but was increased to $66.7 million based upon the apsc staff's updated calculation of 2018 revenue. in october 2018, entergy arkansas and the parties to the proceeding filed joint motions to approve a partial settlement agreement as to certain factual issues and agreed to brief contested legal issues. in november 2018 the apsc held a hearing and was briefed on a certain contested legal issue. in december 2018 the apsc issued a decision related to the initial legal brief, approved the

$46.6 million in the 2018 historical year netting adjustment. during 2018 entergy arkansas experienced higher-than expected sales volume, and actual costs were lower than forecasted. these changes, coupled with a reduced income tax rate resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act, resulted in the credit for the historical year netting adjustment. in the fourth quarter 2018 entergy arkansas recorded a provision of $35.1 million that reflected the estimate of the historical year netting adjustment that was expected to be included in the 2019 filing. in 2019, entergy arkansas recorded additional provisions totaling $11.5 million to reflect the updated estimate of the historical year netting adjustment included in the 2019 filing. in october 2019 other parties in the proceeding filed their errors and objections requesting certain adjustments to entergy arkansas's filing that would reduce or eliminate entergy arkansas's proposed revenue change. entergy arkansas filed its response addressing the requested adjustments in october 2019. in its response, entergy arkansas accepted certain of the adjustments recommended by the general staff of the apsc that would reduce the proposed formula rate plan rider revenue change to $14 million.
entergy arkansas disputed the remaining adjustments proposed by the parties. in october 2019, entergy arkansas filed a unanimous settlement agreement with the other parties in the proceeding seeking apsc approval of a revised total formula rate plan rider revenue change of $10.1 million. in its july 2019 formula rate plan filing, entergy arkansas proposed to recover an $11.2 million regulatory asset, amortized over five years, associated with specific costs related to the potential construction of scrubbers at the white bluff plant. although entergy arkansas does not concede that the regulatory asset lacks merit, for purposes of reaching a settlement on the total formula rate plan rider amount, entergy arkansas agreed not to include the white bluff scrubber regulatory asset cost in the
2019 formula rate plan filing or future filings. entergy arkansas recorded a write-off in 2019 of the $11.2 million white bluff scrubber regulatory asset. in december 2019, the apsc approved the settlement as being in the public interest and approved entergy arkansas's compliance tariff effective with the first billing cycle of january 2020.
internal restructuring in november 2017, entergy arkansas filed an application with the apsc seeking authorization to undertake a restructuring that would result in the transfer of substantially all of the assets and operations of entergy arkansas to a new entity, which would ultimately be owned by an existing entergy subsidiary holding company. in july 2018, entergy arkansas filed a settlement, reached by all parties in the apsc proceeding, resolving all issues. the apsc approved the settlement agreement and restructuring in august 2018. pursuant to the settlement agreement, entergy arkansas will credit retail customers $39.6 million over six years, beginning in
2019. entergy arkansas also received the required ferc and nrc approvals. in november 2018, entergy arkansas undertook a multi-step restructuring, including the following:
•  entergy arkansas, inc. redeemed its outstanding preferred stock at the aggregate redemption price of approximately$32.7 million.

way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems. ami is intended to serve as the foundation of entergy arkansas's modernized power grid.
the filing included an estimate of implementation costs for ami of $208 million and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits. entergy arkansas proposed a 15-year depreciable life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which began in january 2019. deployment of the communications network began in
2018. in october 2017 the apsc issued an order finding that entergy arkansas's ami deployment is in the public interest and approving the settlement agreement subject to a minor modification. entergy arkansas is recovering the ami deployment costs and the quantified benefits through its formula rate plan. entergy arkansas will recover the undepreciated balance of its existing meters through a regulatory asset to be amortized over 15 years, as approved by the apsc. production cost allocation rider the apsc approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to entergy arkansas as a result of the system agreement proceedings, which are discussed in the " system agreement cost equalization proceedings " section in note 2 to the financial statements. energy cost recovery rider entergy arkansas's retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs in monthly customer bills. the rider utilizes the prior calendar-
year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on april 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-
or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy costs for the prior calendar year. the energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. in january 2014, entergy arkansas filed a motion with the apsc relating to its upcoming energy cost rate redetermination filing that was made in march 2014. in that motion, entergy arkansas requested that the apsc authorize entergy arkansas to exclude from the redetermination of its 2014 energy cost rate
$65.9 million of incremental fuel and replacement energy costs incurred in 2013 as a result of the ano stator incident. entergy arkansas requested that the apsc authorize entergy arkansas to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance, with recovery to be reviewed in a later period after more information was available regarding various claims associated with the ano stator incident. in february 2014 the apsc approved entergy arkansas's request to retain that amount in its deferred fuel balance. in july 2017, entergy arkansas filed for a change in rates pursuant to its formula rate plan rider. in that proceeding, the apsc approved a settlement agreement agreed upon by the parties, including a provision that requires entergy arkansas to initiate a regulatory proceeding for the purpose of recovering funds currently withheld from rates and related to the stator incident, including the $65.9
million of deferred fuel and purchased energy costs previously noted, subject to 308 table of contents entergy arkansas, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis certain timelines and conditions set forth in the settlement agreement. see the " ano damage, outage, and nrc reviews " section in note 8 to the financial statements for further discussion of the ano stator incident. in march 2017, entergy arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from $0.01164 per kwh to $0.01547 per kwh. the apsc staff filed testimony in march 2017
recommending that the redetermined rate be implemented with the first billing cycle of april 2017 under the normal operation of the tariff. accordingly, the redetermined rate went into effect on march 31, 2017 pursuant to the tariff. in july 2017 the arkansas attorney general requested additional information to support certain of the costs included in entergy arkansas's 2017 energy cost rate redetermination. in march 2018, entergy arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected an increase in the rate from $0.01547 per kwh to $0.01882 per kwh. the arkansas attorney general filed a response to entergy arkansas's annual redetermination filing requesting that the apsc suspend the proposed tariff to investigate the amount of the redetermination or, alternatively, to allow recovery subject to refund. among the reasons the attorney general cited for suspension were questions pertaining to how entergy arkansas forecasted sales and potential implications of the tax act. entergy arkansas replied to the attorney general's filing and stated that, to the extent there are questions pertaining to its load forecasting or the operation of the energy cost recovery rider, those issues exceed the scope of the instant rate redetermination. entergy arkansas also stated that potential effects of the tax act are appropriately considered in the apsc's separate proceeding regarding potential implications of the tax law. the apsc general staff filed a reply to the attorney general's filing and agreed that entergy arkansas's filing complied with the terms of the energy cost recovery rider. the redetermined rate became effective with the first billing cycle of april 2018. subsequently in april 2018 the apsc issued an order declining to suspend entergy arkansas's energy cost recovery rider rate and declining to require further investigation at that time of the issues suggested by the attorney general in the proceeding. following a period of discovery, the attorney general filed a supplemental response in october 2018 raising new issues with entergy arkansas's march 2018 rate redetermination and asserting that $45.7 million of the increase should be collected subject to refund pending further investigation. entergy arkansas filed to dismiss the attorney general's supplemental response, the apsc general staff filed a motion to strike the attorney general's filing, and the attorney general filed a supplemental response disputing entergy arkansas and the apsc staff's filing. applicable apsc rules and processes authorize its general staff to initiate periodic audits of entergy arkansas's energy cost recovery rider. in late-2018, the apsc general staff notified entergy arkansas it has initiated an audit of the
2017 fuel costs. the time in which the audit will be complete is uncertain at this time. in march 2019, entergy arkansas filed its annual redetermination of its energy cost rate pursuant to the energy cost recovery rider, which reflected a decrease from $0.01882 per kwh to $0.01462 per kwh and became effective with the first billing cycle in april 2019. in march 2019 the arkansas attorney general filed a response to entergy arkansas's annual adjustment and included with its filing a motion for investigation of alleged overcharges to customers in connection with the ferc's october 2018 order in the opportunity sales proceeding. entergy arkansas filed its response to the attorney general's motion in april 2019 in which entergy arkansas stated its intent to initiate a proceeding to address recovery issues related to the october 2018 ferc order. in may 2019, entergy arkansas initiated the opportunity sales recovery proceeding, discussed below, and requested that the apsc establish that proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which interested parties may assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate treatment of the ferc october 2018 order and related ferc orders in the opportunity sales proceeding. in june 2019
the apsc granted entergy arkansas's request and also denied the attorney general's motion in the energy cost recovery proceeding seeking an investigation into entergy arkansas's annual energy cost recovery rider adjustment and referred the evaluation of such matters to the opportunity sales recovery proceeding. 309 table of contents entergy arkansas, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis opportunity sales proceeding in june 2009 the lpsc filed a complaint requesting that the ferc determine that certain of entergy arkansas's sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the system agreement that allocated the energy generated by entergy system resources; (b) imprudently denied the entergy system and its ultimate consumers the benefits of low-cost entergy system generating capacity; and (c) violated the provision of the system agreement that prohibited sales to third parties by individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other utility operating companies. the lpsc's complaint challenged sales made beginning in 2002 and requested refunds. in july 2009 the utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint arguing among other things that the system agreement contemplates that the utility operating companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the applicable utility operating company. the ferc subsequently ordered a hearing in the proceeding. after a hearing, the alj issued an initial decision in december 2010. the alj found that the system agreement allowed for entergy arkansas to make the sales to third parties but concluded that the sales should be accounted for in the same manner as joint account sales. the alj concluded that "shareholders" should make refunds of the damages to the utility operating companies, along with interest. entergy disagreed with several aspects of the alj's initial decision and in january
2011 filed with the ferc exceptions to the decision. the ferc issued a decision in june 2012 and held that, while the system agreement is ambiguous, it does provide authority for individual utility operating companies to make opportunity sales for their own account and entergy arkansas made and priced these sales in good faith. the ferc found, however, that the system agreement does not provide authority for an individual utility operating company to allocate the energy associated with such opportunity sales as part of its load but provides a different allocation authority. the ferc further found that the after-the-fact accounting methodology used to allocate the energy used to supply the sales was inconsistent with the system agreement. the ferc in its decision established further hearing procedures to quantify the effect of repricing the opportunity sales in accordance with the ferc's june
2012 decision. the hearing was held in may 2013 and the alj issued an initial decision in august 2013. the lpsc, the apsc, the city council, and ferc staff filed briefs on exceptions and/or briefs opposing exceptions. entergy filed a brief on exceptions requesting that the ferc reverse the initial decision and a brief opposing certain exceptions taken by the lpsc and ferc staff. in april 2016 the ferc issued orders addressing requests for rehearing filed in july 2012 and the alj's august 2013 initial decision. the first order denied entergy's request for rehearing and affirmed the ferc's earlier rulings that entergy's original methodology for allocating energy costs to the opportunity sales was incorrect and, as a result, entergy arkansas must make payments to the other utility operating companies to put them in the same position that they would have been in absent the incorrect allocation.
the ferc clarified that interest should be included with the payments. the second order affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the rulings in the alj's august 2013 initial decision regarding the methodology that should be used to calculate the payments entergy arkansas is to make to the other utility operating companies. the ferc affirmed the alj's ruling that a full re-run of intra-system bills should be performed but required that methodology be modified so that the sales have the same priority for purposes of energy allocation as joint account sales. the ferc reversed the alj's decision that any payments by entergy arkansas should be reduced by 20% . the ferc also reversed the alj's decision that adjustments to other system agreement service schedules and excess bandwidth payments should not be taken into account when calculating the payments to be made by entergy arkansas.
the ferc held that such adjustments and excess bandwidth payments should be taken into account but ordered further proceedings before an alj to address whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology. in may 2016, entergy services filed a request for rehearing of the ferc's april 2016 order arguing that payments made by entergy arkansas should be reduced as a result of the timing of the lpsc's approval of certain contracts. entergy services also filed a request for clarification and/or rehearing of the ferc's april 2016 order addressing the alj's august 2013 initial decision.
the apsc and the lpsc also filed requests for rehearing of the ferc's april 2016 order. in september 2017 the ferc issued an order denying the request for rehearing on the issue 310 table of contents entergy arkansas, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis of whether any payments by entergy arkansas to the other utility operating companies should be reduced due to the timing of the lpsc's approval of entergy arkansas's wholesale baseload contract with entergy louisiana. in november 2017 the ferc issued an order denying all of the remaining requests for rehearing of the april 2016 order. in november 2017, entergy services filed a petition for review in the d.c. circuit of the ferc's orders in the first two phases of the opportunity sales case. in december
2017 the d.c. circuit granted entergy services' request to hold the appeal in abeyance pending final resolution of the related proceeding before the ferc. in january 2018 the apsc and the lpsc filed separate petitions for review in the d.c. circuit, and the d.c. circuit consolidated the appeals with entergy services' appeal and held all of the appeals in abeyance pending final resolution of the related proceeding before the ferc. the hearing required by the ferc's april 2016 order was held in may 2017. in july 2017 the alj issued an initial decision addressing whether a cap on any reduction due to bandwidth payments was necessary and whether to implement the other adjustments to the calculation methodology. in august 2017 the utility operating companies, the lpsc, the apsc, and ferc staff filed individual briefs on exceptions challenging various aspects of the initial decision. in september
2017 the utility operating companies, the lpsc, the apsc, the mpsc, the city council, and ferc staff filed separate briefs opposing exceptions taken by various parties. based on testimony previously submitted in the case and its assessment of the april 2016 ferc orders, in the first quarter 2016, entergy arkansas recorded a liability of $87
million, which included interest, for its estimated increased costs and payment to the other utility operating companies, and a deferred fuel regulatory asset of $75 million. following its assessment of the course of the proceedings, including the ferc's denial of rehearing in november 2017 described above, in the fourth quarter 2017, entergy arkansas recorded an additional liability of $35 million and a regulatory asset of $31 million. in october
2018 the ferc issued an order addressing the alj's july 2017 initial decision. the ferc reversed the alj's decision to cap the reduction in entergy arkansas's payment to account for the increased bandwidth payments that entergy arkansas made to the other operating companies. the ferc also reversed the alj's decision that grand gulf sales from january through september 2000 should be included in the calculation of entergy arkansas's payment. the ferc affirmed on other grounds the alj's rejection of the lpsc's claim that certain joint account sales should be accounted for as part of the calculation of entergy arkansas's payment. in november 2018 the lpsc requested rehearing of the ferc's october 2018 decision. in december 2019 the ferc denied the lpsc's request for rehearing.
in december 2018, entergy made a compliance filing in response to the ferc's october 2018 order. the compliance filing provided a final calculation of entergy arkansas's payments to the other utility operating companies, including interest. no protests were filed in response to the december 2018 compliance filing. the december 2018
compliance filing is pending ferc action. refunds and interest in the following amounts were paid by entergy arkansas to the other operating companies in december 2018:
entergy arkansas previously recognized a regulatory asset with a balance of $116 million as of december 31, 2018
for a portion of the payments due as a result of this proceeding. 311 table of contents entergy arkansas, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis in february 2019 the lpsc filed a new complaint relating to two issues that were raised in the opportunity sales proceeding, but that, in its october 2018 order, the ferc held were outside the scope of the proceeding. in march 2019, entergy services filed an answer and motion to dismiss the new complaint. in november 2019 the ferc issued an order denying the lpsc's complaint. the order concluded that the settlement agreement approved by ferc in december 2015 terminating the system agreement barred the lpsc's new complaint. in may 2019, entergy arkansas filed an application and supporting testimony with the apsc requesting approval of a special rider tariff to recover the costs of these payments from its retail customers over a 24-month period. the application requested that the apsc approve the rider to take effect within 30 days or, if suspended by the apsc as allowed by commission rule, approve the rider to take effect in the first billing cycle of the first month occurring 30 days after issuance of the apsc's order approving the rider. in june 2019 the apsc suspended entergy arkansas's tariff and granted entergy arkansas's motion asking the apsc to establish the proceeding as the single designated proceeding in which interested parties may assert claims related to the appropriate retail rate treatment of the ferc's october 2018 order and related ferc orders in the opportunity sales proceeding. in january 2020 the apsc adopted a procedural schedule with a hearing in april 2020. in january 2020
the attorney general and arkansas electric energy consumers, inc. filed a joint motion seeking to dismiss entergy arkansas's application alleging that the apsc, in a prior proceeding, ruled on the issues addressed in the application and determined that entergy arkansas's requested relief violates the filed rate doctrine and the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking. entergy arkansas responded to the joint motion in february 2020
rebutting these arguments, including demonstrating that the claims in this proceeding differ substantially from those the apsc addressed previously and that the payment resulting from a ferc tariff violation for which entergy arkansas seeks retail cost recovery in this proceeding differs materially from the refunds resulting from a ferc tariff amendment that the apsc previously rejected on filed rate doctrine and the retroactive ratemaking grounds.
in addition, in january 2020 the attorney general and arkansas electric energy consumers, inc. filed testimony opposing the recovery by entergy arkansas of the opportunity sales payment but also claiming that certain components of the payment should be segregated and refunded to customers. net metering legislation an arkansas law was enacted effective july 2019 that, among other things, expands the definition of a "net metering customer" to include two additional types of customers: (1) customers that lease net metering facilities, subject to certain leasing arrangements, and (2) government entities or other entities exempt from state and federal income taxes that enter into a service contract for a net metering facility. the latter provision would allow eligible entities, many of whom are small and large general service customers, to purchase renewable energy directly from third party providers and receive bill credits for these purchases. the apsc was given authority under this law to address certain matters, such as cost shifting and the appropriate compensation for net metered energy, and has initiated proceedings for this purpose. because of the size and number of customers eligible under this new law, there is a risk of loss of load and the shifting of costs to customers. a hearing was held in december 2019, with utilities, cooperatives, the arkansas attorney general, industrial customers, and entergy arkansas advocating the need for establishment of a reasonable rate structure that takes into account impacts to non-net metering customers.
separately, as directed by the apsc general staff, the apsc opened a proceeding to compel utilities to amend their net metering tariffs to incorporate the provisions of the legislation that the apsc general staff considered "black letter law." entergy arkansas, the arkansas attorney general, and other intervenors opposed this directive pending the development of the rules for implementation that are being considered in the separate net metering rulemaking docket. nevertheless, reserving its rights, entergy arkansas has complied with the directive to amend its tariffs.
asserting procedural and due process violations, in january 2020, entergy arkansas and the arkansas attorney general separately appealed certain apsc orders in this proceeding. federal regulation see the " rate, cost-
recovery, and other regulation - federal regulation " section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis and note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of federal regulation.
312 table of contents entergy arkansas, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis nuclear matters entergy arkansas owns and, through an affiliate, operates the ano 1 and ano 2 nuclear power plants. entergy arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. these include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, to position entergy's nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues like stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems and the fukushima event; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license renewal and amendments, and decommissioning; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency of nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets and earnings to complete decommissioning of each site when required; and limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear plant operations and catastrophic events such as a nuclear accident. in the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ano 1 or ano 2, entergy arkansas may be required to file with the apsc a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. ano 1's operating license expires in 2034
and ano 2's operating license expires in 2038. environmental risks entergy arkansas's facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. management believes that entergy arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations, with reference to possible exceptions noted in " regulation of entergy's business -
environmental regulation " in part i, item 1. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. critical accounting estimates the preparation of entergy arkansas's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of entergy arkansas's financial position or results of operations. in the first quarter 2019, entergy arkansas recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liabilities for ano 1 and ano 2 as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study. the revised estimates resulted in a $126.2 million increase in its decommissioning cost liabilities, along with corresponding increases in the related asset retirement cost assets that will be depreciated over the remaining lives of the units. nuclear decommissioning costs see " nuclear decommissioning costs " in the " critical accounting estimates " section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. utility regulatory accounting see " utility regulatory accounting " in the " critical accounting estimates " section of entergy corporation 313 table of contents entergy arkansas, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of accounting for the effects of rate regulation. impairment of long-lived assets and trust fund investments see " impairment of long-lived assets and trust fund investments " in the " critical accounting estimates " section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the estimates associated with the impairment of long-lived assets and trust fund investments. taxation and uncertain tax positions see " taxation and uncertain tax positions " in the "

323 table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations 2019 compared to 2018 net income net income increased $15.9 million primarily due to higher retail electric price. the increase was partially offset by an income tax benefit recognized in 2018 as a result of the settlement of the 2012-2013 irs audit, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher other operation and maintenance expenses, lower volume/weather, and higher interest expense. operating revenues following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2019 to 2018:
2018 operating revenues                                  $4,296.3
return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred           102.5
income taxes to customers volume/weather                                              (28.4  )
2019 operating revenues                                  $4,285.2
entergy louisiana's results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. "fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income" includes the revenue variance associated with these items. the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan revenues effective september 2018 and an interim increase in formula rate plan revenues effective june 2019
due to the inclusion of the first-year revenue requirement for the st. charles power station, each as approved by the lpsc. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan proceedings. the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers resulted from the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through changes in the formula rate plan effective may 2018. in 2019,
$38.6 million was returned to customers as compared to $141.1 million in 2018. there was no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues was offset by a reduction in income tax expense. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the tax cuts and jobs act. the volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 673 gwh, or 3%, in billed electricity usage for residential and commercial customers, including the effect of less favorable weather. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in industrial usage primarily due to an increase in demand from expansion projects, primarily in the chemicals and transportation industries. 324 table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis other income statement variances other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:
•  a $14.8 million gain in 2018 from the sale of willow glen power station;
•  an increase of $12.7 million in information technology costs primarily due to higher costs related to applications and infrastructure support, enhanced cyber security, and upgrades and maintenance;
•  an increase of $12.4 million in spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services; and
•  an increase of $9.6 million in compensation and benefits costs primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation accruals in 2019 as compared to prior year.
the increase was partially offset by:
•  a decrease of $8.5 million in nuclear generation expenses primarily due to a lower scope of work performed during plant outages in 2019 as compared to 2018; and the effects of recording in 2019 the final judgment to resolve claims in the river bend damages case against
•  the doe related to spent nuclear fuel storage costs.  the damages awarded include the reimbursement of $5.2
million of spent nuclear fuel storage costs previously recorded as other operation and maintenance expense.
see note 8 to the financial statements for a discussion of the spent nuclear fuel litigation.
taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to increases in ad valorem taxes. ad valorem taxes increased primarily due to higher assessments. depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additions to plant in service, including the st. charles power station, which was placed into service in may 2019. other regulatory charges (credits) include regulatory charges of $73.1 million recorded in 2018 to reflect the effects of a provision in the settlement reached in the formula rate plan extension proceeding to return the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate in 2018 to customers. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the formula rate plan extension proceeding. interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $525 million of
the difference in the effective income tax rate of 15% versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and book and tax differences related to the non-taxable income distributions earned on preferred membership interests. the difference in the effective income tax rate of (8.8%) versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and an irs audit settlement for the 2012-2013 tax returns. see note 3

million , a decrease in legacy entergy gulf states louisiana formula rate plan revenue of $9.7 million , and a decrease in incremental formula rate plan revenue of $3.7 million . additionally, the formula rate plan evaluation report called for a decrease of $40.5 million in the miso cost recovery revenue requirement from $46.8 million to
$6.3 million . rates reflecting these adjustments were implemented with the first billing cycle of september 2017, subject to refund. in september 2017 the lpsc staff issued its report indicating that no changes to entergy louisiana's original formula rate plan evaluation report were required but reserved for several issues, including entergy louisiana's september 2017 update to its formula rate plan evaluation report. in july 2018, entergy louisiana and the lpsc staff filed an unopposed joint report setting forth a correction to the annualization calculation, the effect of which was a net $3.5 million revenue requirement reduction and indicating that there are no outstanding issues with the 2016 formula rate plan report, the supplemental report, or the interim updates. in september 2018 the lpsc approved the unopposed joint report. 332 table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis formula rate plan extension through 2019 test year in august 2017, entergy louisiana filed a request with the lpsc seeking to extend its formula rate plan for three years (2017-2019) with limited modifications to its terms. in april 2018, the lpsc approved an unopposed joint motion filed by entergy louisiana and the lpsc staff that settles the matter and extends the formula rate plan for three years, providing for rates through at least august 2021. in addition to retaining the major features of the traditional formula rate plan, some of the more substantive features of the extended formula rate plan include:
•  a mid-point reset of formula rate plan revenues to a 9.95% earned return on common equity for the 2017 test year and for the st. charles power station when it enters commercial operation;
•  narrowing of the common equity bandwidth to plus or minus 60 basis points around the earned return on common equity;
a cap on potential revenue increase of $35 million for the 2018 evaluation period, and $70 million for the
•  cumulative 2018 and 2019 evaluation periods, on formula rate plan cost of service rate increases (the cap excludes rate changes associated with the transmission recovery mechanism described below and rate changes associated with additional capacity);
•  a framework for the flow back of certain tax benefits created by the tax act to customers; and a transmission recovery mechanism providing for the opportunity to recover certain transmission related
•  expenditures in excess of $100 million for projects placed in service up to one month prior to rate change outside of sharing that is designed to operate in a fashion similar to the additional capacity mechanism.
entergy louisiana has indicated its intent to seek an extension of its formula rate plan on terms similar to the existing terms. 2017 formula rate plan filing in june 2018, entergy louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2017 calendar year operations. the 2017 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on equity of 8.16%, due in large part to revenue-neutral realignments to other recovery mechanisms. without these realignments, the evaluation report produces an earned return on equity of 9.88% and a resulting base rider formula rate plan revenue increase of $4.8 million. excluding the tax act credits provided for by the tax reform adjustment mechanisms, total formula rate plan revenues were further increased by a total of $98 million as a result of the evaluation report due to adjustments to the additional capacity and miso cost recovery mechanisms of the formula rate plan, and implementation of the transmission recovery mechanism. in august 2018, entergy louisiana filed a supplemental formula rate plan evaluation report to reflect changes from the 2016 test year formula rate plan proceedings, a decrease to the transmission recovery mechanism to reflect lower actual capital additions, and a decrease to evaluation period expenses to reflect the terms of a new power sales agreement. based on the august
2018 update, entergy louisiana recognized a total decrease in formula rate plan revenue of approximately $17.6
million. results of the updated 2017 evaluation report filing were implemented with the september 2018 billing month subject to refund and review by the lpsc staff and intervenors. in accordance with the terms of the formula rate plan, in september 2018 the lpsc staff and intervenors submitted their responses to entergy louisiana's original formula rate plan evaluation report and supplemental compliance updates. the lpsc staff asserted objections/reservations regarding 1) entergy louisiana's proposed rate adjustments associated with the return of excess accumulated deferred income taxes pursuant to the tax act and the treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes related to reductions of rate base; 2) entergy louisiana's reservation regarding treatment of a regulatory asset related to certain special orders by the lpsc; and 3) test year expenses billed from entergy services to entergy louisiana. intervenors also objected to entergy louisiana's treatment of the regulatory asset related to certain special orders by the lpsc. a procedural schedule has not yet been established to resolve these issues. 333

charles power station commenced in may 2019. in may 2019, entergy louisiana filed an update to its 2017 formula rate plan evaluation report to include the estimated first-year revenue requirement of $109.5 million associated with the st. charles power station. the resulting interim adjustment to rates became effective with the first billing cycle of june 2019. 2018 formula rate plan filing in may 2019, entergy louisiana filed its formula rate plan evaluation report for its 2018 calendar year operations. the 2018 test year evaluation report produced an earned return on common equity of 10.61% leading to a base rider formula rate plan revenue decrease of $8.9
million. while base rider formula rate plan revenue will decrease as a result of this filing, overall formula rate plan revenues will increase by approximately $118.7 million. this outcome is primarily driven by a reduction to the credits previously flowed through the tax reform adjustment mechanism and an increase in the transmission recovery mechanism, partially offset by reductions in the additional capacity mechanism revenue requirements and extraordinary cost items. the filing is subject to review by the lpsc. resulting rates were implemented in september 2019, subject to refund. entergy louisiana also included in its filing a presentation of an initial proposal to combine the legacy entergy louisiana and legacy entergy gulf states louisiana residential rates, which combination, if approved, would be accomplished on a revenue-neutral basis intended not to affect the rates of other customer classes. entergy louisiana contemplates that any combination of residential rates resulting from this request would be implemented with the results of the 2019 test year formula rate plan filing. several parties intervened in the proceeding and the lpsc staff filed its report of objections/reservations in accordance with the applicable provisions of the formula rate plan. in its report the lpsc staff re-urged reservations with respect to the outstanding issues from the 2017 test year formula rate plan filing and disputed the inclusion of certain affiliate costs for test years 2017 and 2018. the lpsc staff objected to entergy louisiana's proposal to combine residential rates but proposed the setting of a status conference to establish a procedural schedule to more fully address the issue. the lpsc staff also reserved its right to object to the treatment of the sale of willow glen reflected in the evaluation report and to the august 2019 compliance update, which was made primarily to update the capital additions reflected in the formula rate plan's transmission recovery mechanism, based on limited time to review it. additionally, since the completion of certain transmission projects, the lpsc staff has issued supplemental data requests addressing the prudence of entergy louisiana's expenditures in connection with those projects. entergy louisiana is in the process of responding to those requests. investigation of costs billed by entergy services in november 2018 the lpsc issued a notice of proceeding initiating an investigation into costs incurred by entergy services that are included in the retail rates of entergy louisiana. as stated in the notice of proceeding, the lpsc observed an increase in capital construction-related costs incurred by entergy services.
discovery was issued and included efforts to seek highly detailed information on a broad range of matters unrelated to the scope of the audit. there has been no further activity in the investigation since may 2019. waterford 3
replacement steam generator project following the completion of the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, the lpsc undertook a prudence review in connection with a filing made by entergy louisiana in april 2013
with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3)
success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs. in july 2014 the lpsc 334 table of contents entergy louisiana, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis staff filed testimony recommending potential project and replacement power cost disallowances of up to $71 million , citing a need for further explanation or documentation from entergy louisiana. an intervenor filed testimony recommending disallowance of $141 million of incremental project costs, claiming the steam generator fabricator was imprudent. entergy louisiana provided further documentation and explanation requested by the lpsc staff. an evidentiary hearing was held in december 2014. entergy louisiana believed that the replacement steam generator costs were prudently incurred and applicable legal principles supported their recovery in rates. nevertheless, entergy louisiana recorded a write-off of $16 million of waterford
3's plant balance in december 2014 because of the uncertainty at the time associated with the resolution of the prudence review. in december 2015 the alj issued a proposed recommendation, which was subsequently finalized, concluding that entergy louisiana prudently managed the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project, including the selection, use, and oversight of contractors, and could not reasonably have anticipated the damage to the steam generators. nevertheless, the alj concluded that entergy louisiana was liable for the conduct of its contractor and subcontractor and, therefore, recommended a disallowance of $67 million in capital costs. additionally, the alj concluded that entergy louisiana did not sufficiently justify the incurrence of $2 million in replacement power costs during the replacement outage. although the alj's recommendation had not yet been considered by the lpsc, after considering the progress of the proceeding in light of the alj recommendation, entergy louisiana recorded in the fourth quarter 2015 approximately $77 million in charges, including a $45 million asset write-off and a $32
million regulatory charge, to reflect that a portion of the assets associated with the waterford 3 replacement steam generator project was no longer probable of recovery. entergy louisiana maintained that the alj's recommendation contained significant factual and legal errors. in october 2016 the parties reached a settlement in this matter. the settlement was approved by the lpsc in december 2016. the settlement effectively provided for an agreed-upon disallowance of $67 million of plant, which had been previously written off by entergy louisiana, as discussed above. the refund to customers of approximately $71 million as a result of the settlement approved by the lpsc was made to customers in january 2017. of the $71 million of refunds, $68 million was credited to customers through entergy louisiana's formula rate plan, outside of sharing, and $3 million through its fuel adjustment clause. entergy louisiana had previously recorded a provision of $48 million for this refund. the previously-
recorded provision included the cumulative revenues recorded through december 2016 related to the $67 million of disallowed plant. an additional regulatory charge of $23 million was recorded in fourth quarter 2016 to reflect the effects of the settlement. the settlement also provided that entergy louisiana could retain the value associated with potential service credits agreed to by the project contractor, to the extent they are realized in the future.
following a review by the parties, an unopposed joint report of proceedings was filed by the lpsc staff and entergy louisiana in may 2017 and the lpsc accepted the joint report of proceedings resolving the matter. advanced metering infrastructure (ami) in november 2016, entergy louisiana filed an application seeking a finding from the lpsc that entergy louisiana's deployment of advanced electric and gas metering infrastructure is in the public interest.
entergy louisiana proposed to deploy advanced meters that enable two-way data communication; design and build a secure and reliable network to support such communications; and implement support systems. ami is intended to serve as the foundation of entergy louisiana's modernized power grid. the filing included an estimate of implementation costs for ami of $330 million and identified a number of quantified and unquantified benefits. entergy louisiana proposed a 15-year useful life for the new advanced meters, the three-year deployment of which began in 2019.

2019 compared to 2018 net income net income decreased $6.2 million primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expenses, lower volume/weather, and a higher effective income tax rate, partially offset by higher retail electric price. operating revenues following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing

2019 operating revenues                                  $1,323.0
entergy mississippi's results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. "fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income" includes the revenue variance associated with these items. the volume/weather variance is primarily due to a decrease of 455 gwh, or 3%, in billed electricity usage, including the effect of less favorable weather on residential sales and a decrease in industrial usage. the decrease in industrial usage is primarily due to decreased small industrial sales. the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers is due to the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through customer bill credits over a three-month period from july 2018 through september 2018 per an agreement approved by the mpsc in june 2018 resulting from the stipulation related to the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act. there was no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues was offset by a reduction in income tax expense. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the tax cuts and jobs act. the retail electric price variance is primarily due to an increase in formula rate plan rates effective with the first billing cycle of july 2019 and an accrual in the fourth quarter 2019 for the interim capacity rate adjustment to the formula rate plan to recover non-fuel related costs associated with the acquisition of the choctaw generating station, each as approved by the mpsc. entergy mississippi began billing the interim capacity rate adjustment in january 2020. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan filing and the interim capacity rate adjustment. 350
table of contents entergy mississippi, llc management's financial discussion and analysis other income statement variances other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:
•  an increase of $4.7 millionin spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services; and
•  an increase of $4.6 million in information technology costs primarily due to higher costs related to applications and infrastructure support, enhanced cyber security, and upgrades and maintenance.
the increase was partially offset by a $5.8 million loss in 2018 on the sale of fuel oil inventory per an agreement approved by the mpsc in june 2018 resulting from the stipulation related to the effects of the tax act. there is no effect on net income as the loss on the sale of fuel oil inventory is offset by a reduction in income tax expense.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily as a result of higher depreciation rates, as approved by the mpsc, and additions to plant in service. other regulatory charges include a regulatory charge recorded in second quarter 2018 to reflect the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes per an agreement approved by the mpsc in june 2018 that resulted in a reduction in net utility plant of $127.2 million. there was no effect on net income as the regulatory charge was offset by a reduction in income tax expense. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity related to the tax cuts and jobs act. interest expense increased primarily due to issuances of $300 million in june 2019 and $135 million in november 2019, of
3.85% series mortgage bonds and the issuance of $55 million of 4.52% series mortgage bonds in december 2018, partially offset by the repayment, at maturity, of $150 million of 6.64% series mortgage bonds in july 2019. see note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt. the effective income tax rates were 20.5% for
2019 and (41,237%) for 2018. the difference in the effective income tax rate of (41,237%) versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 was primarily due to the flow through of excess accumulated deferred income taxes.
see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates. 2018 compared to 2017 see " management's financial discussion and analysis - results of operations " in entergy mississippi's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 for discussion of results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017. income tax legislation see the " income tax legislation " section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the tax cuts and jobs act, the federal income tax legislation enacted in december 2017. note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the act on 2017, 2018, and 2019 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the act, and note 2 to the financial statements discusses the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the act. 351 table of contents entergy mississippi, llc management's financial discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 were as follows:

2019 compared to 2018 operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $78.4 million in 2019 primarily due to:
•  the timing of collection of receivables from customers;
the receipt of $36.2 million from entergy arkansas as a result of a compliance filing made in response to
•  the ferc's october 2018 order in the entergy arkansas opportunity sales proceeding.  see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding; and
•  $26.2 million in proceeds from the sale of fuel oil inventory in 2018.
the decrease was partially offset by the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs and the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers in 2018. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the tax cuts and jobs act. investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities increased $314.2 million in 2019 primarily due to:
•  the purchase of the choctaw generating station in october 2019 for approximately $305 million.  see note 14
to the financial statements for further discussion of the choctaw generating station purchase;
•  an increase of $34.9 million primarily due to investment in the infrastructure of entergy mississippi's distribution system, including increased spending on advanced metering infrastructure; and
•  an increase of $15.6 million in storm spending in 2019.
the increase was partially offset by money pool activity. increases in entergy mississippi's receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and entergy mississippi's receivable from the money pool increased by $3.3
million in 2019 compared to increasing by $39.7 million in 2018. the money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings. 352 table of contents entergy mississippi, llc management's financial discussion and analysis financing activities net cash flow provided by financing activities increased $376.5 million in 2019 primarily due to:
•  the issuance of $435 million of 3.85% series mortgage bonds in 2019 compared to the issuance of $55 million of 4.52% series mortgage bonds 2018;
•  a capital contribution of $130 million in october 2019 in anticipation of  the purchase of the choctaw generating station in october 2019; and the redemption of $20 million of preferred stock in 2018 in connection with the internal restructuring.  see
•  note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the internal restructuring and note 6 to the financial statements for details of preferred stock activity.
the increase was partially offset by the repayment, at maturity, of $150 million of 6.64% series mortgage bonds in july 2019. see note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt. 2018 compared to 2017 see "
management's financial discussion and analysis - liquidity and capital resources - cash flow " in entergy mississippi's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2018 compared to 2017. capital structure entergy mississippi's debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table.

net debt to net capital     50.4  %                   49.9  %
net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings, finance lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt and equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. entergy mississippi uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy mississippi's financial condition. entergy mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy mississippi's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy mississippi's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. entergy mississippi seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy mississippi may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure. in addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, entergy mississippi may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure. 353 table of contents entergy mississippi, llc management's financial discussion and analysis uses of capital entergy mississippi requires capital resources for:

369 table of contents entergy new orleans, llc and subsidiaries management ' s financial discussion and analysis results of operations 2019 compared to 2018 net income net income decreased $0.5 million primarily due to lower retail electric price and a higher effective income tax rate, substantially offset by higher other income and lower other operation and maintenance expenses. operating revenues following is an analysis of the change in operating revenues comparing 2019 to 2018.
2018 operating revenues                                    $717.4

income taxes to customers
2019 operating revenues                                    $686.2
entergy new orleans's results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. "fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income" includes the revenue variance associated with these items. the retail electric price variance is primarily due to a provision for rate refund recorded in fourth quarter 2019 as a result of the 2018 combined rate case resolution approved by the city council.
see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case resolution. the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in usage during the unbilled sales period. the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers variance is due to a decrease in the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through the fuel adjustment clause. in 2019, $2.1 million was returned to customers as compared to $12 million in 2018. there is no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues in each period is offset by a reduction in income tax expense. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of regulatory activity regarding the tax cuts and jobs act. other income statement variances other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:
a decrease of $9.2 million as a result of the deferral in 2019 of 2018 costs related to the rate case and a

370 table of contents entergy new orleans, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis council. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case resolution; and
•  a decrease of $2.9 million in distribution expenses primarily due to lower contract labor costs.
the decrease was partially offset by:
•  an increase of $2.9 million in spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services;
•  an increase of $2.8 million in information technology costs primarily due to higher software maintenance costs and higher contract costs;
•  an increase of $2 million in customer service costs primarily due to higher labor costs, including contract labor; and
•  an increase of $1.8 million in energy efficiency costs.
•  an increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction resulting from higher construction work in progress in 2019, including the new orleans power station project; and the accrual in fourth quarter 2018 of a $5 million settlement offer in the new orleans power station show
•  cause proceeding.  see "liquidity and capital resources- uses of capital-new orleans power station" below for discussion of the new orleans power station proceedings.
the effective income tax rates were 0.4% for 2019 and (4.8%) for 2018. the differences in the effective income tax rates versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates. 2018 compared to 2017 see " management's financial discussion and analysis - results of operations " in entergy new orleans's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 for discussion of results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017. income tax legislation see the " income tax legislation " section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the tax cuts and jobs act, the federal income tax legislation enacted in december 2017. note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the act on 2017,
2018, and 2019 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the act, and note 2 to the financial statements discusses the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the act. 371 table of contents entergy new orleans, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:

2019 compared to 2018 operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $56.2 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease of $34.5 million in 2019 of income tax refunds and the timing of collection of receivables from customers. entergy new orleans had income tax refunds in 2019 and 2018 in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement. the income tax refunds resulted from the utilization of entergy new orleans's net operating loss. investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $3.3
million in 2019 primarily due to money pool activity. the decrease was substantially offset by:
an increase of $15.6 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of
•  work performed in 2019 as compared to 2018, including investment in entergy new orleans's system reliability and infrastructure; and an increase of $10.7 million in distribution construction expenditures primarily due to investment in the
•  reliability and infrastructure of entergy new orleans's distribution system, including increased spending on advanced metering infrastructure.
decreases in entergy new orleans's receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and entergy new orleans's receivable from the money pool decreased by $16.8 million in 2019 compared to increasing by $9.3 million in 2018. the money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings. financing activities net cash flow provided by financing activities increased

the increase was partially offset by the issuance of $60 million of 4.51% series mortgage bonds in september 2018.

capital consists of debt and equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. entergy new orleans uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy new orleans's financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to entergy new orleans, as more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements. entergy new orleans also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy new orleans's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy new orleans's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. entergy new orleans seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a distribution, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy new orleans may issue incremental debt or reduce distributions, or both, to maintain its capital structure. in addition, in certain infrequent circumstances, such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reducing distributions, entergy new orleans may receive equity contributions to maintain its capital structure. 373 table of contents entergy new orleans, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis uses of capital entergy new orleans requires capital resources for:

the city council adopted a resolution approving construction of the new orleans power station, a 128 mw unit composed of natural gas-fired reciprocating engines, and a related cost recovery plan. the cost estimate for the plant, which will be located at the site of the michoud generating facility that was retired in may 2016, is $210
several intervenors filed testimony opposing the construction of the new orleans power station on various grounds.
in july 2017, entergy new orleans submitted a supplemental and amending application to the city council seeking approval to construct either the originally proposed 226 mw advanced combustion turbine power station, or alternatively, the 128 mw power station. in addition, the application renewed the commitment to pursue up to 100 mw of renewable resources to serve new orleans. in april 2018 intervenors opposing the construction of the new orleans power station filed with the city council a request for rehearing, which was subsequently denied, and a petition for judicial review of the city council's decision, and also filed a lawsuit challenging the city council's approval based on louisiana's open meeting law. in may 2018 the city council announced that it would initiate an investigation into allegations that entergy new orleans, entergy, or some other entity paid or participated in paying certain attendees and speakers in support of the new orleans power station to attend or speak at certain meetings organized by the city council. in october 2018 investigators for the city council released their report, concluding that individuals were paid to attend or speak in support of the new orleans power station and that entergy new orleans "knew or should have known that such conduct occurred or reasonably might occur." the city council issued a resolution requiring entergy new orleans to show cause why it should not be fined $5 million as a result of the findings in the report. in november 2018, entergy new orleans submitted its response to the show cause resolution, disagreeing with certain characterizations and omissions of fact in the report and asserting that the city council could not legally impose the proposed fine. simultaneous with the filing of its response to the show cause resolution, entergy new orleans sent a letter to the city council re-asserting that the city council's imposition of the proposed fine would be unlawful, but acknowledging that the actions of a subcontractor, which was retained by an entergy new orleans contractor without the knowledge or contractually-required consent of entergy new orleans, were contrary to entergy's values. in that letter, entergy new orleans offered to donate $5 million to the city council to resolve the show cause proceeding. in january 2019, entergy new orleans submitted a new settlement proposal to the city council. the proposal retains the components of the first offer but adds to it a commitment to make reasonable efforts to limit the costs of the project to the $210 million cost estimate with advanced notification of anticipated cost overruns, additional reporting requirements for cost and environmental items, and a commitment regarding reliability investment and to work with the new orleans sewerage and water board to provide a reliable source of power. in february 2019 the city council approved a resolution approving the settlement proposal and allowing the construction of the new orleans power station to commence. also in february
2019 certain intervenors in the city council proceeding on the new orleans power station filed suit in louisiana state court challenging the louisiana department of environmental quality's issuance of the new orleans power station's air permit. entergy new orleans intervened in that lawsuit and, along with the louisiana 375 table of contents entergy new orleans, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis department of environmental quality, filed exceptions seeking dismissal of the lawsuit. in june 2019 the state court judge sustained the exceptions and dismissed the plaintiffs' petition with prejudice. also in june 2019, a state court judge in new orleans affirmed the city council's approval of the new orleans power station and dismissed the petition for judicial review that had been filed in april 2018. the petitioners have filed an appeal of that ruling. also in june 2019, with regard to the lawsuit challenging the city council's decision on the basis of a violation of the open meetings law, the same state court judge in new orleans ruled that there was a violation of the open meetings law at the february 2018 meeting of the city council's utility committee at which that committee considered the new orleans power station approval, and further ruled that, although there was no violation of the open meetings law at the march 2018 full city council meeting at which the new orleans power station was approved, both the approval of the utility committee and the approval of the full city council were void. the city council and entergy new orleans each filed a suspensive appeal of the open meetings law ruling. a suspensive appeal suspends the effect of the judgment in the open meetings law proceeding while the appeal is being taken. the petitioners sought in the state appellate court, and then at the louisiana supreme court, to terminate the suspension of the effect of the judgment, but both courts declined to do so. appellate briefing on the merits both in the open meetings law appeal and in the judicial review appeal occurred in november and december 2019 and oral argument in both cases was heard in january 2020. in february 2020 the state appellate court reversed the lower court's ruling that the city council's approval of the new orleans power station was void due to a violation of the open meetings law at the city council's utility committee meeting in february 2018. the state appellate court ruled that there was no violation of the open meetings law at the full city council meeting in march 2018 and that the lower court erred in voiding the city council resolution approving the new orleans power station. the appellate court's decision on the appeal of the judicial review decision that affirmed the city council's approval of the new orleans power station as in the public interest is still pending. construction of the plant is on schedule, with commercial operation expected in mid-2020. gas infrastructure rebuild plan in september 2016, entergy new orleans submitted to the city council a request for authorization for entergy new orleans to proceed with annual incremental capital funding of $12.5 million for its gas infrastructure rebuild plan, which would replace all of entergy new orleans's low pressure cast iron, steel, and vintage plastic pipe over a ten-year period commencing in
2017. entergy new orleans also proposed that recovery of the investment to fund its gas infrastructure replacement plan be determined in connection with its next base rate case. the city council authorized entergy new orleans to proceed with its replacement plans and established a schedule for proceedings in advance of the rate case intended to provide an opportunity for evaluation of the gas infrastructure plan that would best serve the public interest and the effect on customers of the approval of any such plan. in the course of that proceeding, the city council's advisors submitted pre-filed testimony recommending that entergy new orleans be allowed to continue with its condition-based approach to gas pipeline replacement to replace approximately 238 miles of low pressure pipe at a rate of approximately 25 miles per year. the city council's advisors also recommended that entergy new orleans be required to adhere to certain reporting requirements and recognized the need to address the sustained level of investment in gas infrastructure on customer bills. in september 2017, entergy new orleans filed rebuttal testimony suggesting that its recovery of future investment and customer effects would be addressed in the rate case that entergy new orleans was required to file in july 2018. the procedural schedule was suspended in order to allow for resolution in the rate case proceeding. as a result of the rate case, the city council approved the planned gas rebuild expenditures through 2019, but rejected entergy new orleans's proposed gas infrastructure rider. entergy new orleans is required to submit a gas infrastructure rebuild plan to the city council in march 2020 and to convene a working group to explore appropriate cost mitigation measures. renewables in july 2018, entergy new orleans filed an application with the city council requesting approval of three utility-scale solar projects totaling 90 mw. if approved, the resource additions will allow entergy new orleans to make significant progress towards meeting its voluntary commitment to the city council to add up to 100 mw of renewable energy resources. the three projects include constructing a self-build solar plant in orleans parish with an 376 table of contents entergy new orleans, llc and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis output of 20 mw, acquiring a 50 mw solar facility in washington parish through a build-own-transfer acquisition, and procuring 20 mw of solar power from a project to be built in st. james parish through a power purchase agreement. in december 2018 the city council advisors requested that entergy new orleans pursue alternative deal structures for the washington parish project and attempt to reduce costs for the 20 mw new orleans solar station. as a result of settlement discussions, in march 2019, entergy new orleans revised its application to convert the build-own transfer acquisition of the 50
mw facility in washington parish to a power purchase agreement. in june 2019 the parties to the proceeding executed a stipulated settlement term sheet, which recommends that the city council approve entergy new orleans's revised application as to all three projects. in july 2019 the city council approved the stipulated settlement. sources of capital entergy new orleans's sources to meet its capital requirements include:
•  internally generated funds;
•  capital contributions; and

providing for the transfer from entergy louisiana to entergy new orleans of certain assets that supported the provision of service to entergy louisiana's customers in algiers, it was agreed that, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to entergy new orleans's base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018. this provision eliminated the formula rate plan applicable to algiers operations. the limited exceptions included continued implementation of the then-
remaining two years of the four-year phased-in rate increase for the algiers area and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in the base revenue requirement. an additional provision of the settlement agreement allowed for continued recovery of the revenue requirement associated with the capacity and energy from ninemile 6 received by entergy new orleans under a power purchase agreement with entergy louisiana (algiers ppa). the settlement authorized entergy new orleans to recover the remaining revenue requirement related to the algiers ppa through base rates charged to algiers customers. the settlement also provided for continued implementation of the algiers miso recovery rider. a 2008 rate case settlement included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the energy smart energy efficiency programs. the rate settlement provided an incentive for entergy new orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the city council and provided a mechanism for entergy new orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs.
using the remainder of the approximately $12.8 million of 2014 rough production cost equalization funds, with any remaining costs being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. this funding methodology was modified in november 2015 when the city council directed entergy new orleans to use a combination of guaranteed customer savings related to a prior agreement with the city council and rough production cost equalization funds to cover program costs prior to recovering any costs through the fuel adjustment clause. in april 2017 the city council approved an implementation plan for the energy smart program from april 2017 through december 2019. the city council directed that the $11.8 million balance reported for energy smart funds be used to continue funding the program for entergy new orleans's legacy customers and that the energy smart algiers program continue to be funded through the algiers fuel adjustment clause, until additional customer funding is required for the legacy customers.
in september 2017, entergy new orleans filed a supplemental plan and proposed several options for an interim cost recovery mechanism necessary to recover program costs during the period between when existing funds directed to energy smart programs are depleted and when new rates from the 2018 combined rate case, which includes a cost recovery mechanism for energy smart funding, take effect. in december 2017 the city council approved an energy efficiency cost recovery rider as an interim funding mechanism for energy smart, subject to verification that no additional funding sources exist. in june 2018 the city council also approved a resolution recommending that entergy new orleans allocate approximately $13.5 million of benefits resulting from the tax act to energy smart. in december 2019, entergy new orleans filed an application with the city council seeking approval of an implementation plan for the energy smart program from april 2020 through december 2022. entergy new orleans proposed to recover the costs of the program through mechanisms previously approved by the city council or through the energy efficiency cost recovery rider, which was approved in the 2018 combined rate case resolution. in january 2020 the city council's advisors recommended that the city council allow entergy new orleans to earn a utility performance incentive of 7% of energy smart costs for each year in which entergy new orleans achieves 100% of the city council's savings targets for energy smart. the city council is expected to decide on the matter in february 2020.

391 table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis results of operations 2019 compared to 2018 net income net income decreased $2.8 million primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate, after excluding the effect of the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes which is offset in operating revenues, higher depreciation and amortization expenses and higher other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher retail electric price and higher other income.
operating revenues following is an analysis of the change in operating revenue comparing 2019 to 2018.

2019 operating revenues                                  $1,489.0
entergy texas's results include revenues from rate mechanisms designed to recover fuel, purchased power, and other costs such that the revenues and expenses associated with these items generally offset and do not affect net income. "fuel, rider, and other revenues that do not significantly affect net income" includes the revenue variance associated with these items. the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers resulted from the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes through a rider effective october
2018. in 2019, $87.4 million was returned to customers as compared to $14.6 million in 2018. there is no effect on net income as the reduction in operating revenues is offset by a reduction in income tax expense. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of regulatory activity regarding the tax cuts and jobs act. the retail electric price variance is primarily due to a base rate increase effective october 2018 as approved by the puct.
see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case. the volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in usage during the unbilled sales period. other income statement variances other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to:
•  an increase of $5.1 million in information technology costs primarily due to higher costs related to applications
392 table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis and infrastructure support, enhanced cyber security, and upgrades and maintenance;
•  an increase of $4.7 million in spending on initiatives to explore new customer products and services;
•  an increase of $3.9 million in fossil-fueled generation expenses primarily due to a higher scope of work performed during plant outages in 2019 as compared to 2018; and
•  an increase of $3.4 million in distribution operations and asset management costs primarily due to higher contract costs for meter reading services and higher advanced metering customer education costs.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily as a result of new depreciation rates established in the settlement of the 2018 base rate case and additions to plant in service. other regulatory charges (credits) include regulatory charges of $25.4 million recorded in 2018 to reflect the effects of a provision in the settlement reached in the 2018 rate case proceeding to return the benefits of the lower federal income tax rate in 2018 to customers. see note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the rate case proceeding. other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2019, including the montgomery county power station project. interest expense decreased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due to higher construction work in progress in 2019, including the montgomery county power station project. the effective income tax rates were (51.1%) for 2019 and (19.3%) for 2018. the difference in the effective income tax rate of (51.1%)
versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and book and tax differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during construction. the difference in the effective income tax rate of (19.3%) versus the federal statutory rate of 21%
for 2018 was primarily due to the flow through and amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes, along with the effect on income tax expense of the resolution of entergy texas's 2018 base rate proceeding. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates. 2018 compared to 2017 see " management's financial discussion and analysis - results of operations " in entergy texas's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 for discussion of results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017. income tax legislation see the " income tax legislation " section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the tax cuts and jobs act, the federal income tax legislation enacted in december 2017. note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the act on 2017, 2018, and 2019 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the act, and note 2 to the financial statements discusses the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the act. 393

2019 primarily due to the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers and the receipt of $33.2 million in 2018 from entergy arkansas as a result of a compliance filing made in response to the ferc's october 2018 order in the entergy arkansas opportunity sales proceeding. the decrease was partially offset by the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs and the timing of collection of receivables from customers. see note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the opportunity sales proceeding and regulatory activity regarding the tax cuts and jobs act. investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities increased $482.3 million in 2019 primarily due to:
•  an increase of $243.3 million in fossil-fueled generation construction expenditures primarily due to increased spending on the montgomery county power station;
•  an increase of $153.4 million in transmission construction expenditures primarily due to a higher scope of work performed in 2019 as compared to 2018;

•  the issuance of $35 million aggregate liquidation value 5.375% series a preferred stock in september 2019.
the increase was partially offset by the repayment, at maturity, of $500 million of 7.125% series mortgage bonds in february 2019 and money pool activity. see note 5 to the financial statements for more details on long-term debt.
see note 6 to the financial statements for more details on the issuance of preferred stock. decreases in entergy texas's payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and entergy texas's payable to the money pool decreased by $22.4 million in 2019 compared to increasing by $22.4 million in 2018. 2018 compared to 2017 see " management's financial discussion and analysis - liquidity and capital resources - cash flow " in entergy texas's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2018 compared to 2017. capital structure entergy texas's debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. the increase in the debt to capital ratio for entergy texas is primarily due to the net issuance of $500 million of mortgage bonds in 2019, partially offset by an increase in equity.

net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt and equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. entergy texas uses the debt to capital ratios excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes they provide useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy texas's financial condition because the securitization bonds are non-recourse to entergy texas, as more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements. entergy texas also uses the net debt to net capital ratio excluding securitization bonds in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating entergy texas's financial condition because net debt indicates entergy texas's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. entergy texas seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure.
to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, entergy texas may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its capital structure. in addition, entergy texas may receive equity 395 table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis contributions to maintain its capital structure for certain circumstances such as large transactions that would materially alter the capital structure if financed entirely with debt and reduced dividends. uses of capital entergy texas requires capital resources for:

2006-2008 production costs. in june 2016, entergy texas filed an unopposed settlement agreement that added additional over-recovered fuel costs for the months of march and april 2016. the settlement resulted in a $68
million refund. the alj approved the refund on an interim basis and it was made to most customers over a four-month period beginning with the first billing cycle of july 2016. in july 2016 the puct issued an order approving the interim refund. the federal appeal of the puct's january 2016 decision was heard in december 2016, and the federal district court granted entergy texas's requested relief. in january 2017 the puct and an intervenor filed petitions for appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit of the federal district court ruling. oral argument was held before the fifth circuit in february 2018. in april 2018 the fifth circuit reversed the decision of the federal district court, reinstating the original puct decision. in october 2018, entergy texas filed a notice of nonsuit in its appeal to the travis county district court regarding the puct's january 2016 decision. 400 table of contents entergy texas, inc. and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis in july 2016, entergy texas filed an application to reconcile its fuel and purchased power costs for the period april 1, 2013 through march 31, 2016. during the reconciliation period, entergy texas incurred approximately $1.77 billion in texas jurisdictional eligible fuel and purchased power expenses, net of certain revenues credited to such expenses and other adjustments. entergy texas estimated an over-recovery balance of approximately $19.3 million , including interest, which entergy texas requested authority to carry over as the beginning balance for the subsequent reconciliation period beginning april 2016. entergy texas also noted, however, that the estimated $19.3 million over collection was being refunded to customers as a portion of the interim fuel refund beginning with the first billing cycle of july 2016, discussed above. entergy texas also requested a prudence finding for each of the fuel-
related contracts and arrangements entered into or modified during the reconciliation period that have not been reviewed by the puct in a prior proceeding. in december 2016, entergy texas entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement resulting in a $6 million disallowance not associated with any particular issue raised and a refund of the over-recovery balance of $21 million as of november 30, 2016, to most customers beginning april 2017

million primarily due to the increase in operating revenues resulting from changes in rate base, as compared to prior year, and a lower effective income tax rate, after excluding the effect of the return of unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes to customers which is offset in income taxes. income taxes the effective income tax rates were 13.4% for 2019 and (102.7%) for 2018. the difference in the effective income tax rate of 13.4%
versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2019 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and certain book and tax differences related to utility plant items, partially offset by state income taxes. the difference in the effective income tax rate of (102.7%) versus the federal statutory rate of 21% for 2018 was primarily due to the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes. see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 21% to the effective income tax rates. 2018 compared to 2017 see " management's financial discussion and analysis - results of operations " in system energy's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 for discussion of results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017. income tax legislation see the " income tax legislation " section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the tax cuts and jobs act, the federal income tax legislation enacted in december 2017. note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the tax act on 2017, 2018, and 2019 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the tax act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the tax act, and note

2019 compared to 2018 operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $198.8 million in 2019 primarily due to:
•  the decrease in the return of the unprotected excess accumulated deferred income taxes in 2018;
•  a decrease in spending of $48.5 million on nuclear refueling outages in 2019 as compared to prior year; and
•  a decrease of $51.7 million in income taxes paid in 2019.  system energy made income tax payments of $54
million in 2018 in accordance with an intercompany income tax allocation agreement.
a decrease of $102.7 million as a result of fluctuations in nuclear fuel activity because of variations from
•  year to year in the timing and pricing of fuel reload requirements in the utility business, material and services deliveries, and the timing of cash payments during the nuclear fuel cycle;
•  a decrease of $28.4 million in nuclear construction expenditures as a result of spending in 2018 on grand gulf outage projects.
decreases in system energy's receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow and system energy's receivable from the money pool decreased by $47.8 million in 2019 compared to decreasing by $4.5 million in 2018.
the money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the utility subsidiaries' need for external short-term borrowings. financing activities net cash flow used in financing activities increased $201.1

413 table of contents system energy resources, inc. management's financial discussion and analysis an increase of $56.5 million in common stock dividends and distributions in 2019.  common stock dividends
•  and distributions were lower in 2018 in anticipation of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes being returned to customers as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act; and
•  net repayments of $82.3 million of long-term borrowings in 2019 compared to net borrowings of $63.9 million of long-term borrowings in 2018 on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity's credit facility.
the increase was partially offset by:
•  the payment in october 2018, at maturity, of $85 million of the system energy nuclear fuel company variable interest entity's 3.78% series i notes; and
•  net repayments of short-term borrowings of $17.8 million in 2018 on the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity's credit facility.
in march 2019, system energy issued $134 million of 2.50% series 2019 revenue refunding bonds due april 2022. the proceeds were used to redeem, prior to maturity, $134 million of 5.875% series 1998 pollution control revenue refunding bonds due april 2022. see note 5 to the financial statements for additional details of long-term debt.
2018 compared to 2017 see " management's financial discussion and analysis - liquidity and capital resources - cash flow " in system energy's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 for discussion of operating, investing, and financing cash flow activities for 2018 compared to 2017. capital structure system energy's debt to capital ratio is shown in the following table. the decrease in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to a decrease in long-term debt outstanding, partially offset by a decrease in retained earnings.
debt to capital             43.5  %                   46.1  %

net debt to net capital     40.2  %                   42.1  %
net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. debt consists of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. capital consists of debt and common equity. net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. system energy uses the debt to capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating system energy's financial condition. system energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating system energy's financial condition because net debt indicates system energy's outstanding debt position that could not be readily satisfied by cash and cash equivalents on hand. system energy seeks to optimize its capital structure in accordance with its regulatory requirements and to control its cost of capital while also maintaining equity capitalization at a level consistent with investment-grade debt ratings. to the extent that operating cash flows are in excess of planned investments, cash may be used to reduce outstanding debt or may be paid as a dividend, or both, in appropriate amounts to maintain the capital structure. to the extent that operating cash flows are insufficient to support planned investments, system energy may issue incremental debt or reduce dividends, or both, to maintain its capital structure. 414 table of contents system energy resources, inc. management's financial discussion and analysis uses of capital system energy requires capital resources for:

416 table of contents system energy resources, inc. management's financial discussion and analysis entergy mississippi, and entergy new orleans under separate agreements. the current return on equity under the unit power sales agreement is 10.94% , which was established in a rate proceeding that became final in july 2001. the apsc and mpsc complaint alleges that the return on equity is unjust and unreasonable because capital market and other considerations indicate that it is excessive. the complaint requests the ferc to institute proceedings to investigate the return on equity and establish a lower return on equity, and also requests that the ferc establish january 23, 2017 as a refund effective date. the complaint includes return on equity analysis that purports to establish that the range of reasonable return on equity for system energy is between 8.37% and 8.67% . system energy answered the complaint in february 2017 and disputes that a return on equity of 8.37% to 8.67% is just and reasonable. the lpsc and the city council intervened in the proceeding expressing support for the complaint. system energy is recording a provision against revenue for the potential outcome of this proceeding. in september 2017 the ferc established a refund effective date of january 23, 2017 and directed the parties to engage in settlement proceedings before an alj. the parties have been unable to settle the return on equity issue and a ferc hearing judge was assigned in july 2018. the 15-month refund period in connection with the apsc/mpsc complaint expired on april 23, 2018. in april 2018 the lpsc filed a complaint with the ferc against system energy seeking an additional
15-month refund period. the lpsc complaint requests similar relief from the ferc with respect to system energy's return on equity and also requests the ferc to investigate system energy's capital structure. the apsc, mpsc, and city council intervened in the proceeding, filed an answer expressing support for the complaint, and asked the ferc to consolidate this proceeding with the proceeding initiated by the complaint of the apsc and mpsc in january 2017.
system energy answered the lpsc complaint in may 2018 and also filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. the
2018 the ferc issued an order dismissing the lpsc's request to investigate system energy's capital structure and setting for hearing the return on equity complaint, with a refund effective date of april 27, 2018. the portion of the lpsc's complaint dealing with return on equity was subsequently consolidated with the apsc and mpsc complaint for hearing. the parties are required to address an order (issued in a separate proceeding involving new england transmission owners) that proposed modifying the ferc's standard methodology for determining return on equity. in september 2018, system energy filed a request for rehearing and the lpsc filed a request for rehearing or reconsideration of the ferc's august 2018 order. the lpsc's request referenced an amended complaint that it filed on the same day raising the same capital structure claim the ferc had earlier dismissed. the ferc initiated a new proceeding for the amended capital structure complaint, and system energy submitted a response in october 2018. in january 2019 the ferc set the amended complaint for settlement and hearing proceedings. settlement proceedings in the capital structure proceeding commenced in february 2019. as noted below, in june 2019 settlement discussions were terminated and the amended capital structure complaint was consolidated with the ongoing return on equity proceeding. the 15-month refund period in connection with the capital structure complaint is from september 24,
2018 to december 23, 2019. in january 2019 the lpsc and the apsc and mpsc filed direct testimony in the return on equity proceeding. for the refund period january 23, 2017 through april 23, 2018, the lpsc argues for an authorized return on equity for system energy of 7.81% and the apsc and mpsc argue for an authorized return on equity for system energy of 8.24% . for the refund period april 27, 2018 through july 27, 2019, and for application on a prospective basis, the lpsc argues for an authorized return on equity for system energy of 7.97% and the apsc and mpsc argue for an authorized return on equity for system energy of 8.41% . in march 2019, system energy submitted answering testimony in the return on equity proceeding. for the first refund period, system energy's testimony argues for a return on equity of 10.10% (median) or 10.70% (midpoint). for the second refund period, system energy's testimony shows that the calculated returns on equity for the first period fall within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity, and thus the second complaint should be dismissed (and the first period return on equity used going forward). if the ferc nonetheless were to set a new return on equity for the second period (and going forward), system energy argues the return on equity should be either 10.32% (median)
or 10.69% (midpoint). 417 table of contents system energy resources, inc. management's financial discussion and analysis in may 2019 the ferc trial staff filed its direct and answering testimony in the return on equity proceeding. for the first refund period, the ferc trial staff calculates an authorized return on equity for system energy of 9.89% based on the application of ferc's proposed methodology. the ferc trial staff's direct and answering testimony noted that an authorized return on equity of 9.89% for the first refund period was within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second refund period, as calculated using a study period ending january 31, 2019 for the second refund period. in june 2019, system entergy filed testimony responding to the testimony filed by the ferc trial staff. among other things, system energy's testimony rebutted arguments raised by the ferc trial staff and provided updated calculations for the second refund period based on the study period ending may 31, 2019. for that refund period, system energy's testimony shows that strict application of the return on equity methodology proposed by the ferc staff indicates that the second complaint would not be dismissed, and the new return on equity would be set at 9.65% (median) or 9.74% (midpoint). system energy's testimony argues that these results are insufficient in light of benchmarks such as state returns on equity and treasury bond yields, and instead proposes that the calculated returns on equity for the second period should be either 9.91% (median) or 10.3% (midpoint). system energy's testimony also argues that, under application of its proposed modified methodology, the 10.10% return on equity calculated for the first refund period would fall within the range of presumptively just and reasonable returns on equity for the second refund period. system energy is recording a provision against revenue for the potential outcome of this proceeding. also in june 2019, the ferc's chief alj issued an order terminating settlement discussions in the amended complaint addressing system energy's capital structure. the alj consolidated the amended capital structure complaint with the ongoing return on equity proceeding and set new procedural deadlines for the consolidated hearing. in august 2019 the lpsc and the apsc and mpsc filed rebuttal testimony in the return on equity proceeding and direct and answering testimony relating to system energy's capital structure. the lpsc reargues for an authorized return on equity for system energy of 7.81% for the first refund period and 7.97% for the second refund period. the apsc and mpsc argue for an authorized return on equity for system energy of 8.26% for the first refund period and 8.32% for the second refund period. with respect to capital structure, the lpsc proposes that the ferc establish a hypothetical capital structure for system energy for ratemaking purposes. specifically, the lpsc proposes that system energy's common equity ratio be set to entergy corporation's equity ratio of 37% equity and 63% debt. in the alternative, the lpsc argues that the equity ratio should be no higher than 49% , the composite equity ratio of system energy and the other entergy operating companies who purchase under the unit power sales agreement. the apsc and mpsc recommend that 35.98% be set as the common equity ratio for system energy. as an alternative, the apsc and mpsc propose that system energy's common equity be set at 46.75% based on the median equity ratio of the proxy group for setting the return on equity. in september 2019 the ferc trial staff filed its rebuttal testimony in the return on equity proceeding. for the first refund period, the ferc trial staff calculates an authorized return on equity for system energy of 9.40% based on the application of the ferc's proposed methodology and an updated proxy group. for the second refund period, based on the study period ending may 31, 2019, the ferc trial staff rebuttal testimony argues for a return on equity of 9.63% . in september 2019 the ferc trial staff also filed direct and answering testimony relating to system energy's capital structure. the ferc trial staff argues that the average capital structure of the proxy group used to develop system energy's return on equity should be used to establish the capital structure.
using this approach, the ferc trial staff calculates the average capital structure for its proposed proxy group of
46.74% common equity, and 53.26% debt. in october 2019, system energy filed answering testimony disputing the ferc trial staff's, the lpsc's, and the apsc's and mpsc's arguments for the use of a hypothetical capital structure and arguing that the use of system energy's actual capital structure is just and reasonable. in november 2019, in a proceeding that did not involve entergy, the ferc issued an order addressing the methodology for determining the return on equity applicable to transmission owners in miso. thereafter, the participants the system energy proceeding agreed to amend the procedural schedule to allow the participants to file testimony addressing the order in the miso transmission owner proceeding. under the new schedule, the hearing in the system energy proceeding will commence in june 2020 and the initial decision will be due in october 2020. 418 table of contents system energy resources, inc. management's financial discussion and analysis grand gulf sale-leaseback renewal complaint in may
2018 the lpsc filed a complaint against system energy and entergy services related to system energy's renewal of a sale-leaseback transaction originally entered into in december 1988 for an 11.5% undivided interest in grand gulf unit 1. the complaint alleges that system energy violated the filed rate and the ferc's ratemaking and accounting requirements when it included in unit power sales agreement billings the cost of capital additions associated with the sale-leaseback interest, and that system energy is double-recovering costs by including both the lease payments and the capital additions in unit power sales agreement billings. the complaint also claims that system energy was imprudent in entering into the sale-leaseback renewal because the utility operating companies that purchase grand gulf's output from system energy could have obtained cheaper capacity and energy in the miso markets. the complaint further alleges that system energy violated various other reporting and accounting requirements and should have sought prior ferc approval of the lease renewal. the complaint seeks various forms of relief from the ferc. the complaint seeks refunds for capital addition costs for all years in which they were recorded in allegedly non-
formula accounts or, alternatively, the disallowance of the return on equity for the capital additions in those years plus interest. the complaint also asks that the ferc disallow and refund the lease costs of the sale-
leaseback renewal on grounds of imprudence, investigate system energy's treatment of a doe litigation payment, and impose certain forward-looking procedural protections, including audit rights for retail regulators of the unit power sales agreement formula rates. the apsc, mpsc, and city council intervened in the proceeding. in june 2018, system energy and entergy services filed a motion to dismiss and an answer to the lpsc complaint denying that system energy's treatment of the sale-leaseback renewal and capital additions violated the terms of the filed rate or any other ferc ratemaking, accounting, or legal requirements or otherwise constituted double recovery. the response also argued that the complaint is inconsistent with a ferc-approved settlement to which the lpsc is a party and that explicitly authorizes system energy to recover its lease payments. finally, the response argued that both the capital additions and the sale-leaseback renewal were prudent investments and the lpsc complaint fails to justify any disallowance or refunds. the response also offered to submit formula rate protocols for the unit power sales agreement similar to the procedures used for reviewing transmission rates under the miso tariff. in september
2018 the ferc issued an order setting the complaint for hearing and settlement proceedings. the ferc established a refund effective date of may 18, 2018. in february 2019 the presiding alj ruled that the hearing ordered by the ferc includes the issue of whether specific subcategories of accumulated deferred income tax should be included in, or excluded from, system energy's formula rate. in march 2019 the lpsc, mpsc, apsc and city council filed direct testimony. the lpsc testimony seeks refunds that include the renewal lease payments (approximately $17.2 million per year since july 2015), rate base reductions for accumulated deferred income tax associated with uncertain tax positions (claimed to be approximately $334.5 million as of december 2018), and the cost of capital additions associated with the sale-leaseback interest (claimed to be approximately $274.8 million ), as well as interest on those amounts. the direct testimony of the city council and the apsc and mpsc address various issues raised by the lpsc. system energy disputes that any refunds are owed for billings under the unit power sales agreement. in june
2019 system energy filed answering testimony in the sale-leaseback complaint proceeding arguing that the ferc should reject all claims for refunds. among other things, system energy argued that claims for refunds of the costs of lease renewal payments and capital additions should be rejected because those costs were recovered consistent with the unit power sales agreement formula rate, system energy was not over or double recovering any costs, and ratepayers will save approximately $850 million over initial and renewal terms of the leases. system energy argued that claims for refunds associated with liabilities arising from uncertain tax positions should be rejected because the liabilities do not provide cost-free capital, the repayment timing of the liabilities is uncertain, and the outcome of the underlying tax positions is uncertain. system energy's testimony also challenged the refund calculations supplied by the other parties. 419 table of contents system energy resources, inc. management's financial discussion and analysis in august 2019 the ferc trial staff filed direct and answering testimony seeking refunds for rate base reductions for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions (claimed to be up to approximately $602 million plus interest). the ferc trial staff also argued that system energy recovered $32
million more than it should have in depreciation expense for capital additions. in september 2019, system energy filed cross-answering testimony disputing the ferc trial staff's arguments for refunds, stating that the ferc trial staff's position regarding depreciation rates for capital additions is not unreasonable and explaining that any change in depreciation expense is only one element of a unit power sales agreement rebilling calculation.
adjustments to depreciation expense in any rebilling under the unit power sales agreement formula rate will also involve changes to accumulated depreciation, accumulated deferred income taxes, and other formula elements as needed. in october 2019 the lpsc filed rebuttal testimony increasing the amount of refunds sought for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. the lpsc now seeks approximately $512 million plus interest. at the same time, the ferc trial staff filed rebuttal testimony conceding that it was no longer seeking up to $602 million related to the uncertain tax positions; instead, it is seeking approximately $511 million plus interest. the lpsc also argued that adjustments to depreciation rates should affect rate base on a prospective basis only. a hearing was held before a ferc alj in november 2019 and the initial decision is due in april 2020. unit power sales agreement in august 2017, system energy submitted to the ferc proposed amendments to the unit power sales agreement pursuant to which system energy sells its grand gulf capacity and energy to entergy arkansas, entergy louisiana, entergy mississippi, and entergy new orleans. the filing proposes limited amendments to the unit power sales agreement to adopt (1) updated rates for use in calculating grand gulf plant depreciation and amortization expenses and (2) updated nuclear decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements, both of which are recovered through the unit power sales agreement rate formula. the amendments result in lower charges to the utility operating companies that buy capacity and energy from system energy under the unit power sales agreement. the changes were based on updated depreciation and nuclear decommissioning studies that take into account the renewal of grand gulf's operating license for a term through november 1, 2044. in september 2017 the ferc accepted system energy's proposed unit power sales agreement amendments, subject to further proceedings to consider the justness and reasonableness of the amendments. because the amendments propose a rate decrease, the ferc also initiated an investigation under section 206 of the federal power act to determine if the rate decrease should be lower than proposed. the ferc accepted the proposed amendments effective october 1, 2017, subject to refund pending the outcome of the further settlement and/or hearing proceedings, and established a refund effective date of october 11, 2017 with respect to the rate decrease. in june 2018, system energy filed with the ferc an uncontested settlement relating to the updated depreciation rates and nuclear decommissioning cost annual revenue requirements. in august 2018 the ferc issued an order accepting the settlement. in the third quarter 2018, system energy recorded a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately $26 million , representing the cumulative difference in depreciation expense resulting from the depreciation rates used from october 11, 2017 through september 30, 2018 and the depreciation rates included in the settlement filing accepted by the ferc. nuclear matters system energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates grand gulf. system energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. these include risks related to: the use, storage, and handling and disposal of high-level and low-
level radioactive materials; the substantial financial requirements, both for capital investments and operational needs, to position entergy's nuclear fleet to meet its operational goals, including the financial requirements to address emerging issues like stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the plant systems and the fukushima event; regulatory requirements and potential future regulatory changes, including changes affecting the regulations governing nuclear plant ownership, operations, license renewal and amendments, and decommissioning; the performance and capacity factors of these nuclear plants; the availability of interim or permanent sites for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste, including the fees charged for such disposal; the sufficiency 420

regulation of entergy's business - environmental regulation " in part i, item 1. because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. critical accounting estimates the preparation of system energy's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of system energy's financial position or results of operations. nuclear decommissioning costs see " nuclear decommissioning costs " in the " critical accounting estimates " section of entergy corporation and subsidiaries management's financial discussion and analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

2019 executive compensation program changes during 2019, the following changes were made to entergy corporation's executive officer compensation programs: annual incentive plan in recognition of entergy corporation's successful execution on its strategy to exit the entergy wholesale commodities merchant power business, entergy corporation decided to establish a new, single earnings measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap") for guidance 444 table of contents and investor reporting purposes that would better reflect its ongoing business and respond to feedback received from investors on the earnings measures on which entergy corporation had previously reported and guided. this new measure, entergy adjusted earnings per share ("etr adjusted eps"), adjusts the company's as reported (gaap) earnings per share results to eliminate the impact of its entergy wholesale commodities merchant power business, significant tax items and other non-routine items. with this change in the external guidance measure, and given the personnel committee's desire to maintain an appropriate degree of alignment between the company's externally communicated earnings targets and the targets under the annual incentive plan, the committee adopted new performance measures to determine the maximum funding level of the annual incentive plan with each performance measure weighted equally:
the earnings measure, etr tax adjusted eps, is based on the externally reported etr adjusted eps, which is
•  then adjusted to add back the effect of significant tax items, and to eliminate the effect of major storms, the resolution of certain unresolved regulatory litigation matters, changes in federal income tax law and unrealized gains or losses on equity securities (the "pre-determined exclusions").
•  the cash flow measure, etr adjusted operating cash flow is calculated based on entergy corporation's as-reported (gaap) operating cash flow, adjusted to eliminate the effect of any pre-determined exclusions.
long-term incentives in keeping with the change in entergy corporation's external guidance measure, the committee also adopted a new earnings measure for use in measuring performance under the long-term performance unit program.
in particular, the committee decided that, for the 2019-2021 the long-term performance unit program period, the performance measures will be (1) cumulative etr adjusted eps, adjusted to eliminate the effect of any pre-
term incentive targets tailored to role beginning in 2019, the short and long-term incentive targets for officers who are members of entergy corporation's office of the chief executive are being determined based on job-specific market data for the officer's role. previously, the targets were the average of the market data for the officers within a specific management level, without regard to the officer's specific job functions. the targets for the named executive officers who are presidents of the utility operating companies continue to be determined based on the average of the market data for the officers within a specific management level, without regard to their specific job function. entergy corporation believes that this change for the members of the office of the chief executive will help assure that each officer's incentive targets are market competitive with respect to the officer's particular role. 2019 incentive pay outcomes entergy corporation believes the 2019 incentive pay outcomes for the named executive officers demonstrated the application of entergy corporation's pay for performance philosophy. annual incentive plan awards under the executive annual incentive plan, or annual incentive plan, are tied to entergy corporation's financial and operational performance through the entergy achievement multiplier
("eam"), which is the performance metric used to determine the maximum funding available for awards under the plan.
the 2019 eam was determined based on the two equally weighted performance metrics discussed in the "2019 executive compensation program changes" section above. 445 table of contents 2019 annual incentive plan payout for 2019, the personnel committee, based on the recommendation of the finance committee, determined that management exceeded its etr tax adjusted eps goal of $5.30 per share by $1.23 per share and fell short of its etr adjusted operating cash flow goal of $3.1 billion by approximately $134 million. based on the targets and ranges previously established by the personnel committee, these results resulted in a calculated eam of 139%. long-term performance unit program under the long-term performance unit program, units are granted with performance measured over a three-year period based on entergy corporation's total shareholder return in relation to the total shareholder return of the companies included in the philadelphia utility index. payouts, if any, are based on entergy corporation's performance on these measures against pre-established performance goals. long-term performance unit program payout for the three-year performance period ending in 2019, entergy corporation's total shareholder return was in the top quartile of the companies in the philadelphia utility index, yielding a payout of 200% of target for the named executive officers. payouts were made in shares of entergy corporation stock which are required to be held by the executive officers until they satisfy the executive stock ownership guidelines. what entergy corporation pays and why competitive positioning market data for compensation comparison annually, the personnel committee reviews:
•  data from utility companies to determine total cash compensation for management roles that are utility-specific, such as group president, utility operations; and
•  utility market data to determine long-term incentives for all positions.
how the personnel committee uses the market data the personnel committee uses this survey data to develop compensation opportunities that are designed to deliver total target compensation within a targeted range of approximately the 50 th percentile of the surveyed companies in the aggregate. in most cases, the committee considers its objectives to have been met if entergy corporation's chief executive officer and the eight other executive officers (including the applicable named executive officers) who constitute the office of the chief executive each has a target compensation opportunity that falls within a targeted range of 85% - 115% of the 50 th percentile of the survey data. in general, compensation levels for an executive officer who is new to a position tend to be at the lower end of the competitive range, while seasoned executive officers with strong performance who are viewed as critical to retain would be positioned at the higher end of the competitive range. generally, differences in the levels of total direct compensation among the named executive officers are primarily driven by the scope of their responsibilities, differences in the competitive market pay range for similar positions and considerations of internal pay equity. 446 table of contents proxy peer group although the survey data described above are the primary data used in benchmarking compensation, the committee uses compensation information from the companies included in the philadelphia utility index to evaluate the overall reasonableness of entergy corporation's compensation programs and to determine relative total shareholder return for the 2017-2019 long-term performance unit program awards. companies included in the philadelphia utility index at the time the proxy data was compiled were as follows:

447 table of contents fixed compensation base salary the personnel committee determines the base salaries for all of the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive based on competitive compensation data, performance considerations, and advice provided by the committee's independent compensation consultant. for the other named executive officers, their salaries are established by their immediate supervisors using the same criteria. the base salaries of the named executive officers are considered annually as part of the performance review process, and upon a named executive officer's promotion or other change in job responsibilities.
in 2019, all of the named executive officers, other than mr. denault, received merit increases in their base salaries ranging from approximately 2.5% to 4.5%. in 2019, mr. denault did not receive a merit increase in his base salary. instead, the personnel committee increased mr. denault's tdc by increasing his annual and long-term incentive target opportunities; thus, increasing the share of his compensation that is "at risk." the increases in base salary were based on the market data previously discussed in this cd&a under "what entergy corporation pays and why." the following table sets forth the 2018 and 2019 base salaries for the named executive officers. changes in base salaries for 2019 were effective in april.

variable compensation short-term incentive compensation annual incentive plan awards under the executive annual incentive plan, or annual incentive plan, are tied to entergy corporation's financial and operational performance through the eam, which is the performance metric used to determine the maximum funding available for awards under the plan. entergy corporation uses the following process to determine annual incentive awards:
establish performance measures to determine eam pool.annually, the personnel committee engages in a rigorous process to determine the performance measures used to determine the eam.  the personnel committee's goal is to establish measures that are consistent with entergy corporation's strategy and business objectives for
•  the upcoming year, as reflected in its financial plan, and are designed to drive results that represent a high level of achievement.  these measures are approved based on a comprehensive review by the full board of entergy corporation's financial plan, conducted in december of the preceding year and updated in january to reflect key drivers of anticipated changes in performance from the preceding year.
448 table of contents establish target achievement levels.in january, after entergy corporation's financial plan is updated to
•  reflect any changes from that reviewed in december, the personnel committee establishes the specific targets that must be achieved for each performance measure.  the personnel committee also seeks to assure that the targets:
◦  take into account changes in the business environment and specific challenges facing entergy corporation;
◦  reflect an appropriate balancing of the various risks and opportunities recognized at the time the targets are set; and
◦  are aligned with external expectations communicated to entergy corporation's shareholders.
establish named officer target opportunities.in january of each year, the personnel committee establishes the target opportunities for the members of the office of the chief executive based on its review of the competitive analysis of job-specific market data prepared by pay governance as well as the officer's role, individual performance and internal equity considerations.  for the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive (messrs. bakken, brown, denault, marsh and west), target award opportunities are established based on these factors.  for the other named executive officers, target award

2019 targets using the process described above, in december 2018, the personnel committee decided to use etr tax adjusted eps and etr adjusted operating cash flow, with each measure weighted equally, as the performance measures for determining the 2019 eam pool. etr tax adjusted eps is based on etr adjusted eps, which is the primary earnings measure used by the company externally and the measure on which it provides annual earnings guidance, which is then adjusted to add back the effect of any significant tax items that were excluded to arrive at etr adjusted eps and to eliminate the effects, if any, of the pre-determined exclusions. etr adjusted operating cash flow is calculated based on entergy corporation's as-reported (gaap) operating cash flow, adjusted to eliminate the effect of any pre-
determined exclusions. the personnel committee determined that etr tax adjusted eps and etr adjusted operating cash flow were the appropriate metrics to use for this purpose because:
•  they are based on objective financial measures that entergy corporation and its investors consider to be important in evaluating its financial performance;
•  they are based on the same metrics we use for internal and external financial reporting; and
449 table of contents the personnel committee considered it appropriate to use etr tax adjusted eps, which adds back the effect of significant tax items that may have been excluded from etr adjusted eps, as the earnings measure because of the significant benefits to entergy corporation resulting from such tax items and the management effort required to achieve them. the personnel committee also considered the appropriateness of excluding the effect of each of the pre-determined exclusions from each of the financial measures. it viewed the exclusion of major storms as appropriate because although entergy corporation includes estimates for storm costs in its financial plan, it does not include estimates for a major storm event, such as a hurricane. the personnel committee considered the exclusion of any unanticipated effects of the tax reform legislation adopted at the end of 2017 to be appropriate because of the lingering uncertainty around those effects and the inability of management to impact those results.
the personnel committee approved the other exclusions from reported results - for the impact of certain legacy unresolved regulatory litigation and unanticipated unrealized gains and losses on securities held by entergy corporation's nuclear decommissioning trusts - primarily because of management's inability to influence either of the related outcomes. in determining the targets to set for 2019, the personnel committee reviewed anticipated drivers for consolidated operational earnings per share and consolidated operational operating cash flow for 2019
as set forth in entergy corporation's financial plan, as well as factors driving the strong financial performance achieved in 2018. the personnel committee confirmed that the proposed plan targets for etr tax adjusted eps and etr adjusted operating cash flow reflected substantial growth in the core weather-adjusted utility earnings and consolidated operating cash flow measures underlying the annual incentive plan targets. the personnel committee also considered the potential impact of a wide range of identified risks and opportunities and confirmed that there appeared to be more downside risk than upside opportunity embedded in the financial plan targets and, as a result, the personnel committee believed that the related annual incentive plan targets reflected a reasonable degree of challenge. 2019 performance assessment the following table shows the 2019 incentive plan targets established by the personnel committee and 2019 results: annual incentive plan targets and results performance goals(1)

in january 2020, the finance and personnel committees jointly reviewed entergy corporation's financial results against the performance objectives reflected in the table above. management discussed with the committees entergy corporation's etr tax adjusted eps and etr adjusted operating cash flow results for 2019, including primary factors explaining how those results compared to the 2019 business plan and annual incentive plan targets set in january
2019. etr tax adjusted eps exceeded entergy corporation's etr tax adjusted eps target of $5.30 per share by $1.23, but management fell short of achieving its etr adjusted operating cash flow target of $3.1 billion by approximately
$134 million, leading to a calculated eam of 139%. none of the pre-determined exclusions resulted in any adjustment to etr tax adjusted eps and etr adjusted operating cash flow. 450 table of contents in addition to the foregoing results, the personnel committee considered management's degree of success in achieving various operational and regulatory goals set out at the beginning of the year and in overcoming certain challenges that arose in the business during the course of the year. the personnel committee also considered (i) the entergy corporation's degree of success in achieving its published earnings guidance, which it exceeded by $0.10 per share at the midpoint of the original guidance range for etr adjusted eps provided at the beginning of the year and by $0.05 per share at the midpoint of the adjusted guidance range published in july 2019, and (ii) total shareholder return for
2019 in relation to the philadelphia utility index, which placed entergy corporation in the top quartile of companies in the index with a total shareholder return of 44.3% for the year. finally, the committee reviewed the impact on etr tax adjusted eps and etr adjusted operating cash flow of significant tax items that were included in the results and additional pension contributions made during the year beyond those that were required or included in the initial 2019 financial plan. following this review, the personnel committee decided to approve the eam as calculated in accordance with the plan design. to determine individual executive officer awards under the annual incentive plan for the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive, the personnel committee considered not only each executive's role in executing on entergy corporation's strategies and delivering the strong financial performance achieved in 2018, but also the individual's accountability for certain operational and regulatory challenges it experienced during the year. with these considerations in mind, the committee exercised negative discretion to determine individual awards that ranged from 135% to 137% of target for each of the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive, with the extent of the negative discretion applied varying based on the executive's specific accountabilities and accomplishments. after the eam was established to determine overall funding for the annual incentive plan, entergy corporation's chief executive officer allocated incentive award funding to individual business units based on business unit results. individual awards were determined for the remaining named executive officers who are not members of the office of the chief executive by their immediate supervisor based on the individual officer's key accountabilities, accomplishments, and performance. this resulted in payouts that ranged from 127% of target to 208% of target for the named executive officers who are not members of the office of the chief executive. based on the foregoing evaluation of management performance, the named executive officers received the following annual incentive plan payouts for 2019:

long-term incentive compensation long-term incentive compensation, consisting solely of equity awards in 2019, represents the largest portion of the named executive officers' compensation. entergy corporation's believes the combination of long-term incentives we employ acts in retaining the senior management team, and aligns the interests of the executive officers 451 table of contents with the interests of entergy corporation's shareholders and customers by enhancing executives' focus on the company's long-term goals. in general, entergy corporation seeks to allocate the total value of long-term incentive compensation 60% to performance units and 40% to a combination of stock options and restricted stock, equally divided in value, based on the value the compensation model seeks to deliver. awards for individual named executive officers may vary from this target as a result of individual performance, promotions, and internal pay equity. 2019 long-term incentive award mix beginning in 2019, a dollar value was established for the target long-term incentive awards for each named executive officer who is a member of the office of the chief executive. the targeted award value for these officers was determined based on market median compensation data for the officer's role, adjusted to reflect individual performance and internal equity. previously, the targets for these named executive officers were the average of the market data for the officers within a specific management level, without regard to the officer's specific job functions. in january
2019, the personnel committee approved the 2019 long-term incentive award target values for the named executive officers who are members of the office of the chief executive. this value was then converted into the number of performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock granted using the allocation described above based on the target grant date value. in consultation with entergy corporation's chief executive officer, the personnel committee reviews each of the other named executive officer's performance, role and responsibilities, strengths, developmental opportunities and internal equity and allocates awards of restricted stock and stock options to each of these officers based on these factors. grants of long-term performance units for these named executive officers was determined based on the average of the market data for the officers within a specific management level, without regard to the officer's specific job function. performance unit program the named executive officers are issued performance unit awards under the long-term performance unit program.
•  each performance unit represents one share of entergy corporation's common stock at the end of the three-year performance period, plus dividends accrued during the performance period.
•  the performance units and accrued dividends on any shares earned during the performance period are settled in shares of entergy corporation common stock.
•  the personnel committee sets payout opportunities for the program at the outset of each performance period, with payouts only occurring if the performance goals are met.

the long-term performance unit program specifies a minimum, target and maximum achievement level, the achievement of which will determine the number of performance units that may be earned by each participant. for the 2019 - 2021
performance period, the personnel committee chose the performance measures and targets set forth below. given the economic and market conditions at the time the targets were set, the target payout level for the cumulative etr adjusted eps goal was designed to be challenging, but achievable while payout at the maximum levels was designed to require stretch performance. 452 table of contents 2019-2021 long-term performance unit performance period measures and goals (1)

stock options and restricted stock entergy corporation grants stock options and shares of restricted stock because they align the interests of the executive officers with long-term shareholder value, provide competitive compensation, and increase the executives' ownership in entergy corporation common stock. generally, stock options are granted with a maximum term of ten years, and vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. the exercise price for each option granted in 2019 was $89.19, which was the closing price of entergy's common stock on the date of grant. shares of restricted stock vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, are paid dividends which are 453 table of contents reinvested in shares of entergy stock and have the ability to vote. the dividend reinvestment shares are subject to forfeiture similar to the terms of the original grant. 2019 long-term incentive awards in january 2019, the personnel committee granted the following long-term performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock to each named executive officer. the number of long-term performance units, stock options and shares of restricted stock were determined as discussed above under "long-term incentive compensation - 2019 long-term incentive award mix."

entergy corporation provides these benefits to the named executive officers as part of its effort to provide a competitive executive compensation program and because it believes that these benefits are important retention and recruitment tools since many of the companies with which it competes for executive talent provide similar arrangements to their senior executive officers. 456 table of contents severance and other compensation arrangements the personnel committee believes that retention and transitional compensation arrangements are an important part of overall compensation as they help to secure the continued employment and dedication of the named executive officers, notwithstanding any concern that they might have at the time of a change in control regarding their own continued employment. in addition, the personnel committee believes that these arrangements are important as recruitment and retention devices, as many of the companies with which entergy corporation competes for executive talent have similar arrangements in place for their senior employees. to achieve these objectives, entergy corporation has established a system executive continuity plan under which ml 1-4 officers are entitled to receive "change in control" payments and benefits if such officer's employment is involuntarily terminated in connection with a change in control of entergy corporation and its subsidiaries. entergy corporation strives to ensure that the benefits and payment levels under the system executive continuity plan are consistent with market practices. entergy corporation's executive officers, including the named executive officers, are not entitled to any tax gross up payments on any severance benefits received under this plan. for more information regarding the system executive continuity plan, see "2019 potential payments upon termination or change in control." in certain cases, the personnel committee may approve the execution of a retention agreement with an individual executive officer. these decisions are made on a case by case basis to reflect specific retention needs or other factors, including market practice. if a retention agreement is entered into with an individual officer, the committee considers the economic value associated with that agreement in making overall compensation decisions for that officer. mr. ellis in connection with the commencement of his employment as president, entergy new orleans, mr.
ellis was eligible for certain relocation benefits pursuant to entergy corporation's relocation assistance policy, including assistance with moving expenses, transportation of household goods and assistance with the sale of his home. mr. ellis also received a sign-on bonus of $200,000 when he assumed this role. mr. ellis's sign-on bonus and certain of his relocation benefits are subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances if mr. ellis's employment is terminated within 24 months of the commencement of his employment. also, in accordance with the terms of the long-term performance unit program in january 2019, mr. ellis received pro-rated target award opportunities for the
2017-2019 and 2018-2020 performance periods. nuclear retention plan mr. bakken participates in the nuclear retention plan, a retention plan for officers and other leaders with expertise in the nuclear industry. the personnel committee authorized this plan to attract and retain key management and employee talent in the nuclear power field, a field that requires unique technical and other expertise that is in great demand in the utility industry. the plan provides for bonuses to be paid annually over a three-year service period with the bonus opportunity dependent on the participant's management level and continued employment. each annual payment is equal to an amount ranging from 15% to 30% of the employee's base salary as of their date of enrollment in the plan. mr.
bakken's participation in the plan commenced in may 2016, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan, in may 2017, 2018 and 2019, mr. bakken received a cash bonus equal to $181,500 or 30% of his may 1, 2016 base salary. this plan does not provide for accelerated or prorated payout upon termination of any kind. compensation policies and practices entergy corporation strives to ensure that its compensation philosophy and practices are in line with the best practices of companies in its industry as well as other companies in the s&p 500. some of these practices include the following: 457 table of contents clawback provisions entergy corporation has adopted a clawback policy that covers all individuals subject to section 16 of the exchange act, including the members of the office of the chief executive. under the policy, which goes beyond the requirements of sarbanes-oxley act of 2002
(sarbanes-oxley), the personnel committee will require reimbursement of incentives paid to these executive officers where:
(i) the payment was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results with respect to the applicable performance period that were subsequently determined to be the subject of a material restatement
•  other than a restatement due to changes in accounting policy; or (ii) a material miscalculation of a performance award occurs, whether or not the financial statements were restated and, in either such case, a lower payment would have been made to the executive officer based upon the restated financial results or correct calculation; or in the board of directors' view, the executive officer engaged in fraud that caused or partially caused the
•  need for a restatement or caused a material miscalculation of a performance award, in each case, whether or not the financial statements were restated.
the amount the personnel committee requires to be reimbursed is equal to the excess of the gross incentive payment made over the gross payment that would have been made if the original payment had been determined based on the restated financial results or correct calculation. further, following a material restatement of entergy corporation's financial statements, entergy corporation will seek to recover any compensation received by entergy corporation's chief executive officer and chief financial officer that is required to be reimbursed under sarbanes-
oxley. stock ownership guidelines and share retention requirements for many years, entergy corporation has had stock ownership guidelines for executives, including the named executive officers. these guidelines are designed to align the executives' long-term financial interests with the interests of entergy corporation's shareholders.
annually, the personnel committee monitors the executive officers' compliance with these guidelines. the ownership guidelines are as follows:
role                       value of common stock to be owned chief executive officer    6 times base salary executive vice presidents  3 times base salary senior vice presidents     2 times base salary vice presidents            1 time base salary further, to facilitate compliance with the guidelines, until an executive officer satisfies the stock ownership guidelines, the officer must retain:
•  all net after-tax shares paid out under the long-term performance unit program;
•  all net after-tax shares of the restricted stock and restricted stock units received upon vesting; and
•  at least 75% of the after-tax net shares received upon the exercise of entergy corporation stock options.

(7)  increase in pension benefits for all of the named executive officers in 2019 was driven by a decline in the discount rate that was a result of the decrease in prevailing interest rates.  none of the increases for any of the named executive officers is attributable to above-market or preferential earnings on non-qualified deferred compensation.  for 2018, the aggregate change in the actuarial present value was a decrease of pension benefits of $52,000 for mr. fisackerly, $163,000 for mr. marsh, $700 for mr. may,

2019 potential payments upon termination or change in control entergy corporation has plans and other arrangements that provide compensation to a named executive officer if his or her employment terminates under specified conditions, including following a change in control of entergy corporation or its subsidiaries. change in control under entergy corporation's system executive continuity plan (the "continuity plan"), ml 1-4 officers are eligible to receive the severance benefits described below if their employment is terminated by their entergy system employer other than for cause or if they terminate their employment for good reason during a period beginning with a potential change in control and ending 24 months following the effective date of a change in control (a
"qualifying termination"). a participant will not be eligible for benefits under the continuity plan if such participant: accepts employment with entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries; elects to receive the benefits of another severance or separation program; removes, copies or fails to return any property belonging to entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates his or her non-compete provision (which generally runs for two years but extends to three years if permissible under applicable law). entergy corporation does not have any plans or agreements that provide for payments or benefits to any of the named executive officers solely upon a change in control. 477 table of contents in the event of a qualifying termination, executive officers, including the named executive officers, generally will receive the benefits set forth below:
compensation element  payment a lump sum severance payment equal to a multiple of the sum of:  (a) the participant's annual base salary as in effect at any time within one year prior to the commencement of severance*            a change of control period or, if higher, immediately prior to a circumstance constituting good reason, plus (b) the participant's annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive plan for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which termination occurs.
participants will forfeit outstanding performance units, and in lieu of any payment for any outstanding performance period, will receive a single-lump sum payment calculated by performance units     multiplying the target performance units for the most recent performance period preceding
(but not including) the calendar year in which termination occurs by the closing price of entergy's common stock as of the later of the date of such termination or the date of the change in control.
all unvested stock options, shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units will equity awards         vest immediately upon a "double trigger" qualifying termination pursuant to the terms of the equity ownership plan.
retirement benefits   benefits already accrued under the system executive retirement plan, pension equalization plan and cash balance equalization plan, if any, will become fully vested.
welfare benefits      participants who are not retirement-eligible would be eligible to receive entergy-subsidized cobra benefits for a period ranging from 12 to 18 months.
cash severance payments are capped at 2.99 times the sum of (a) an executive's annual base salary plus (b)
the higher of his or her actual annual incentive payment under the annual incentive plan or his or her
*  annual incentive, calculated using the average annual target opportunity derived under the annual incentive plan for the two calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which termination occurs.  any cash severance payments to be paid under the continuity plan in excess of this cap will be forfeited by the participant.
to protect shareholders and entergy corporation's business model, executives are required to comply with non-
compete, non-solicitation, confidentiality and non-denigration provisions. if an executive discloses non-public data or information concerning entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates his or her non-compete provision, he or she will be required to repay any benefits previously received under the continuity plan. for purposes of the continuity plan the following events are generally defined as:
change in control: (a) the purchase of 30% or more of either entergy corporation's common stock or the combined voting power of entergy corporation's voting securities; (b) the merger or consolidation of entergy corporation (unless its board members constitute at least a majority of the board members of the surviving entity); (c) the liquidation, dissolution or sale of all or substantially all of entergy corporation's assets; or (d) a change in the composition of entergy corporation's board such that, during any two-year period, the individuals serving at the beginning of the period no longer constitute a majority of entergy
•  corporation's board at the end of the period.
potential change in control: (a) entergy corporation or an affiliate enters into an agreement the consummation of which would constitute a change in control; (b) the entergy corporation board adopts resolutions determining that, for purposes of the continuity plan, a potential change in control has
•  occurred; (c) a system company or other person or entity publicly announces an intention to take actions that would constitute a change in control; or (d) any person or entity becomes the beneficial owner
(directly or indirectly) of entergy corporation's outstanding shares of common stock constituting 20% or more of the voting power or value of the entergy corporation's outstanding common stock.
478 table of contents cause:the participant's (a) willful and continuous failure to perform substantially his or her  duties after written demand for performance; (b) engagement in conduct that is materially injurious to entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries; (c) conviction or guilty or nolo contendere plea to a felony or
•  other crime that materially and adversely affects either his or her ability to perform his or her duties or entergy corporation's reputation;  (d) material violation of any agreement with entergy corporation or any of its subsidiaries; or (e) disclosure of any of entergy corporation's confidential information without authorization.

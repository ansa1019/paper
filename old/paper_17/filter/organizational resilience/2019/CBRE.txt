item 1a.   risk factors.
set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make. based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business. however, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial (but that later become material) may also adversely affect our business.
risks related to our business environment our performance is significantly related to general economic, political and regulatory conditions and, accordingly, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns, liquidity constraints, significant public health events, such as pandemics, fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values, property sales and leasing activities in the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve.
periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal or political uncertainty, market volatility, declining employment levels, declining demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur, may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines.
our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we operate, which can result in a decline in real estate acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales, leasing, valuation and financing, as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities.
our businesses could also suffer from political or economic disruptions (or the perception that such disruptions may occur) that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial, market or regulatory uncertainty. for example, in 2019, continued uncertainty throughout the year about the date and the terms on which the united kingdom would leave the european union led to lower lease and sales volumes. following the united kingdom's exit from the european union on january 31, 2020, ongoing uncertainty over the country's long-term economic and trade relationship with the european union may continue to cause market volatility and currency fluctuations and adversely impact business and consumer confidence or the economy in general, which may adversely affect business in the united kingdom and other european businesses. these uncertainties and any perception of weakness in the british economy could not only impact the performance of commercial real estate assets located in the united kingdom, but access to funds from investors located in the united kingdom.
adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty or significant public health events, such as pandemics, could also lead to a decline in leasing volume, property sales prices, funds invested in commercial real estate assets or planned development activity, which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees we earn. during 2019, our asia pacific business experienced declines in leasing activity amid rising geopolitical and trade uncertainty and slowing regional economies. furthermore, in december 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan, china, resulting in decreased economic activity in china and concerns about a potential pandemic, which would adversely affect the broader global economy. at this point, the extent to which this coronavirus may impact the global economy and our results is uncertain, but pandemics or other significant public health events, or the perception that such events may occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we also make  co-investments alongside our investor clients in our development and investment management businesses. during an economic downturn, capital for our investment activities could be constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or sale prices we achieve may be lower than originally anticipated. as a result, the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced, and we could realize losses or diminished profitability. in addition, economic downturns may reduce the volume of  loans our capital markets business originates and/or services. fees within our property management business are generally based on a percentage of rent collections, making them sensitive to macro-economic conditions that negatively impact rent collections and the performance of the properties we manage.
economic, political and regulatory uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment, and in the global landscape, make it difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future. as a result, any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on then-current conditions, and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate.
adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our investment management, development services and capital markets (including property sales and mortgage and structured financing services) businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as financial liquidity. additionally, the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity (and pricing) in the commercial real estate markets.
disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners, investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing, disposition and acquisition of property. if our clients are unable to obtain credit on favorable terms, there may be fewer property leasing, disposition and acquisition transactions. in addition, under such conditions, our investment management and development services businesses may be unable to attract capital or achieve returns sufficient to earn incentive fees and we may also experience losses of co-invested equity capital if the disruption causes a prolonged decline in the value of investments made.
our operations are subject to social, political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility.
we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally. during 2019, approximately 42% of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies, the majority of which included the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan, czech koruna, danish krone, euro, hong kong dollar, indian rupee, israeli shekel, japanese yen, korean won, mexican peso, new zealand dollar, polish zloty, singapore dollar, swedish krona, swiss franc and thai baht. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in revenue and earnings as well as the assets under management for our investment management business. over time, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results.
in addition, we are exposed to international economic trends, foreign governmental policy actions and  the following factors that may adversely affect the performance of our business:
•   difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations among diverse geographies, languages and cultures;
•   currency restrictions, transfer-pricing regulations and adverse tax consequences, which may affect our ability to transfer capital and profits;
•   adverse changes in regulatory or tax requirements and regimes or uncertainty about the application of or the future of such regulatory or tax requirements and regimes;
•   responsibility for complying with numerous, potentially conflicting and frequently complex and changing laws in multiple jurisdictions, e.g., with respect to data protection, privacy regulations, corrupt practices, embargoes, trade sanctions, employment and licensing;
•   the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability, including those related to public health or safety events;
•   political and economic instability in certain countries;
•   foreign ownership restrictions in certain countries, particularly in asia pacific and the middle east, or the risk that such restrictions will be adopted in the future; and
•   changes in laws or policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers, and any negative sentiments towards multinational companies as a result of any such changes to laws or policies or due to trends such as political populism and economic nationalism.
we maintain anti-corruption and anti-money-laundering compliance programs throughout the company as well as programs designed to enable us to comply with any potential government economic sanctions, embargoes or other import/export controls. however, coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges. we may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including disgorgement), and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities, to globalize our service offerings and products in select markets and to develop local sales and support channels. if we are unable to successfully implement these plans, maintain adequate long-term strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. in addition, we have established operations and seek to grow our presence in  many emerging markets to further expand our global platform. however, we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business, operational, legal and compliance risks specific to those markets. the political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there.
risks related to our operations we have numerous local, regional and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve, and further industry consolidation, fragmentation or innovation could lead to significant future competition.
we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry, including property management, facilities management, project and transaction management, tenant and landlord leasing, capital markets solutions (property sales, commercial mortgage origination and structured finance), flexible space solutions, real estate investment management, valuation, loan servicing, development services and proprietary research. although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2019 revenue, our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies, property types and services and business lines.
depending on the geography, property type or service or business line, we face competition from other commercial real estate services providers and investment firms, including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time, in-house corporate real estate departments, developers, flexible space providers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers and accounting and consulting firms. some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography, property type or service or business line than we have allocated to that geography, property type, service or business line. in addition, future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors, such as financial institutions.
although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are, some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis. we are further subject to competition from large national and multi-national firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours, and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies, property types, service or business lines that we serve. in addition, disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. furthermore, we are substantially dependent on long-term client relationships and on revenue received for services under various service agreements. many of these agreements may be canceled by the client for any reason with as little as 30 to 60 days' notice, as is typical in the industry.
in this competitive market, if we are unable to maintain long-term client relationships or are otherwise unable to retain existing clients and develop new clients, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, to maintain current fee levels or margins, or maintain or increase our market share.
our growth and financial performance have benefited significantly from acquisitions, which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future.
acquisitions have accounted for a significant component of our growth over time. any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices, terms and conditions, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions. we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, subject to the restrictions contained in the
documents governing our then-existing indebtedness. if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our then-existing debt, would increase. acquisitions involve risks that business judgments made concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove to be incorrect. future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which could include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.
we have had, and may continue to experience, challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies. this could result in the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations. the integration process itself may adversely impact our business and the acquired company's business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems. acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology and accounting and management services.
we complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits, including enhanced or more stable revenues, a strengthened market position, cross-selling opportunities, cost synergies, tax benefits and accretion to our adjusted net income per share. achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated, whether we will experience greater-than-expected attrition from professionals licensed or associated with the acquired companies and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business. failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and operating results.
our success depends upon the retention of our senior management, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees.
our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, including robert e. sulentic, our president and chief executive officer. while certain of our executive officers and key employees are subject to long-term compensatory arrangements, which often include retention incentives and various restrictive covenants, there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all key members of our senior management. we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals, who generate a significant amount of our revenues, as well as other revenue producing professionals. the departure of any of our key employees, or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers, if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements, could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer. competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. in addition, the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business. we and our competitors use equity incentives and sign-on and retention bonuses to help attract, retain and incentivize key personnel. as competition is significant for the services of such personnel, the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase, which could negatively impact our profitability, or result in our inability to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past. any significant decline in, or failure to grow, our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel. if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel, our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer.
if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives.
our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges. it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge. it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations. the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to business and reputational risks. if we are not successful in continuing to develop and implement the processes and tools designed to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our reputation and ability
to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired. in addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change. if we do not successfully implement any such changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted.
our brand and reputation are key assets of our company, and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.
our brand and reputation are key assets, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices, management, workplace culture, financial condition, our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities. negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters, even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones. negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including handling of complaints, regulatory compliance, such as compliance with government sanctions, the foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, the u.k. bribery act and other antibribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, the use and protection of client and other sensitive information and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. furthermore, as a company with headquarters and operations located in the united states, a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand abroad. although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity would materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. social media channels can also cause rapid, widespread reputational harm to our brand. our brand and reputation may also be harmed by the actions of third parties that are outside of our control, including vendors and joint venture partners.
the protection of our brand, including related trademarks, may require the expenditure of significant financial and operational resources. moreover, the steps we take to protect our brand may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks. even when we detect infringement or misappropriation of our trademarks, we may not be able to enforce all such trademarks. any unauthorized use by third parties of our brand may adversely affect our brand. furthermore, as we continue to expand our business, especially internationally, there is a risk we may face claims of infringement or other alleged violations of third-party intellectual property rights, which may restrict us from leveraging our brand in a manner consistent with our business goals.
our real estate investments businesses, including our real estate investment programs and co-investment activities, subject us to performance and real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flow and impact our ability to raise capital for future investments.
the revenue, net income and cash flow generated by our investment management business line within our real estate investments segment can be volatile primarily because the management, transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements. in the event that any of the investment programs that our investment management business manages were to perform poorly, our revenue, net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease, which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn. moreover, we could experience losses on co-investments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance. investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance.
an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves co-investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments. as of december 31, 2019, we had committed $72.1 million to fund future co-investments in our real estate investments segment, approximately $46.3 million of which is expected to be funded during 2020. in addition to required future capital contributions, some of the co-investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets. the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to
our interests in these investments, including damage to our reputation with our co-investment partners and clients, as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other co-investors. participating as a co-investor is an important part of our investment management line of business, which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments.
selective investment in real estate projects is critical to our development services business strategy within our real estate investments segment, and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments. as of december 31, 2019, we had 16 real estate projects consolidated in our financial statements. in addition, as of december 31, 2019, we were involved as a principal (in most cases, co-investing with our clients) in approximately 70 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of $176.5 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of $50.1 million. as of december 31, 2019, we also had guarantees of $21.8 million in our u.k. development business, which relate to our share of certain cost overrun guarantees of unconsolidated subsidiaries, as well as guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries in our u.s. development business with outstanding balances of $6.6 million.
during the ordinary course of business within our development services business line, we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget. there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees. if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period, our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow. in many cases, we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss, or incentive participation fee.
the success of our global workplace solutions segment depends on our ability to enter into mutually beneficial contracts, deliver high quality levels of service and accurately assess working capital requirements.
contracts for our global workplace solutions clients often include complex terms regarding payment of fees, risk transfer, liability limitations, termination, due diligence and  transition timeframe. further, the facilities management and project management businesses within our global workplace solutions segment are often impacted by transition activities in the first year of a contract as well as the timing of starting operations on these large client contracts. if we are unable to negotiate contracts with our clients in a timely manner and on mutually beneficial terms, or there is a delay in becoming fully operational, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted. further, if we fail to deliver the high quality levels of service expected by our clients, it may result in reputational and financial damage, and could impact our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients.
the success of our global workplace solutions segment also requires us to accurately model the working capital needs of this business. should we fail to accurately assess working capital requirements, the cash flow generated by this business may be adversely impacted. in addition, if we do not accurately assess the creditworthiness of a client or if a client's creditworthiness changes during the term of the contract, we could potentially be unable to collect on any outstanding payments.
a significant portion of our loan origination and servicing business depends upon our relationships with u.s. government sponsored enterprises.
a significant portion of our loan origination and servicing business depends upon our relationship with the federal national mortgage association, or fannie mae, and the federal home loan mortgage corporation, or freddie mac, collectively the government sponsored enterprises, or gses. numerous pieces of legislation seeking various types of changes designed to reform the gses and the u.s. housing finance system have been introduced in congress including among other things, changes to the role the gses play in the u.s. housing finance system and the winding down or conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac over a period of years. legislation which curtails the gses activities and/or alters the structure or existence of the gses, if enacted, may result in a significant
decrease in our loan origination and servicing revenue and could have a significant impact on our loan origination and servicing business. further, as an approved seller/servicer for the gses, we are required to comply with various eligibility criteria and are required to originate and service loans in accordance with their individual program requirements. failure to comply with these requirements may result in termination or withdrawal of our approval to sell and service the gses loans. our status as an approved seller/servicer may be terminated by the applicable gse at any time for cause.
our investments in our flexible workspace offering, hana, may prove to be unsuccessful.
while we have taken a measured approach regarding our investment into our flexible workspace offering, hana, there is a possibility that these investments will prove to be unsuccessful. given our measured approach, we believe the impact to our overall business would not be material at this time, but we expect to continue opening new hana locations during the course of 2020. as this product offering expands, the potential impact to our overall financial condition will increase. should these locations be unsuccessful, we may not earn a positive return on the capital invested and we may incur future operating losses associated with the cost of operating leases required for this business.
we may be subject to actual or perceived conflicts of interest.
similar to other global services companies with different business lines and a broad client base, we may be subject to potential actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of our services. for example, conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions. in certain cases, we are also subject to fiduciary obligations to our clients. in such situations, our policies are designed to give full disclosure and transparency to all parties as well as implement appropriate barriers on information-sharing and other activities to ensure each party's interests are protected; however, there can be no assurance that our policies will be successful in every case. if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and appropriately address potential conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations, there could be an adverse effect on our business or reputation regardless of whether any such claims have merit. in addition, it is possible that in some jurisdictions, regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for certain parties where potential conflicts may exist even with informed consent, which could limit our market share in those markets. there can be no assurance that potential conflicts of interest will not adversely affect us.
infrastructure disruptions may disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients.
our ability to conduct a global business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. this may include disruptions as a result of political instability, public health crises, attacks on our information technology systems, terrorist attacks, interruptions or delays in services from third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers, employee errors or malfeasance, building defects, utility outages and natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. the infrastructure disruptions we may experience as a result of such disasters could also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of the real estate investments we make through our investment management and development services businesses.
the buildings we manage for clients, which include some of the world's largest office properties and retail centers, are used by people daily. we also manage the critical facilities (including data centers) that our clients rely on to serve the public and their customers, where unplanned downtime could potentially disrupt other parts of their businesses or society. as a result, fires, earthquakes, floods, other natural disasters, building defects, terrorist attacks, mass shootings or infrastructure disruptions can result in significant loss of life or injury, and, to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties, we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm.
our policies, procedures and programs to safeguard the health, safety and security of our employees and others may not be adequate.
we have more than 100,000 employees as well as independent contractors working in over 100 countries. we have undertaken to implement what we believe to be best practices to safeguard the health, safety and security of our employees, independent contractors, clients and others at our worksites. however, if these policies, procedures and programs are not adequate, or employees do not receive related adequate training or follow them for any reason, the consequences may be severe to us, including serious injury or loss of life, which could impair our operations and cause us to incur significant legal liability or fines as well as reputational damage. our insurance may not cover, or may be insufficient to cover, any legal liability or fines that we incur for health, safety or security incidents.
our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve risks that are often outside of our control and that, if realized, could harm our business.
we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments, select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally, and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future. under our affiliate program, we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage, property management or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources, in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation's revenue, profits or transactional activity. in many of these joint ventures and affiliations, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates, and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives. in addition, the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.
a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which could cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly.
a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal. historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter, and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year. earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar year-end. this variance among periods makes it difficult to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. in addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, political, economic or other unforeseen disruptions occurring in the fourth quarter, particularly those that impact our ability to close large transactions, may have a proportionally larger effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
risks related to our indebtedness our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us, and in the event of a default, all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable.
as of december 31, 2019, our total debt, excluding notes payable on real estate (which are generally nonrecourse to us) and warehouse lines of credit (which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary, cbre capital markets, and are secured by our related warehouse receivables), was $1.8 billion. for the year ended december 31, 2019, our interest expense was $103.0 million.
our debt instruments impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries. these restrictions affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, our ability to:
o   plan for or react to market conditions;
o   meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and
o   finance ongoing operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest, including:
our credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda (as defined in the credit agreement) to consolidated interest expense (as defined in the credit agreement) of 2.00x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt (as defined in the credit agreement) less available cash (as defined in the credit agreement) to consolidated ebitda of 4.25x (and, in the case of the first four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a qualified acquisition (as defined in the credit agreement), 4.75x) as of the end of each fiscal quarter. on this basis, our coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense was 22.62x for the year ended december 31, 2019, and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to consolidated ebitda was 0.44x as of december 31, 2019. our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required. we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement.
a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments. if any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. in addition, a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments.
in july 2017, the financial conduct authority (the authority that regulates libor) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021. the alternative reference rates committee, or arrc, has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate, or sofr, is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to usd-libor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to usd-libor. arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from usd-libor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to usd-libor. establishing a replacement rate for libor in this manner may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on our debt if libor was available in its current form.
we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our indebtedness. in addition, in the event of a credit-ratings downgrade, our ability to borrow and the costs of such borrowings could be adversely affected.
subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants, we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur, and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments. in addition, moody's investors service, inc. and standard & poor's ratings services, rate our significant outstanding debt. these ratings, and any downgrades of them, may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings.
risks related to our information technology, cybersecurity and data protection failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market.
our business relies heavily on information technology, including solutions provided by third parties, to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients. if we are unable to effectively execute or maintain our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform, our ability to deliver high-quality services may be materially impaired. in addition, we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies. implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or
technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules. if we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays, or fail to exploit new technologies, then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted. similarly, our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business. failure to successfully provide such tools and systems, or ensure that employees have properly adopted them, could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes.
failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including personally identifiable and client information, intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us.
security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks, as well as that of third-party vendors, could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs, which could cause material harm to our business and financial results. in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees, contractors and vendors, in our data centers and on our networks. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations. although we and our vendors continue to implement new security measures and regularly conduct employee training, our information technology and infrastructure may nevertheless be vulnerable to cyberattacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. an increasing number of companies that rely on information and technology networks have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently, may be difficult to detect, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. to date, we have not yet experienced any cybersecurity breaches that have been material, either individually or in the aggregate. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent any material events from occurring in the future.
we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect sensitive information, such as the european union's general data protection regulation, china's cyber security law, various u.s. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information, including the california consumer privacy act, and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions. these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us.
a significant actual or potential theft, loss, corruption, exposure, fraudulent use or misuse of client, employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us. such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients, harm our relationships with contractors and vendors, damage our reputation, result in the loss of a competitive advantage, impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, revenues, competitive position and investor confidence. additionally, we rely on third parties to support our information and technology networks, including cloud storage solution providers, and as a result have less direct control over our data and information technology systems. such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems, for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation.
interruption or failure of our information technology, communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively, which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results.
our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure. our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or our infrastructure. our information technology and communications systems are
vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, system malfunctions, computer viruses, cyberattacks, natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, acts of war or terrorism, employee errors or malfeasance, or other events which are beyond our control. with respect to cyberattacks and viruses, these pose growing threats to many companies, and we have been a target and may continue to be a target of such threats, which could expose us to liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs and cause material harm to our business and financial results. in addition, the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on third-party technologies, systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss, corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients, contractors and vendors, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. furthermore, while we have certain business interruption insurance coverage and various contractual arrangements that can serve to mitigate costs, damages and liabilities, any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers, business partners and other third parties. we have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities, and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and as a result, our future operating results could be materially adversely affected.
our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data. a portion of this data is purchased or licensed from third-party providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability. a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals and/or our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position, and our operating results could be adversely affected.
legal and regulatory related risks we are subject to various litigation and regulatory risks and may face financial liabilities and/or damage to our reputation as a result of litigation or regulatory proceedings.
our businesses are exposed to various litigation and regulatory risks, especially within our valuations business. although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk, insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures. additionally, our insurance policies may not cover us in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct. accordingly, an adverse result in a litigation against us, or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us (and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured), could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, an adverse result in regulatory proceedings, if applicable, could result in fines or other liabilities or adversely impact our operations. in addition, we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for high-caliber professional services to attract and retain clients. as a result, allegations against us, or the announcement of a regulatory investigation involving us, irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation or investigation, may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects.
our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof. if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us, or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes, we may incur significant financial penalties.
we are subject to numerous federal, state, local and non-u.s. laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business. brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each u.s. state and certain non-u.s. jurisdictions in which we perform these services. if we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license, or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses, we may be required to pay fines (including treble damages in certain states) or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked. a number of our services, including the services provided by our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, cbre capital markets and cbre global investors, are subject to regulation by the sec, financial industry regulatory authority, or finra, or other self-regulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business. we could be subject to
disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.
we are also subject to laws of broader applicability, such as tax, securities, environmental, employment laws and anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption laws, including the fair labor standards act, occupational health and safety regulations, u.s. state wage-and-hour laws, the u.s. fcpa and the u.k. bribery act. failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters.
as the size and scope of our business has increased significantly, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from non-compliance have increased. the global economic crisis resulted in increased government and legislative activity and we expect that we will continue to see the introduction of new legislation and additional changes to rules and regulations in the future. new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business, both within and outside of the united states, as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business, including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients. we are unable to predict how any of these new laws, rules, regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we also operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes, and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate. in addition, from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions. due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate, we are often required to make subjective determinations. the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law. such disagreements could result in disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter.
we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate.
various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property. in our role as a property or facility manager or developer, we could be held liable as an operator for such costs. this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. if we fail to disclose environmental issues, we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property. if we incur any such liability, our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties, or borrow funds using such properties as collateral. in the event of a substantial liability, our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages, or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities. additionally, liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business.
risks related to our internal controls and accounting policies if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.
the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. we are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. as disclosed in part ii, item 9a, during the fourth quarter of 2019, management identified several material weaknesses in internal control related to our global workplace solutions segment in the europe, middle east & africa region, or gws emea. management concluded that during 2019, as gws emea increased in complexity and grew in both size and scale, management did not prioritize an appropriate level of oversight, a sufficient number of capable resources or training for control preparers and reviewers to address internal controls over financial reporting. as a result, even though a material misstatement was not identified in the gws emea financial statements, it was determined that there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in the gws emea financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis and, therefore, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31, 2019. we are committed to remediating the gws emea material weaknesses in a timely manner and have begun the process of executing remediation plans. these measures will result in additional administrative expenses related to enhanced training and hiring of additional personnel. internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. if we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner, or are otherwise unable to maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our stock price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.
under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations, stockholders' equity and our stock price. a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the economic environment, slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period, could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods. if we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary, then we would record such additional charges, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview we are the world's largest commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2019 revenue, with leading global market positions in our leasing, property sales, occupier outsourcing and valuation businesses. as of december 31, 2019, we operated in more than 530 offices worldwide and have more than 100,000 employees, excluding independent affiliates.
our business is focused on providing services to real estate occupiers and investors. for occupiers, we provide facilities management, project management, transaction (both property sales and leasing) and consulting services, among others. for investors, we provide capital markets (property sales, mortgage origination, sales and servicing), leasing, investment management, property management, valuation and development services, among others. we provide services under the following brand names: "cbre" (real estate advisory and outsourcing services); "cbre global investors" (investment management); "trammell crow company" (u.s. development); "telford homes" (u.k. development) and "hana" (flexible-space solutions).
our revenue mix has shifted in recent years toward more contractual revenue as occupiers and investors increasingly prefer to purchase integrated, account-based services from firms that meet the full spectrum of their needs nationally and globally. we believe we are well-positioned to capture a substantial share of growing market opportunities. we generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year portfolio and per-project contracts) and commissions on transactions. our contractual, fee-for-services businesses generally involve occupier outsourcing (including facilities and project management), property management, investment management, appraisal/valuation and loan servicing. in addition, our leasing services business line is largely recurring in nature over time.
in 2019, we generated revenue from a highly diversified base of clients, including more than 90 of the fortune 100 companies. we have been an s&p 500 company since 2006 and in 2019 we were ranked #146 on the fortune 500. we have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in the lipsey company survey for 19 years in a row (including 2020). we have also been rated a world's most ethical company by the ethisphere institute for seven consecutive years (including 2020), and are included in the dow jones world sustainability index and the bloomberg gender equality index.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, or gaap, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. actual results may differ from those estimates. we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition to recognize revenue in a transaction with a customer, we evaluate the five steps of the accounting standards codification topic 606 revenue recognition framework: (1) identify the contract; (2) identify the performance obligations(s) in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation(s) and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied.
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with this five step framework. understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time, amount, and method to recognize revenue for each transaction requires significant judgement. these significant judgements include: (i) determining what point in time or what measure of progress depicts the transfer of control to the customer; (ii) applying the series guidance to certain performance obligations satisfied over time; (iii) estimating how and when contingencies, or other forms of variable consideration, will impact the timing and amount of recognition of revenue and (iv) determining whether we control third party services before they are transferred to the customer in order to appropriately recognize the
associated fees on either a gross or net basis. the timing and amount of revenue recognition in a period could vary if different judgments were made. our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue, incentive-based management fees, development fees and third party fees associated with our occupier outsourcing and property management services. for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies, see the revenue recognition section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, or this annual report.
goodwill and other intangible assets our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting, which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value. the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, we use a variety of valuation methods including present value, depreciated replacement cost, market values (where available) and selling prices less costs to dispose. we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
assumptions must often be made in determining fair values, particularly where observable market values do not exist. assumptions may include discount rates, growth rates, cost of capital, royalty rates, tax rates and remaining useful lives. these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded. different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities. since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense, different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews.
we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually, or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status, in accordance with the "intangibles - goodwill and other" topic of the financial accounting standards board, or fasb, accounting standards codification, or asc, (topic 350). we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment with respect to any of our reporting units to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is needed. we are permitted to assess based on qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would conduct a quantitative goodwill impairment test. if not, we do not need to apply the quantitative test. the qualitative test is elective and we can go directly to the quantitative test rather than making a more-likely-than-not assessment based on an evaluation of qualitative factors. when performing a quantitative test, we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. management's judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model. these assumptions include revenue growth rates, profit margin percentages, discount rates, etc. due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business's fair value and the relative size of our goodwill, if different assumptions and estimates were used, it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis.
for additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing, see notes 2 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the "accounting for income taxes," topic of the fasb asc (topic 740). deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
accounting for tax positions requires judgments, including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties. we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods. while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31, 2019 and 201 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740, as applicable, the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material.
on december 22, 2017, the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act) was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code, including a decrease to the u.s. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a one-time transition tax (i.e. toll charge or, the transition tax) on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31, 2017. we are paying the federal tax liability for the transition tax in annual interest-free installments over a period of eight years through 2025 as allowed by the tax act.
our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.
see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes.
new accounting pronouncements see new accounting pronouncements discussion within note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
seasonality a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year. revenue, earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end.
inflation our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by inflation. however, to date, we believe that general inflation has not had a material impact upon our operations.
items affecting comparability when you read our financial statements and the information included in this annual report, you should consider that we have experienced, and continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results. we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future.
macroeconomic conditions economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. these include: overall economic activity and employment growth; interest rate levels and changes in interest rates; the cost and availability of credit; and the impact of tax and regulatory policies. periods of economic weakness or recession, significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business.
compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production. as a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. in addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance, and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved. additionally, our contractual revenues have continued to increase primarily as a result of growth in our outsourcing business, and we believe this contractual revenue should help offset the negative impacts that macroeconomic deterioration could have on other parts of our business. nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our consolidated operations and financial condition.
commercial real estate markets in the united states have generally been marked by increased demand for space, falling vacancies and higher rents since 2010. during this time, healthy u.s. property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals, including higher occupancy rates and rents, broad, low-cost credit availability and increased institutional capital allocations to commercial real estate. in 2019, u.s. sales market activity improved from 2018 levels, as significant capital continued to be targeted at commercial real estate and relatively low-cost financing remained plentiful. the market for commercial real estate leasing was solid in 2019, though leasing market volumes weakened somewhat in the latter stages of the year.
in europe, leasing activity was relatively stable in 2019; sales market volumes were soft for much of the year, but rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter. the united kingdom's economy and property market were generally solid from the june 2016 referendum to leave the european union through 2018. however, in 2019, continued uncertainty throughout the year about the date and the terms on which the united kingdom would leave the european union led to lower lease and sales volumes. the december 2019 united kingdom general election and exit from the european union on january 31, 2020 brought some clarity and a return of investor confidence, but uncertainty remains over the united kingdom's long-term economic and trade relationship with the european union.
in asia pacific, leasing activity declined significantly in 2019 amid rising geopolitical uncertainty and slowing regional economies. however, investment activity was more resilient, declining only modestly from 2018 levels. asia pacific investors continue to be a significant source of real estate investment capital in the region and globally.
real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate. actively managed public real estate equity funds and programs have been pressured by a shift in investor preferences from active to passive portfolio strategies.
the performance of our global real estate services and investment businesses depends on sustained economic growth and solid job creation; stable global credit markets; and positive business and investor sentiment.
effects of acquisitions we historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add and enhance service competencies around the world. on october 1, 2019, we acquired telford homes plc (telford) to expand our real estate development business outside the united states (telford acquisition). a leading developer of multifamily residential properties in the london area, telford is reported in our real estate investments segment. telford was acquired for £267.1 million, or $328.5 million along with the assumption of $110.7 million (£90.0 million) of debt and the acquisition of cash from telford of $7.9 million (£6.4 million). the telford acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
on june 12, 2018, we acquired facilitysource through a stock purchase and merger agreement with its stockholders, including facilitysource holdings, llc, wp x finance, lp and warburg pincus x partners, lp (facilitysource acquisition). facilitysource, which is reported in our global workplace solutions segment, was acquired to help us build a tech-enabled supply chain capability for the occupier outsourcing industry, which would drive meaningfully differentiated outcomes for leading occupiers of real estate. the net purchase price was approximately $266.5 million in cash, with $263.0 million paid in 2018 and $3.5 million paid in 2019. we financed the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in strengthening our service offerings. the companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform, or independent affiliates in which, in some cases, we held a small equity interest. in early 2020, we acquired leading local facilities management firms in spain and italy and a u.s. firm that helps companies reduce telecommunications costs.
during 2019, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions: a leading advanced analytics software company based in the united kingdom, a commercial and residential real estate appraisal firm headquartered in florida, our former affiliate in omaha, a project management firm in australia, a valuation and consulting business in switzerland, a leading project management firm in israel, a full-service real estate firm in san antonio with a focus on retail, office, medical office and land, and a debt-focused real estate investment management business in the united kingdom. during 2018, we completed six in-fill acquisitions, the largest of which was the purchase of the remaining 50% equity interest in our longstanding new england joint venture. we also acquired a retail leasing and property management firm in australia, two firms in israel (our former affiliate and a majority interest in a local facilities management provider), a commercial real estate services provider in san antonio, and a provider of real estate and facilities consulting services to healthcare companies across the united states.
we believe strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position - or expand our capabilities - within targeted markets or business lines. in general, however, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating income and net income as a result of transaction-related expenditures, including severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, as well as costs and charges associated with integrating the acquired business and integrating its financial and accounting systems into our own.
our acquisition agreements often require us to pay deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments, subject to the acquired company achieving certain performance metrics, and/or the passage of time as well as other conditions. as of december 31, 2019, we have accrued deferred consideration totaling $111.7 million, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
international operations we continue to monitor developments related to the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union and the uncertainty of the long-term economic and trade relationship between the united kingdom and european union. the continued uncertainty has the potential to impact our businesses in the united kingdom and the rest of europe, particularly sales and leasing activity in the united kingdom. in addition, any associated currency volatility could impact our results of operations. we are also monitoring the impact of a coronavirus that emerged in wuhan, china in december 2019 on business conditions and operations in china and other regions in which we operate.
as we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. our real estate investments business has a significant amount of euro-denominated assets under management, or aum, as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe. in addition, our global workplace solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, such as the euro and the british pound sterling. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum, revenue and earnings.
during the year ended december 31, 201, approximately 42% of our business was transacted in non-u.s. dollar currencies, the majority of which included the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan, czech koruna, danish krone, euro, hong kong dollar, indian rupee, israeli shekel, japanese yen, korean won, mexican peso, new zealand dollar, polish zloty, singapore dollar, swedish krona, swiss franc and thai baht. the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies (u.s. dollars in thousands):
although we operate globally, we report our results in u.s. dollars. as a result, the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results. for example, we estimate that had the british pound sterling-to-u.s. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended december 31, 2019, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $3.6 million. had the euro-to-u.s. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the year ended december 31, 2019, the net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $9.5 million. these hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into u.s. dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10% change in the u.s. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.
due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. in addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the u.s. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. our international operations also are subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which affect the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. we routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.

fee revenue and adjusted ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap. when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap. we generally use these non-gaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. we believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of fee revenue and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients. we believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company's overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients, and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business.
ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and intangible asset impairments. amounts shown for adjusted ebitda further remove (from ebitda) the impact of certain cash and non-cash items related to acquisitions, certain carried interest incentive compensation expense (reversal) to align with the timing of associated revenue, costs associated with our reorganization, including cost-savings initiatives, and other non-recurring costs. we believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending.
adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. this measure may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. we also use adjusted ebitda as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.

we reported consolidated net income of $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019 on revenue of $23.9 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $1.1 billion on revenue of $21.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018.
our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31, 2019 increased by $2.6 billion, or 12.0%, as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher revenue in our global workplace solutions segment (up 14.5%) and improved revenue in our advisory services segment due to property and advisory project management revenue (up 9.6%) as well as
increased advisory leasing (up 6.2%), advisory sales (up 7.6%) and commercial mortgage origination activity (up 12.7%). higher revenue in our real estate investments segment (up 23.5%) driven by the telford acquisition also contributed to the increase. foreign currency translation had a 2.1% negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily driven by weakness in the argentine peso, australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, euro and indian rupee.
our cost of revenue on a consolidated basis increased by $2.2 billion, or 13.6%, during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global workplace solutions segment. in addition, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance. accordingly, the increase in advisory leasing and sales transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense. higher costs in our property and advisory project management business as well as higher costs in our real estate investments segment (due to the telford acquisition) also contributed to the increase. these items were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation, which had a 2.2% positive impact on total cost of revenue during the year ended december 31, 2019. cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased from 77.1% for the year ended december 31, 2018 to 78.2% for the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily driven by our mix of revenue, with revenue from our global workplace solutions segment, which has a lower margin than our other revenue streams, comprising a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior period.
our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $70.2 million, or 2.1%, during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we incurred $47.0 million of costs in connection with our reorganization (including cost-savings initiatives) as compared to $35.2 million of such costs incurred in the prior year. additionally, in the current year, we incurred higher payroll-related costs, higher integration and other costs associated with acquisitions (primarily due to the telford acquisition), costs related to a legal entity restructuring and increased occupancy costs. these items were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation, which had a 2.2% positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2019, as well as lower bonuses in our real estate investment segment (driven by lower property sales during 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year, which were reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries). during the year ended december 31, 2018, we also incurred $8.9 million of costs as a result of a litigation settlement, which did not recur during the year ended december 31, 2019. operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 15.8% for the year ended december 31, 2018 to 14.4% for the year ended december 31, 2019, reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our business.
our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by $12.8 million, or 2.8%, during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. this decrease was primarily attributable to $27.4 million of lower amortization expense largely associated with intangibles from prior acquisitions. the decrease in amortization expense was partially offset by a rise in depreciation expense of $14.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2019 driven by technology-related capital expenditures.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, we recorded an intangible asset impairment of $89.8 million in our real estate investments segment. this non-cash write-off resulted from a review of the anticipated cash flows and the decrease in assets under management in our public securities business driven in part by continued industry-wide shift in investor preference for passive investment programs.
our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis increased by $4.9 million, or 33.2%, during the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. these gains resulted from property sales within our real estate investments segment.
our other income on a consolidated basis was $28.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 versus $93.0 million for the same period in the prior year. the income during the year ended december 31, 2019 was primarily driven by net realized and unrealized gains related to co-investments in our real estate securities business within our real estate investments segment. the income in the prior year included a one-time gain of $100.4 million associated with remeasuring our investment in a previously unconsolidated subsidiary in new england in our advisory services segment to fair value as of the date we acquired the remaining controlling interest.
our consolidated interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $12.9 million, or 13.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. this decrease was primarily driven by the early redemption, in full, of the $800.0 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 5.00% senior notes in the first quarter of 2018. lower interest expense associated with the term loans under our credit agreement (driven by more favorable interest rates stemming from our amendment to our credit agreement in 2019) also contributed to the decrease.
our write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $2.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to $28.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the costs for the year ended december 31, 2019 were incurred in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement. the costs for the year ended december 31, 2018 included a $20.0 million premium paid and the write-off of $8.0 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the early redemption, in full, of the $800.0 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 5.00% senior notes.
our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $69.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to $313.1 million for the same period in 2018. our effective tax rate decreased from 22.7% for the year ended december 31, 2018 to 5.1% for the year ended december 31, 2019. the lower tax rate for year ended december 31, 2019 was primarily driven by a $277.2 million net tax benefit recorded in 2019 attributable to outside basis differences recognized as a result of a legal entity restructuring.
we reported consolidated net income of $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018 on revenue of $21.3 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $697.1 million on revenue of $18.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2017.
our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31, 2018 increased by $2.7 billion, or 14.6%, as compared to the year ended december 30, 2017. the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher revenue in our global workplace solutions segment (up 14.6%) and improved revenue in our advisory services segment due to property and advisory project management revenue (up 17.7%), increased advisory leasing (up 18.8%), advisory sales (up 5.9%) and commercial mortgage origination activity (up 18.4%). higher revenue in our real estate investments segment (up 17.0%) also contributed to the increase. in addition, foreign currency translation had a 0.5% positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by strength in the british pound sterling and euro, partially offset by weakness in the argentine peso and brazilian real.
our cost of revenue on a consolidated basis increased by $2.1 billion, or 15.0%, during the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global workplace solutions segment. in addition, as previously mentioned, our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis, which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance. accordingly, the increase in advisory leasing and sales transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense. higher costs in our property and advisory project management business also contributed to the increase. lastly, foreign currency translation had a 0.5% negative impact on total cost of revenue during the year ended december 31, 2018. cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased from 76.8% for the year ended december 31, 2017 to 77.1% for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by our revenue mix, with revenue from our global workplace solutions segment, which has a lower margin than our other revenue streams, comprising a higher percentage of revenue in 2018 than in 2017.
our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $507.1 million, or 17.7%, during the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. the increase was mostly driven by higher payroll-related costs (including increases in bonus and stock compensation expense), higher carried interest expense and increases in consulting, marketing and occupancy costs. during 2018, we also incurred $35.2 million of costs incurred in connection with our reorganization (including cost-savings initiatives) and $8.9 million of costs as a result of a litigation settlement, the impact of which was partly offset by lower integration and other costs associated with acquisitions. foreign currency translation also had a 0.8% negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2018. operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 15.3% for the year ended december 31, 2017 to 15.8% for the year ended december 31, 2018, partially driven by higher bonus expense in our real estate investments segment with no corresponding increase in revenue (as bonus expense was attributable to an increase in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries) as well as due to the costs incurred in connection with our reorganization.
our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $45.9 million, or 11.3%, during the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. this increase was primarily attributable to a rise in depreciation expense of $25.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 driven by technology-related capital expenditures. higher amortization expense of $20.0 million associated with mortgage servicing rights and intangibles acquired in acquisitions also contributed to the increase.
our other income on a consolidated basis was $93.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to $9.4 million for the same period in 2017. included in other income for the year ended december 31, 2018 was a one-time gain of $100.4 million associated with remeasuring our investment in a previously unconsolidated subsidiary in new england to fair value as of the date we acquired the remaining controlling interest.
our consolidated interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by $28.3 million, or 22.3%, for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. this decrease was primarily driven by the early redemption, in full, of the $800.0 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 5.00% senior notes in the first quarter of 2018.
our write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was $28.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. these costs included a $20.0 million premium paid and the write-off of $8.0 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the early redemption, in full, of the $800.0 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 5.00% senior notes.
our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $313.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to $467.8 million for the same period in 2017. our provision for income taxes for 2018 included a net expense true-up of $13.3 million resulting from completion of accounting for the tax act. our provision for income taxes for 2017 included net expense of $143.4 million for the provisional charge related to the tax act. these net expenses were primarily comprised of a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, net of a tax benefit from the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower u.s. corporate income tax rate and the release of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits that will decrease the liability related to the transition tax. excluding these net charges associated with the tax act, our effective tax rate, would have been 21.7% for the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to 27.7% for the year ended december 31, 2017. we benefited from a lower u.s. corporate tax rate, with such rate being 35% in 2017 versus 21% in 2018. the effect of the decrease in the u.s. corporate tax rate was partially offset by discrete tax benefits for the year ended december 31, 2017 from the re-measurement of income tax exposures relating to prior periods and release of valuation allowances on foreign income tax credits that were expected to be utilized with no similar items for the year ended december 31, 2018.
segment operations on august 17, 2018, we announced a new organizational structure that became effective on january 1, 2019. under the new structure, we organize our operations around, and publicly report our financial results on, three global business segments: (1) advisory services; (2) global workplace solutions; and (3) real estate investments. for additional information on our segments, see note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
advisory services the following table summarizes our results of operations for our advisory services operating segment for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands):

(1)   primarily represents severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our reorganization announced in the third quarter of 2018 that became effective on january 1, 2019.
revenue increased by $629.5 million, or 7.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher leasing, sales and commercial mortgage origination activity as well as improved property and project management revenue. foreign currency translation had a 1.7% negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily driven by weakness in the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan, euro and indian rupee.
cost of revenue increased by $421.6 million, or 8.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to higher commission expense resulting from improved leasing and sales transaction revenue. higher costs in our property and project management business also contributed to the increase. foreign currency translation had a 1.7% positive impact on total cost of revenue during the year ended december 31, 2019. cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent at 60.3% for the year ended december 31, 2019 versus 59.8% for the same period in 2018.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $9.0 million, or 0.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was largely driven by higher payroll-related costs (partially driven by increased headcount) and higher occupancy costs. additionally, in the current year, we incurred $6.9 million of costs related to a legal entity restructuring. these items were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation, which had a 2.1% positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2019. during the year ended december 31, 2019, we also incurred $10.5 million of costs in connection with our reorganization (including cost-savings initiatives) as compared to $34.5 million of such costs incurred in the prior year. lastly, during the year ended december 31, 2018, we incurred $8.9 million of costs as a result of a litigation settlement, which did not recur in 2019.
in connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans for which the company retains servicing rights, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the retained mortgage servicing rights (msrs) on the date the loans are sold. upon origination of a mortgage loan held for sale, the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights to be retained is included in the forecasted proceeds from the anticipated loan sale and results in a net gain (which is reflected in revenue). subsequent to the initial recording, msrs are amortized (within amortization expense) and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. they are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that the servicing income is expected to be received. for the year ended december 31, 2019, msrs contributed to operating income $182.4 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $123.0 million of amortization of related intangible assets. for the year ended december 31, 2018, msrs contributed to operating income $173.7 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $115.7 million of amortization of related intangible assets.
revenue increased by $1.1 billion, or 14.4%, for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher leasing, sales and commercial mortgage origination activity as well as improved property and project revenue. foreign currency translation had a 0.3% positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by the strength in the british pound sterling and euro, partially offset by weakness in the australian dollar and brazilian real.
cost of revenue increased by $685.6 million, or 15.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to higher commission expense resulting from improved leasing and sales transaction revenue. higher costs in our property and project management business also contributed to the increase. foreign currency translation had a 0.4% negative impact on total cost of revenue during the year ended december 31, 2018. cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent at 59.8% for the year ended december 31, 2018 versus 59.1% for the same period in 2017.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $266.8 million, or 14.1%, for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase was largely driven by higher payroll-related costs (partially driven by increased headcount) and higher occupancy costs. during the year ended december 31, 2018, we also incurred $34.5 million of severance costs in connection with our reorganization, including cost-savings initiatives, as well as $8.9 million of costs as a result of a litigation settlement. foreign currency translation had a 0.7% negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2018.
for the year ended december 31, 2018, msrs contributed to operating income $173.7 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $115.7 million of amortization of related intangible assets. for the year ended december 31, 201, msrs contributed to operating income $145.1 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $98.6 million of amortization of related intangible assets.

cost-savings initiatives (1)
(1)   primarily represents severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our reorganization announced in the third quarter of 2018 that became effective on january 1, 2019.
revenue increased by $125.9 million, or 23.5%, for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by the telford acquisition in our development services line of business. foreign currency translation had a 2.6% negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2019, primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling and euro.
cost of revenue was $85.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019 and was attributable to telford, which we acquired on october 1, 2019.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $44.9 million, or 7.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by costs incurred in connection with the telford acquisition as well as higher carried interest expense. higher costs (primarily payroll-related and occupancy) attributable to investments in our new flexible space offering also contributed to the increase. these items were partially offset by lower bonuses in our development services line of business (driven by lower property sales in 2019 as compared to 2018, which were reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries). foreign currency translation also had a 1.8% positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 2019.
a roll forward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31, 2019 is as follows (dollars in billions):
market appreciation                  2.1                       1.2                 2.2               5.5
aum generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures. our aum is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. our assets under management consist of:
•   the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing. committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our aum. the value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. in the case of real estate operating companies, the total value of real properties controlled by the companies, generally through joint ventures, is included in aum; and
•   the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds investments.
our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.
revenue increased by $77.6 million, or 17.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017, primarily driven by higher asset management and incentive fees as well as carried interest revenue in our global investment management line of business and higher incentive and development fees in our development services line of business. foreign currency translation also had a 2.0% positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by the strength of the british pound sterling and euro.
operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $130.4 million, or 28.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, primarily driven by higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) and higher carried interest expense. foreign currency translation had a 1.5% negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31, 201.
a roll forward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31, 2018 is as follows (dollars in billions):
market appreciation (depreciation)         1.6                      (0.1   )            (1.6   )          (0.1   )
we describe above how we calculate aum. also, as noted above, our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.
liquidity and capital resources we believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and, as necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. our expected capital requirements for 2020 include up to approximately $385 million of anticipated capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions. as of december 31, 2019, we had aggregate commitments of $72.1 million to fund future co-investments in our real estate investments business, $46.3 million of which is expected to be funded in 2020. additionally, as of december 31, 2019, we are committed to fund $50.1 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our real estate investments business, which we may be required to fund at any time. as of december 31, 2019, we had $2.8 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facility.
we have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital expenditure and general investment requirements (including strategic in-fill acquisitions) and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements. in the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition, we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive. we may also, from time to time in our sole discretion, purchase, redeem, or retire our existing senior notes, through tender offers, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, or otherwise.
as noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing. in the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. however, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions.
our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of three elements. the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. if our cash flow is insufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates. we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.
the second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. as of december 31, 201 and 201, we had accrued $111.7 million ($41.6 million of which was a current liability) and $136.3 million ($41.7 million of which was a current liability), respectively, of deferred purchase consideration, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
lastly, in october 2016, we announced that our board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $250.0 million of our class a common stock over three years. as of december 31, 2018, we spent $161.0 million to repurchase 3,980,656 shares of our class a common stock with an average price paid per share of $40.43. during the month of january 2019, under the october 2016 program, we spent $45.1 million to repurchase an additional 1,144,449 shares of our class a common stock with an average price paid per share of $39.38. in february 2019, our board of directors authorized a new program for the company to repurchase up to $300.0 million of our class a common stock over three years, effective march 11, 2019. the previous program terminated upon the effectiveness of the new program. in both august 2019 and november 2019, our board of directors authorized an additional $100.0 million under our new program, bringing the total authorized amount under the new program to a total of $500.0 million as of march 2, 2020.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, under the march 2019 program, we spent $100.0 million to repurchase 1,936,458 shares of our class a common stock with an average price paid per share of $51.64. as of march 2, 2020, we had $400.0 million of capacity remaining under our current stock repurchase program. our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future stock repurchases with existing cash. the timing of future repurchases, and the actual amounts repurchased, will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions and other factors.
historical cash flows operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $92.1 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved operating performance, partially offset by lower distribution of earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries during the year ended december 31, 2019.
net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of $236.8 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved operating performance as well as a higher distribution of earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries during the year ended december 31, 2018.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $721.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $160.3 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. this increase was largely driven by an increase of $65.7 million in capital expenditures and higher amounts paid for acquisitions (driven by the telford acquisition) during the year ended december 31, 2019. additionally, higher contributions to unconsolidated subsidiaries and lower distributions received from unconsolidated subsidiaries during the year ended december 31, 2019 contributed to the higher net use of cash in investing activities.
net cash used in investing activities totaled $560.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, an increase of $258.1 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by $204.1 million more incurred for acquisitions (driven by the facilitysource acquisition) and an increase of $49.8 million in capital expenditures during the year ended december 31, 2018.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled $271.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $234.7 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. this decrease was primarily due to the impact of the full redemption of the $800.0 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 5.00% senior notes (including $20.0 million premium) during the year ended december 31, 2018. this was partially offset by the impact of higher net borrowings of $552.7 million from our senior term loans during the year ended december 31, 2018 and the repayment of debt assumed in the telford acquisition of $110.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2019.
net cash used in financing activities totaled $506.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, a decrease of $121.1 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2017. this decrease was primarily due to $1.1 billion of higher net borrowings from our senior term loans during the year ended december 31, 2018, largely offset by the full redemption of the $800.0 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 5.00% senior notes (including $20.0 million premium) as well as the $161.0 million repurchase of our common stock during the year ended december 31, 2018.

(1)   reflects gross outstanding long-term debt balances as of december 31, 2019, assumed to be paid at maturity, excluding unamortized discount, premium and deferred financing costs. see note 11 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report. figures do not include scheduled interest payments. assuming each debt obligation is held until maturity, we estimate that we will make the following interest payments (dollars in thousands): 2020 - $63,000; 2021 to 2022 - $126,000; 2023 to 2024 - $115,874 and thereafter - $38,582.
(2)   the majority of this balance represents our warehouse lines of credit, which are recourse only to our wholly-owned subsidiary cbre capital markets, inc. (cbre capital markets) and are secured by our related warehouse receivables. see notes 5 and 11 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
(3)   see note 12 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
(4)   see note 14 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report. these obligations are related, either wholly or partially, to the future retirement of our employees and such retirement dates are not predictable. an undeterminable portion of this amount will be paid in years one through five.
(5)   reflects gross outstanding notes payable on real estate as of december 31, 2019 (only $0.6 million of which is recourse to us, beyond being recourse to the single-purpose entity that held the real estate asset and was the primary obligor on the note payable), assumed to be paid at maturity, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs. amounts do not include scheduled interest payments. the notes have either fixed or variable interest rates, ranging from 4.29% to 4.75% at december 31, 2019.
(6)   represents deferred obligations related to previous acquisitions, which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 201 set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
(7)   represents outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs, which are included in other current and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2019 set forth in item 8 of this annual report. due to the nature of this item, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain events. accordingly, the entire balance has been reflected as expiring in less than one year.
(8)   as of december 31, 2019, we have a remaining federal tax liability of $107.8 million (of which $14.2 million is due in less than one year) associated with the transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31, 2017. we are paying the federal tax liability for the transition tax in annual interest-free installments over a period of eight years through 2025 as allowed by the tax act.
in addition, as of december 31, 2019, our current and non-current tax liabilities (including interest and penalties) for uncertain tax positions, totaled $141.1 million. of this amount, we can reasonably estimate that $0.5 million will require cash settlement in less than one year. we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions for the remaining $140.6 million. see note 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
(9)   see note 13 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report.
(10)   includes $72.1 million to fund future co-investments in our real estate investments segment, $46.3 million of which is expected to be funded in 2020, and $50.1 million committed to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal, which is callable at any time.
(11)   due to the nature of guarantees, payments could be due at any time upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, including default. accordingly, all guarantees are reflected as expiring in less than one year.
indebtedness our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness and other obligations when due. in addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.
long-term debt we maintain credit facilities with third-party lenders, which we use for a variety of purposes. on october 31, 2017, cbre services, inc. (cbre services), our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a credit agreement (the 2017 credit agreement), which refinanced and replaced our prior credit agreement (the 2015 credit agreement). we used $200.0 million of borrowings from the tranche a term loan facility and $83.0 million of revolving credit facility borrowings under the 2017 credit agreement, in addition to cash on hand, to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2015 credit agreement. on december 20, 2018, cbre global acquisition company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of cbre services, entered into an incremental term loan assumption agreement with a syndicate of banks jointly led by wells fargo bank and national westminster bank plc to establish a euro term loan facility under the 2017 credit agreement in an aggregate principal amount of €400.0 million. the proceeds from the euro term loan facility were used to repay a portion of the u.s. dollar denominated term loans outstanding under the 2017 credit agreement. on march 4, 2019, cbre services entered into an additional incremental assumption agreement with respect to the 2017 credit agreement (the 2017 agreement as amended by such incremental assumption agreement, the 2019 credit agreement), which (i) extended the maturity of the u.s. dollar tranche a term loans under the 2017 credit agreement, (ii) extended the termination date of the revolving credit commitments available under the 2017 credit agreement and (iii) made certain changes to the interest rates and fees applicable to such tranche a term loans and revolving credit commitments. the proceeds from the new tranche a term loan facility under the 2019 credit agreement were used to repay the $300.0 million of tranche a term loans outstanding under the 2017 credit agreement.
the 2019 credit agreement is a senior unsecured credit facility that is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries. as of december 31, 2019, the 2019 credit agreement provided for the following: (1) a $2.8 billion incremental revolving credit facility, which includes the capacity to obtain letters of credit and swingline loans and terminates on march 4, 2024; (2) a $300.0 million incremental tranche a term loan facility maturing on march 4, 2024, requiring quarterly principal payments unless our leverage ratio (as defined in the 2019 credit agreement) is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 on the last day of the fiscal quarter immediately preceding any such payment date and (3) a €400.0 million term loan facility due and payable in full at maturity on december 20, 2023.
